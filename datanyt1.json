                "WASHINGTON — In late January, as China locked down some provinces to contain the spread of the coronavirus, average internet speeds in the country slowed as people who were stuck inside went online more and clogged the networks. In Hubei Province, the epicenter of infections, mobile broadband speeds fell by more than half. In mid-February, when the virus hit Italy, Germany and Spain, internet speeds in those countries also began to deteriorate. And last week, as a wave of stay-at-home orders rolled out across the United States, the average time it took to download videos, emails and documents increased as broadband speeds declined 4.9 percent from the previous week, according to Ookla, a broadband speed testing service. Median download speeds dropped 38 percent in San Jose, Calif., and 24 percent in New York, according to Broadband Now, a consumer broadband research site. Quarantines around the world have made people more reliant on the internet to communicate, work, learn and stay entertained. But as the use of YouTube, Netflix, Zoom videoconferencing, Facebook calls and videogaming has surged to new highs, the stress on internet infrastructure is starting to show in Europe and the United States — and the traffic is probably far from its peak. “This is totally unprecedented,” said Thierry Breton, a European Union commissioner who oversees digital policy and was a chief executive of France Télécom. “We have to be proactive.” To head off problems, European regulators like Mr. Breton have pushed streaming companies such as Netflix and YouTube to reduce the size of their video files so they don’t take up as much bandwidth. In the United States, regulators have given wireless carriers access to more spectrum to bolster the capacity of their networks. Some tech companies have responded to the call to ease internet traffic. YouTube, which is owned by Google, said this week that it would reduce the quality of its videos from high to standard definition across the globe. Disney delayed the start of its Disney Plus streaming service in France by two weeks, and Microsoft’s Xbox asked gaming companies to introduce online updates and new releases only at certain times to prevent network congestion. “We really don’t know how long we’re going to be in this mode for,” Dave Temkin, Netflix’s vice president of network and systems infrastructure, said in a webinar on Wednesday on how the coronavirus could affect internet infrastructure. Internet service providers like Comcast, Vodafone, Verizon and Telefónica have been building out their networks for years to account for increasing demand. But company officials said they had never seen such a steep, sudden surge. Growth that the industry had expected to take a year is happening over days, said Enrique Blanco, the chief technology officer at Telefónica, a Spanish telecommunications company. “In just two days we grew all the traffic we had planned for 2020,” Mr. Blanco said. On Monday, traffic on AT&T’s networks was up 27 percent compared to the same day last month, and last week Verizon experienced a 22 percent increase in traffic on its wireless and fiber broadband service. Wi-Fi calls doubled from their normal volume, the carriers said. In Europe, internet traffic into homes over fixed lines was up more than 30 percent, according to Telefónica. Activities like online gaming and video conferencing have more than doubled, while messages over WhatsApp have more than quadrupled. So much traffic and stress on internet networks has slowed the speed of downloading web pages and apps, according to Ookla. “Congestion is higher,” said Adriane Blum, an Ookla spokeswoman. “We’re all at home, and the activities we’re doing in this unprecedented time are not low-bandwidth usage, which means a lot of activity on a network.” Cisco said demand for its WebEx teleconference service had tracked the spread of the coronavirus. Demand first surged in Asia, then in Europe, and last week it soared 240 percent in the United States. The demand has pushed up failure rates delivering video conferencing, said Sri Srinivasan, a Cisco senior vice president in charge of WebEx. “I don’t know if we’ll soon see a peak, not for weeks to come,” he said. “The reason I say that is because we aren’t seeing traffic in Asia slow down even now.” Internet service providers said they could handle the deluge of traffic but were adding capacity. Verizon, Cox and AT&T said they were building more cell sites to strengthen mobile networks, increasing the number of fiber connections on their network backbones, and upgrading the routing and switching technology that lets devices talk to one another and share an internet connection. Orange, formerly France Télécom, has doubled its capacity inside undersea internet cables. In Italy, where home internet use is up 90 percent, Telecom Italia said its technicians continued to make repairs and add capacity. Vodafone, one of Europe’s largest networks operators, said it had increased its capacity 50 percent in recent weeks through a mix of software and the addition of more equipment in the field. “We’re seeing some signs of stress,” AT&T’s chief executive, Randall Stephenson, said in an interview on CNN on Sunday. “We’re having to go out and do some augmentation of networks, and so we’re sending our employees out there to get that done, but right now the network is performing quite well.” To prevent clogged networks, Europe has taken the most aggressive steps. Last week, Mr. Breton, the European Union commissioner, discussed reducing the bitstreams of videos with Reed Hastings, the chief executive of Netflix; Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Google; and Susan Wojcicki, the head of YouTube. The companies agreed, as did Amazon for its Prime Video streaming service and Twitch, its online gaming platform. Many of the companies then went further. On Tuesday, Netflix decided to switch its high-definition video streams in India, Australia and Latin America to slightly lower quality to reduce the traffic they create there by 25 percent, and YouTube said it would make all global streams standard definition. “We continue to work closely with governments and network operators around the globe to do our part to minimize stress on the system during this unprecedented situation,” YouTube said in a statement. Microsoft’s Xbox gaming business recently asked large gaming companies to release online updates of their games during off-peak hours while it helped focus on the critical internet needs of people involved in the coronavirus crisis, according to an Xbox email reviewed by The New York Times. Video game updates can require great amounts of bandwidth to download. Xbox asked the companies to release updates in a four-hour overnight window in North America, and only from Monday through Thursday. “Microsoft is actively monitoring performance and usage trends to ensure we’re optimizing service for our customers worldwide, and accommodating new growth and demand,” the company said. “At the same time, these are unprecedented times, and we’re also taking proactive steps to plan for these high-usage periods.” While U.S. regulators said they did not plan to follow Europe in asking for streaming and social media companies to degrade their services, they are taking other steps. Last week, the Federal Communications Commission granted Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile temporary access to more airwaves. “The F.C.C. has been coordinating closely with network operators to ensure those networks remain up and running,” Ajit Pai, the agency’s chairman, said in a statement. Telefónica’s Mr. Blanco, who has been living under a lockdown in Spain, said he expected the record traffic to last for some time. It may even become the new normal, he said. In Spain, internet use drops only at 8 p.m., when people across the country go to their windows to cheer health workers and others who are helping to manage the crisis. “Suddenly at 8 p.m. it goes down, then it goes back up,” Mr. Blanco said. “It’s a beautiful thing.” Cecilia Kang reported from Washington, Davey Alba from New York and Adam Satariano from London.

                "The last time I was unemployed was in the depths of the Great Recession. I had recently moved in with my girlfriend, who suddenly found herself with an out-of-work partner who rarely left the house. But she gave me some surprising advice: Play video games. I would have a lot of time on my hands, she said, and while I could and should certainly do other things — housework, exercise, searching for a job — I would mostly be stuck at home with limited resources. Without something to occupy my mind, I’d go crazy. She was right. Playing video games helped ease my mind, elevate my mood and possibly saved our relationship. This year we’ll celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary. So now I’m going to give the same advice to anyone who is now out of work, or otherwise kept at home: Play video games. And don’t feel bad about it. If you’re not a gamer, you might think of video games as simple time-wasters. But for those stuck mostly inside without work, killing time is a real problem. And in the world of big-budget console games, 10 to 15 hours is a fairly short experience. Some can take hundreds of hours to complete. There are online games designed to be played and replayed for thousands of hours. But games are more than just empty time-wasters. In periods of pain, boredom or personal emptiness, video games can serve as palliative care for both the body and the mind. Think of gaming as a personal stimulus plan for a nation of unexpected shut-ins: It’s not a long-term solution, it won’t work for everyone, and it won’t solve the underlying problems — but it can provide limited, temporary relief for some. Video games take many forms, but they are all essentially simulations. And when the real world is temporarily unavailable, a simulated version might be what we need. Among other things, video games simulate work: Even the simplest games give players tasks, objectives, lists of things they have to do, problems to solve and a sense of accomplishment upon completion. And the biggest modern games offer seemingly endless lists of quests and objectives, tasks and subtasks, systems to learn and skills to be mastered. A game like the online shooter Destiny 2 offers hundreds, if not thousands, of hours of play, exploration and study. Set in an intricately designed sci-fi world, it tasks players with taking out wave after wave of alien enemies. It also rewards them for understanding a complex character progression system that involves completing ever-more-difficult goals and objectives, sometimes multiple times, in exchange for rarer and more powerful weapons and armor. You might not actually accomplish anything after a day spent checking off quests and gathering virtual materials, but you’ll feel like you did. Game critics have noted the worklike nature of many modern games for years, not always favorably. But in a world of stay-at-home mass unemployment, even the illusion of accomplishment is probably better than none at all. Indeed, the particular shut-in nature of our current crisis makes video games unusually relevant in a different way: What video games do better than any other medium is simulate places. Open-world games like Skyrim, Red Dead Redemption II or The Witcher 3 are built around giant, explorable spaces, sometimes the virtual equivalent of hundreds of square miles, with elaborate geography and shifting weather. They can take days or weeks to fully explore and at their best can be unexpectedly beautiful, offering the opportunity to encounter animated versions of sun-dappled vistas or foggy mountain peaks, to wander through crowded city streets or stroll past others on well-trod footpaths. Games can give us someplace else to go. That makes games useful in another way. Some of us are shut in alone. But especially in cities, many are now effectively trapped inside modest apartments with family or roommates, and little private space. Games offer a form of personal escape, a way to simulate being elsewhere from the confines of your couch. And for those who are alone, games can also serve as social spaces, virtual fields of play for cooperative adventures or competitive contests. Many of today’s most popular games are online experiences that allow players to engage with friends as well as strangers, to forge digital versions of the same sort of bonds with teammates that can develop in the real world. If you’re new at this, the cost of entry is fairly low: There are thousands of high-quality games available for phones, and many more available to download directly to your computer. Even better, many big-budget games are free if you have a computer or game console on which to play them. Late last year, Destiny 2, released in 2017 as a full-priced game, reinvented itself as a free-to-play experience, with the base game available at no cost (players can pay for expansions). Several of the “battle royale” games that have defined the new wave of first-person shooters are also free: A relatively well-reviewed recent entry, Call of Duty: Warzone, offers several clever twists on the popular last-player-standing formula. Not everyone wants to play online shooters, but for those willing to spend a little there are now subscription services that offer access to a large library of games for an annual or monthly fee. For little more than the price of a standard Netflix plan, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate offers access to dozens of games, from moody, philosophical puzzle games like The Talos Principle to richly animated platformers like Ori and the Will of the Wisps. There are sports games, strategy games, role-playing games and simple twitchy diversions that recall the arcade games I pumped quarters into as a kid. And for those who not satisfied with our current quasi-apocalypse, there even games about viral outbreaks and attacks, from the strategic epidemic simulator Plague Inc., to the deftly scripted post-pandemic action game The Last of Us, to The Division 2, a military thriller set in emptied-out recreations of downtown Washington and New York after a viral bioweapon wipes out most of the population. Maybe that one hits a little too close to home. Yes, games are frivolous. Yes, they are escapist. But the longer the coronavirus keeps social life and culture in isolation, the more we’ll need frivolity and escapism. There’s a limit, of course, to what video games can do: They can’t serve as long-term substitutes for real places, real work or real human interaction. But they can give us a simulacrum of all those things at a time when the real ones are in short supply, and tide us over until the world we actually need returns.

                "Like many young hipsters in Austin, Tex., Michael Burns wanted to make it big in some creative field -- perhaps writing comedy scripts in Hollywood. Instead, he wound up in a dead-end job, managing a call center. To kill time, he made friends with a group of equally clever and bored young men at the company where he worked, and they'd sit around talking about their shared passion: video games. Their favorite title was Halo, a best-selling Xbox game in which players control armor-clad soldiers as they wander through gorgeous coastal forests and grim military bunkers and fight an army of lizardlike aliens. Burns and his gang especially loved the \"team versus team\" mode, which is like a digital version of paint ball: instead of fighting aliens, players hook their Xboxes to the Internet, then log on together in a single game, at which point they assemble into two teams -- red-armored soldiers versus blue-armored ones. Instead of shooting aliens, they try to slaughter one another, using grenades, machine guns and death rays. On evenings and weekends, Burns and his friends would cluster around their TV's until the wee hours of the morning, gleefully blowing one another to pieces. \"Halo is like crack,\" Burns recalls thinking. \"I could play it until I die.\" Whenever a friend discovered a particularly cool stunt inside Halo -- for example, obliterating an enemy with a new type of grenade toss -- Burns would record a video of the stunt for posterity. (His friend would perform the move after Burns had run a video cord from his TV to his computer, so he could save it onto his hard drive.) Then he'd post the video on a Web site to show other gamers how the trick was done. To make the videos funnier, sometimes Burns would pull out a microphone and record a comedic voice-over, using video-editing software to make it appear as if the helmeted soldier himself were doing the talking. Then one day he realized that the videos he was making were essentially computer-animated movies, almost like miniature emulations of \"Finding Nemo\" or \"The Incredibles.\" He was using the game to function like a personal Pixar studio. He wondered: Could he use it to create an actual movie or TV series? Burns's group decided to give it a shot. They gathered around the Xbox at Burns's apartment, manipulating their soldiers like tiny virtual actors, bobbing their heads to look as if they were deep in conversation. Burns wrote sharp, sardonic scripts for them to perform. He created a comedy series called \"Red vs. Blue,\" a sort of sci-fi version of \"M*A*S*H.\" In \"Red vs. Blue,\" the soldiers rarely do any fighting; they just stand around insulting one another and musing over the absurdities of war, sounding less like patriotic warriors than like bored, clever video-store clerks. The first 10-minute episode opened with a scene set in Halo's bleakest desert canyon. Two red soldiers stood on their base, peering at two blue soldiers far off in the distance, and traded quips that sounded almost like a slacker disquisition on Iraq: Red Soldier: \"Why are we out here? Far as I can tell, it's just a box canyon in the middle of nowhere, with no way in or out. And the only reason we set up a red base here is because they have a blue base there. And the only reason they have a blue base over there is because we have a red base here.\" When they were done, they posted the episode on their Web site (surreptitiously hosted on computers at work). They figured maybe a few hundred people would see it and get a chuckle or two. Instead, \"Red vs. Blue\" became an instant runaway hit on geek blogs, and within a single day, 20,000 people stampeded to the Web site to download the file. The avalanche of traffic crashed the company server. \"My boss came into the office and was like, 'What the hell is going on?' \" Burns recalls. \"I looked over at the server, and it was going blink, blink, blink.\" Thrilled, Burns and his crew quickly cranked out another video, then another. They kept up a weekly production schedule, and after a few months, \"Red vs. Blue\" had, like some dystopian version of \"Friends,\" become a piece of appointment viewing. Nearly a million people were downloading each episode every Friday, writing mash notes to the creators and asking if they could buy a DVD of the collected episodes. Mainstream media picked up on the phenomenon. The Village Voice described it as \" 'Clerks' meets 'Star Wars,' \" and the BBC called it \"riotously funny\" and said it was \"reminiscent of the anarchic energy of 'South Park.' \" Burns realized something strange was going on. He and his crew had created a hit comedy show -- entirely inside a video game. Video games have not enjoyed good publicity lately. Hillary Clinton has been denouncing the violence in titles like Grand Theft Auto, which was yanked out of many stores last month amid news that players had unlocked sex scenes hidden inside. Yet when they're not bemoaning the virtual bloodshed, cultural pundits grudgingly admit that today's games have become impressively cinematic. It's not merely that the graphics are so good: the camera angles inside the games borrow literally from the visual language of film. When you're playing Halo and look up at the sun, you'll see a little \"lens flare,\" as if you were viewing the whole experience through the eyepiece of a 16-millimeter Arriflex. By using the game to actually make cinema, Burns and his crew flipped a switch that neatly closed a self-referential media loop: movies begat games that begat movies. And Burns and his crew aren't alone. Video-game aficionados have been creating \"machinima\" -- an ungainly term mixing \"machine\" and \"cinema\" and pronounced ma-SHEEN-i-ma -- since the late 90's. \"Red vs. Blue\" is the first to break out of the underground, and now corporations like Volvo are hiring machinima artists to make short promotional films, while MTV, Spike TV and the Independent Film Channel are running comedy shorts and music videos produced inside games. By last spring, Burns and his friends were making so much money from \"Red vs. Blue\" that they left their jobs and founded Rooster Teeth Productions. Now they produce machinima full time. It may be the most unlikely form of indie filmmaking yet -- and one of the most weirdly democratic. \"It's like 'The Blair Witch Project' all over again, except you don't even need a camera,\" says Julie Kanarowski, a product manager with Electronic Arts, the nation's largest video-game publisher. \"You don't even need actors.\" Back in college, Burns and another Rooster Teeth founder, Matt Hullum, wrote and produced a traditional live-action indie movie. It cost $9,000, required a full year to make and was seen by virtually no one. By contrast, the four Xboxes needed to make \"Red vs. Blue\" cost a mere $600. Each 10-minute episode requires a single day to perform and edit and is viewed by hordes of feverish video-game fans the planet over. More than just a cheap way to make an animated movie, machinima allows game players to comment directly on the pop culture they so devotedly consume. Much like \"fan fiction\" (homespun tales featuring popular TV characters) or \"mash-ups\" (music fans blending two songs to create a new hybrid), machinima is a fan-created art form. It's what you get when gamers stop blasting aliens for a second and start messing with the narrative. And God knows, there's plenty to mess with. These days, the worlds inside games are so huge and open-ended that gamers can roam anywhere they wish. Indeed, players often abandon the official goal of the game -- save the princess; vanquish the eldritch forces of evil -- in favor of merely using the virtual environment as a gigantic jungle gym. In one popular piece of Halo machinima, \"Warthog Jump,\" a player cunningly used the game to conduct a series of dazzling physics experiments. He placed grenades in precise locations beneath jeeps and troops, such that when the targets blew sky-high, they pinwheeled through the air in precise formations, like synchronized divers. Another gamer recorded a machinima movie that poked subversive fun at Grand Theft Auto. Instead of playing as a dangerous, cop-killing gangster, the player pretended he was a naïve Canadian tourist -- putting down his gun, dressing in tacky clothes and simply wandering around the game's downtown environment for hours, admiring the scenery. So what's it like to actually shoot a movie inside a game? In June, I visited the Rooster Teeth offices in Buda, Tex., a tiny Austin suburb, to observe Burns and his group as they produced a scene of \"Red vs. Blue.\" Burns, a tall, burly 32-year-old, sat in front of two huge flat-panel screens, preparing the editing software. Nearby were the two Rooster Teeth producers who would be acting on-screen: Geoff Ramsey, a scraggly-bearded 30-year-old whose arms are completely covered in tattoos of fish and skulls, and Gustavo Sorola, a gangly 27-year-old who sprawled in a beanbag chair and peered through his thick architect glasses at the day's e-mail. They were fan letters, Sorola told me, that pour in from teenagers who are as enthusiastic as they are incoherent. \"The way kids write these days,\" he said with a grimace. \"It's like someone threw up on the keyboard.\" In the script they were acting out that day, a pair of \"Red vs. Blue\" soldiers engaged in one of their typically pointless existential arguments, bickering over whether it's possible to kill someone with a toy replica of a real weapon. The Rooster Teeth crew recorded the voice-overs earlier in the day; now they were going to create the animation for the scene. Burns picked up a controller and booted up Halo on an Xbox. He would act as the camera: whatever his character saw would be recorded, from his point of view. Then Sorola and Ramsey logged into the game, teleporting in as an orange-suited and a red-suited soldier. Burns posed them near a massive concrete bunker and frowned as he scrutinized the view on the computer screen. \"Hmmmm,\" he muttered. \"We need something to frame you guys -- some sort of prop.\" He ran his character over to a nearby alien hovercraft, jumped in and parked it next to the actors. \"Sweet!\" he said. \"I like it!\" In a \"Red vs. Blue\" shoot, the actors all must follow one important rule: Be careful not to accidentally kill another actor. \"Sometimes you'll drop your controller and it unintentionally launches a grenade. It takes, like, 20 minutes for the blood splatters to dry up,\" Ramsey said. \"Totally ruins the scene.\" Finally, Burns was ready to go. He shouted, \"Action!\" and the voice-overs began playing over loudspeakers. Sorola and Ramsey acted in time with the dialogue. Acting, in this context, was weirdly minimalist. They mashed the controller joysticks with their thumbs, bobbing the soldiers' heads back and forth roughly in time with important words in each line. \"It's puppetry, basically,\" Ramsey said, as he jiggled his controller. Of all the \"Red vs. Blue\" crew members, Ramsey is renowned for his dexterity with an Xbox. When a scene calls for more than five actors onstage, he'll put another controller on the ground and manipulate it with his right foot, allowing him to perform as two characters simultaneously. As I watched, I was reminded of what initially cracked me up so much about \"Red vs. Blue\": the idea that faceless, anonymous soldiers in a video game have interior lives. It's a \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern\" conceit; \"Red vs. Blue\" is what the game characters talk about when we're not around to play with them. As it turns out, they're a bunch of neurotics straight out of \"Seinfeld.\" One recruit reveals that he chain-smokes inside his airtight armor; a sergeant tells a soldier his battle instructions are to \"scream like a woman.\" And, in a sardonic gloss on the game's endless carnage, none of the soldiers have the vaguest clue why they're fighting. Yet as I discovered, real-life soldiers are among the most ardent fans of \"Red vs. Blue.\" When I walked around the Rooster Teeth office, I found it was festooned with letters, plaques and an enormous American flag, gifts from grateful American troops, many of whom are currently stationed in Iraq. Isn't it a little astonishing, I asked Burns when the crew went out in the baking Texas sun for a break, that actual soldiers are so enamored of a show that portrays troops as inept cowards, leaders as cynical sociopaths and war itself as a supremely meaningless endeavor? Burns laughed, but said the appeal was nothing sinister. \" 'Red vs. Blue' is about downtime,\" he said. \"There's very little action, which is precisely the way things are in real life.\" \"He's right,\" Ramsey added. He himself spent five years in the army after high school. \"We'd just sit around digging ditches and threatening to kill each other all day long,\" he said. \"We were bored out of our minds.\" Perhaps the most unusual thing about machinima is that none of its creators are in jail. After all, they're gleefully plundering intellectual property at a time when the copyright wars have become particularly vicious. Yet video-game companies have been upbeat -- even exuberant -- about the legions of teenagers and artists pillaging their games. This is particularly bewildering in the case of \"Red vs. Blue,\" because Halo is made by Bungie, a subsidiary of Microsoft, a company no stranger to using a courtroom to defend its goods. What the heck is going on? As it turns out, people at Bungie love \"Red vs. Blue.\" \"We thought it was kind of brilliant,\" says Brian Jarrard, the Bungie staff member who manages interactions with fans. \"There are people out there who would never have heard about Halo without 'Red vs. Blue.' It's getting an audience outside the hardcore gaming crowd.\" Sure, Rooster Teeth ripped off Microsoft's intellectual property. But Microsoft got something in return: \"Red vs. Blue\" gave the game a whiff of countercultural coolness, the sort of grass-roots street cred that major corporations desperately crave but can never manufacture. After talking with Rooster Teeth, Microsoft agreed, remarkably, to let them use the game without paying any licensing fees at all. In fact, the company later hired Rooster Teeth to produce \"Red vs. Blue\" videos to play as advertisements in game stores. Microsoft has been so strangely solicitous that when it was developing the sequel to Halo last year, the designers actually inserted a special command -- a joystick button that makes a soldier lower his weapon -- designed solely to make it easier for Rooster Teeth to do dialogue. \"If you're playing the game, there's no reason to lower your weapon at all,\" Burns explained. \"They put that in literally just so we can shoot machinima.\" Other game companies have gone even further. Many now include editing software with their games, specifically to encourage fans to shoot movies. When Valve software released its hit game Half-Life 2 last year, it included \"Faceposer\" software so that machinima creators could tweak the facial expressions of characters. When the Sims 2 -- a sequel to the top-selling game of all time -- came out last year, its publisher, Electronic Arts, set up a Web site so that fans could upload their Sims 2 movies to show to the world. (About 8,000 people so far have done so.) Still, it's one thing for gamers to produce a jokey comedy or a music video. Can machinima actually produce a work of art -- something with serious emotional depth? A few people have tried. In China, a visual artist named Feng Mengbo used the first-person-shooter game Quake III to produce Q4U, in which the screen is filled with multiple versions of himself, killing one another. Players' relationships with constant, blood-splattering violence is a common subject in game art. Last year, the 31-year-old artist Brody Condon produced an unsettling film that consisted of nothing but shots of himself committing suicide inside 50 different video games. \"I try to come to terms with what taking your life means in these games,\" Condon says. \"I'm trying to understand, spiritually, your relationship with an avatar on the screen.\" But even machinima's biggest fans admit that the vast majority of machinima is pretty amateurish. \"It's like if some friends of mine all broke into a movie set, and we all got to use all the cameras and special-effects equipment,\" says Carl Goodman, director of digital media at the American Museum of the Moving Image, which began to hold an annual machinima festival two years ago. \"We wouldn't quite know how to use it, but we'd make some pretty interesting stuff.\" Yet as Goodman points out, there's a competing proposition. Machinima does not always strive to emulate \"realistic,\" artistic movies. On the contrary, it is often explicitly devoted to celebrating the aesthetics of games -- the animations and in-jokes, the precise physics. Most machinima is probably meaningless to people who don't play games, much as ESPN is opaque to anyone who doesn't watch sports. But for those who do play Halo, it was genuinely thrilling to see something like \"Warthog Jump,\" with its meticulously synchronized explosions. The Rooster Teeth crew has its own hilariously stringent rule for making machinima: no cheating. When they shoot \"Red vs. Blue,\" they do not use any special effects that are not organically included in the game; everything you see in an episode of \"Red vs. Blue\" could in theory have taken place during an actual game of Halo, played by a fan in his bedroom. It's a charmingly purist attitude, a sci-fi version of the \"Dogma\" school of indie film, which argues that movies are best when cinematic trickery is kept to a minimum. One evening in New York, I visited with Ethan Vogt as he and his machinima team shot a car-chase scene for a Volvo promo. Vogt and two producers sat at computers, logged into a multiplayer game; each producer controlled a car racing through crowded city streets, while Vogt controlled a free-floating \"camera\" that followed behind, recording the visuals. The vehicles -- an enormous 1972 Chevy Impala and a Volvo V50 -- screamed along at about 60 miles an hour, fishtailing through corners while plowing into mailboxes, lampposts and, occasionally, clots of pedestrians. The lead car burst into flames. \"That's great,\" Vogt said. \"That's great.\" Though it shares with independent filmmaking a do-it-yourself aesthetic, machinima inverts the central tradition of indie film: smallness. With their skimpy budgets, indie directors tend to set movies in kitchens or living rooms -- and focus instead on providing quality acting and scripts. Machinima, in contrast, often has horribly cheesy acting and ham-fisted, purple-prose stories -- but they're set in outer space. Want massive shootouts? Howling mob scenes? Roman gladiatorial armies clashing by night? No problem. It is the rare form of amateur film in which the directors aspire to be not Wes Anderson but George Lucas. Indeed, with video games played on computers, it is now possible to build an entire world from scratch. The core of any video game is its game engine, the software that knows how to render 3-D objects and how to realistically represent the physics of how they move, bounce or collide. But the actual objects inside the game -- the people, the cars, the guns, even the buildings -- can be altered, tweaked or replaced by modifications, or \"mods.\" Mods do not require any deep programming skills; indeed, almost any teenager with a passing acquaintance in graphic-design software can \"re-skin\" a character in a game to make it look like himself, for instance. (Xbox and PlayStation games, in comparison, are much harder to mod, because the consoles are locked boxes, designed to prevent players from tampering with the games.) I was able to see modding in action one night when I visited the ILL Clan, a pioneering machinima group. Their headquarters are the kitchen table in the cramped one-bedroom Brooklyn apartment of Frank Dellario; a lanky, hyperkinetic 42-year-old, he sat on a rickety folding chair, pecking at a keyboard. The table was littered with four computer screens and laptops, the remnants of take-out sushi and a hopelessly tangled morass of computer cords and joysticks; a huge wide-screen TV lurked behind them for viewing their work. On the night I visited, they were using a game engine called Torque to shoot a short heist movie for Audi, in which two thugs beat up a concert violinist and make off with an antique violin in a van. To quickly create a gritty-looking city, Dellario and his colleague -- ILL Clan's co-founder, Matt Dominianni -- hired a local artist to build a generic-looking urban intersection inside the game. To customize it, Dominianni went onto Google, found snapshots of a few seedy stores (an adult bookstore, a tattoo parlor and a furniture outlet) and digitally pasted them onto the front of the buildings. Then they went to a site called Turbo-Squid, a sort of Amazon for virtual in-game items, and for $45 bought a van that could be plunked down inside the game. When I arrived, they were browsing the site and contemplating buying a few women. \"My God, look at this one,\" Dellario marveled, as he clicked open a picture of an eerily realistic 3-D brunette named Masha. \"I'm going to marry this woman. They've finally broken through to total reality.\" Dellario put the van into the correct location in the scene, then logged into the game to figure out the camera angle for this shot. He frowned. It didn't look right. The lighting was all off, with shadows falling in the wrong places. Dominianni figured out the problem: \"The sun is supposed to be at high noon. It's in the wrong place.\" \"Oh, yeah,\" Dellario said. \"Let me move it.\" He pulled up a menu, clicked on the \"sun\" command, and dragged it across the sky. Now they were finally ready to shoot. Dellario realized they needed an extra pair of hands to manipulate one of the thugs. \"Want to act in this scene?\" Dellario asked, and he handed me a joystick. I sat down at one of the computers and took control of \"Thug1,\" a brown-haired man in a golf shirt and brown pants, carrying the stolen violin. Dominianni was playing \"Thug2.\" Our characters were supposed to look around to make sure the coast is clear, then jump in the truck and race off. Dellario gave me my motivation: \"It's like you hear a suspicious noise. You're nervous.\" I used the joystick to practice moving my virtual character, craning its neck -- my neck? -- back and forth. I have played plenty of video games, but this felt awfully odd. Usually when I am inside a game, I'm just worried about staying alive while the bullets whiz past my ears. I've never had to emote. While Dellario and Dominianni fiddled with the camera angle, I grew impatient and wandered around, exploring the virtual set. I peered in a few shop windows -- they were strikingly photorealistic, even up close. Then I walked down an alley and suddenly arrived at the end of the set. It was like a tiny Western town in the desert: once you got beyond the few clustered buildings, there was nothing there -- just a vast, enormous plain, utterly empty and stretching off infinitely into the distance. This spring, electronic arts decided to promote the Sims 2 by hiring Rooster Teeth to create a machinima show using the game. Called \"The Strangerhood,\" it would be freely available online. \"The Strangerhood\" is a parody of reality TV: a group of people wake up one day to discover that they are living in new houses, and they can't remember who they are or how they got there. In the Sims 2, the animated people are impressively Pixar-like and expressive, making \"The Strangerhood\" even more like a mainstream animated show than \"Red vs. Blue\"; you could almost imagine watching it on Saturday morning. The problem is, the Sims 2 has turned out to be incredibly difficult to shoot with. When the Rooster Teeth gang uses Halo for machinima, the characters are mere puppets and can be posed any way the creators want. But in the Sims 2, the little virtual characters have artificial intelligence and free will. When you're playing, you do not control all the action: the fun is in putting your Sims in interesting social situations, then standing back and watching what they'll do. When Rooster Teeth's Matt Hullum builds a virtual set and puts the \"Strangerhood\" characters in place for a shoot, he's never quite sure what will happen. To shoot a scene in which two men wake up in bed together, Hullum had to spend hours playing with the two characters -- who are nominally heterosexual -- forcing them into repeated conversations until they eventually became such good friends they were willing to share a bed. Shooting machinima with Sims is thus maddeningly like using actual, human stars: they're stubborn; they stage hissy fits and stomp off to their trailers. \"We'll do three or four takes of a scene, and one of the Sims will start getting tired and want to go to sleep,\" Hullum said. \"It's just like being on a real set. You're screaming: 'Quick, quick, get the shot! We're losing light!' \" Hullum showed me a typical \"Strangerhood\" scene. He put Nikki, a young ponytailed brunette in a baseball cap, in the kitchen to interact with Wade, a slacker who looked eerily like a digital Owen Wilson. (To give Wade a mellow, San Francisco vibe, Hullum programmed him to move at a pace 50 percent slower than the other characters.) Hullum pointed to Nikki's \"mood\" bar; it was low, which meant she was in a bad mood and wouldn't want to talk. \"When they're bored, you have to lock them in a room alone for a few hours until they start to crave conversation,\" Hullum said. He tried anyway, prodding Wade to approach her and talk about food, one of Nikki's favorite subjects. It worked. The two became engrossed in a conversation, laughing and gesticulating wildly. \"See, this footage would be great if we were shooting a scene where these guys are maybe gossiping,\" Hullum mused, as he zoomed the camera in to frame a close-up on Wade. Then Nikki started to yawn. \"Oh, damn. See -- she's getting bored. Oh, no, she's walking away,\" Hullum said, as the little virtual Nikki wandered out of the room. \"Damn. You see what we have to deal with?\" The audience for \"The Strangerhood\" has not exploded the way \"Red vs. Blue\" did. The project is a gamble: its creators hope it will break out of machinima's geeky subculture and vault into the mainstream. Though in a way, Hullum said, the mainstream isn't always a fun place to be, either. Before he returned to Austin to work on \"Red vs. Blue,\" he spent six miserable years in Hollywood working on second-rate teen movies with big budgets, like \"Scooby-Doo\" and \"The Faculty.\" \"So now to come to this, where we have total creative control of our own stuff, it's amazing,\" Hullum said, as he watched Nikki walk out of the house in search of a more interesting conversation. \"I just pray we can keep this going. Because if we can't, I'm in big trouble.\" Clive Thompson is a contributing writer for the magazine."

                "SYNTHETIC WORLDS The Business and Culture of Online Games. By Edward Castronova. 332 pp. University of Chicago Press. $29. SMARTBOMB The Quest for Art, Entertainment and Big Bucks in the Videogame Revolution. By Heather Chaplin and Aaron Ruby. 287 pp. Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill. $24.95. Here's a theory that may be neither original nor empirically defensible but feels true: The more fun an activity is, the less interesting it is to read about. War producces great journalism; water-skiing does not. Can you guess where video games fall on this spectrum? In the last few years, a great many words have been expended to report on this flourishing cultural phenomenon. Most accounts begin with a hyperactive presentation of statistics, which we will not rehearse here. This is all you need to know (and perhaps already do): Video games have grown into a huge business, outpacing the movie industry and bulldozing childhood as we knew it. We adults are not safe, either. Whether they admit it or not, you probably have friends who can be found awake at 2 a.m. disemboweling orcs, foiling terrorist plots and scooping up fumbles and running them into end zones. It is the opinion of Edward Castronova, author of \"Synthetic Worlds,\" that such electronic experiences are not merely a hedge against boredom but a profound indicator of where the entire world is heading. Online, off-line; reality, fantasy -- these distinctions will cease to matter as more and more of us pass our time in virtual environments. Economies will evolve as we pay real money for virtual goods and vice versa. Conflicts that begin online will spill into the real world and back. Laws will be written to protect our newfound interests. Castronova's vision has elements of both utopia and dystopia. But mostly he is bullish. Life in these alternative zones may eventually become so fulfilling, he contends, \"that a fairly substantial exodus may loom in the distance.\" He means this, really. Like the Irish and Italians who left their native lands in the late 19th century to come to America, gamers could create a genuine human migration, away from the real and into the virtual. What will be real then? The specific object of Castronova's scholarship is Mmorpgs, the inelegant acronym for \"massively multiplayer online role-playing games,\" which can involve hundreds of thousands of players plugging in from all over the world. A disproportionate number of these games revolve around dwarfs, wizards, quests and magic lands, though the content is becoming ever more diverse. These days, there's a Mmorpg out there to suit the interests of just about anybody. One game, The Sims Online, merely simulates suburban life, and it is madly popular. Castronova is an economist who teaches telecommunications at Indiana University, and among academic economists he is a bold contrarian, if only because he dares to take computer games seriously. My oh my does he take them seriously. In dense, lifeless prose, he sledgehammers away at his major themes, constantly pausing to review the material he's just covered and preview what is to come. His sweeping conclusions are intriguing -- get ready for governments sending agents into virtual worlds and waging war with avatars! -- but he's not a vivid enough writer to animate most of his futuristic abstractions. In \"Smartbomb,\" Heather Chaplin and Aaron Ruby try harder to entertain. They've organized their history of video games as a study of ambitious individuals, breaking it down into a series of breezy, magazinelike profiles of uneven quality. A lot of the original reporting seems to take place at gaming conventions, which is not where one imagines the really interesting stuff happens. But the stories are pretty good, even when they don't break new ground. Rereading the legend of Nolan Bushnell and the founding of Atari is like hearing a bar band play a spirited \"Twist and Shout\" -- enjoyable, but no additional points for Degree of Difficulty. In two spots, though, Chaplin and Ruby really score. In their chapter on Mmorpgs, they sensitively profile David Reber, a 30-year-old Californian who spends every free moment chained to his computer, acting out a series of intense fantasy existences that provide him with the companionship and sense of achievement missing in his real life. Just as Castronova would predict, Reber withdraws from the real world as his fantasy life deepens -- he has lapses at work and when Chaplin and Ruby last check in with him, he's moved back in with his mother. The other winning portrait in \"Smartbomb\" is of Will Wright, the creator of SimCity, as well as its offshoot The Sims, and a new simulation called Spore in which players guide a new creature from its biological origin onward. In an industry that mimics Hollywood's craven predilection for cheap, gory theatrics, Wright stands apart as a humble philosopher in love with the potential of games to expand the human experience. Though Chaplin and Ruby don't have much to say themselves about the significance of video games, they wisely hand matters over to Wright, who foresees a future that might just keep us all staying up past 2 a.m. \"I think one thing that's unique about video games is not only that they can respond to you but down the road they'll be able to adapt themselves to you. They'll learn your desires,\" he says. \"It might just be that games become deeply personal artifacts -- more like dreams.\" Video Game Books Hugo Lindgren is the editorial director of New York Magazine."

                "THE great thing about shopping for video games is that the person you're buying the gift for almost certainly knows more about it than you do. If you have gamers in your life, no matter what age, odds are that they already know exactly what they want. You need only shut up and fork over the credit card. You can use this to your advantage. If you are lucky enough that the gamer on your list has said anything recently about a game or game machine that is not Microsoft's new Xbox 360, the smart move is to drop whatever you're doing right now and buy it. That way, you will not be among the hordes this holiday season already wondering if they can afford to miss a car payment, or maybe a mortgage installment, to satisfy their 360-craving gamer. That is because the 360, with its snazzy graphics and slick online interface, has emerged as the It gift of the 2005 holiday season. Theoretically, the 360 is supposed to cost $300 for a basic unit and $400 for the deluxe version. In reality, the console is sold out across the country and is now fetching $1,000 or so on eBay. And that's before you buy any games, which run up to $60 each. So if your favorite gamer is interested in anything else this year, consider yourself fortunate. Thankfully, forgoing the 360 doesn't mean returning to the Stone Age of, say, Pong. There are still excellent games being made for the current generation of home game consoles -- Sony's PlayStation 2, Nintendo's GameCube, and the original Xbox, which each cost less than $200 -- and Sony's $250 PSP headlines the strong current crop of hand-held units. Moreover, if you have a powerful PC, that may still be your most capable game machine. In any case, both Sony and Nintendo have new game consoles on the way next year. And availability of the 360 is sure to improve in early 2006. There is a chance that Microsoft could show up with a \"surprise\" boatload of additional 360's in the next few weeks. (The word from the company is that it is working as hard as it can to get units to retailers.) Unless you're willing to pay the prices on eBay or other auction sites, the best advice to shoppers who absolutely must have a 360 is to get themselves on waiting lists at as many retailers and Web sites as possible. So those folks you saw camped out on sidewalks before the 360 went on sale on Nov. 22 don't look so silly now, right? Waiting in line for a midnight sale at a Wal-Mart in Moline, Ill., Kara Harvell told The Quad-City Times that she wanted to buy the console for her five sons. Deliciously, the newspaper reported that Ms. Harvell, a nursing school student, \"got out of class by telling her professor that her son wasn't feeling well at school.\" Of course, some people don't like waiting in line. In the (very) few days before the machine sold out, scattered reports emerged of shoppers being held up for their 360's as they left stores. Please don't go robbing anyone. But if you've already gone through the effort of finding a 360 at its regular price, it is certainly worth the extra $100 for the higher-end model. The full version comes with a headset (for making free phone calls over the Internet to other Xbox users), a wireless controller (instead of a wired model) and a hard drive, which you need to play games made for the original Xbox. Top-line games are $50 to $60. The unit comes with a free basic membership to Microsoft's online game service, which lets you talk to other online 360 users and compare scores. But if you want to actually play head-to-head live over the Internet, you need to buy the \"gold\" membership, which costs $8 a month or $50 a year. In addition to playing games with eye-popping graphics, the machine plays DVD's and can display photos from your digital camera on your regular or high-definition television. Luckily, the 360 is not the only game system potentially worth buying this holiday season. There are cheaper and more readily available options, too. Besides the Xbox 360, the other major new game machine is Sony's PSP hand-held. The sleek black unit has a clear, colorful screen that is far more vibrant than one would expect from a hand-held device, and that may be why people on buses and trains seem to be using their PSP's to watch movies as much as playing games. Dozens of movies are now being released on the small UMD data discs that slip into the back of the PSP, which inexplicably comes with white headphones reminiscent of those supplied with Apple's iPods. Over all, the games for the PSP have been lackluster so far, but that trend shows signs of changing. Aimed at adults, the new Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories takes advantage of the PSP's built-in wireless capability to allow multiple PSP users to battle one another through the game's streets and alleys, even as the players themselves are on the go. Next year, a new installment of the quirky family-friendly Japanese game Katamari Damacy is expected for the PSP. Even cheaper and smaller than the PSP is Nintendo's DS hand-held, which costs about $130. Nintendo has long been popular with young gamers, but the new Nintendogs pet simulator is finding fans among both children and adult women. The screens on the DS, which stands for dual screen, are not quite as impressive as the PSP's, but are still clear enough for enjoyable gaming. But rather than play on the go, many people still prefer their video games on the television in the den. With all of the hype around the 360 it is easy to overlook that you can now buy the original Xbox or Sony's PlayStation 2 each for around $150. Bundles that include a console and a few games can be found under $300 on the Web. Nintendo's GameCube console now costs only around $100. Of course, the Xbox, GameCube and PS2 certainly don't have the cachet of the new 360. And most serious gamers already have one, two or even all three of the older systems. But if you are looking for a cost-effective way to introduce a young person to gaming, buying any of the older systems is a smart move. In fact, many serious gamers would argue that the games being made now for those mature machines are actually better than those for the 360, which is still so new that developers have not yet figured out how to fully harness its power. The older games just don't look quite as snazzy. But until Sony's PlayStation 3 and Nintendo's Revolution are released next year, the Xbox 360 is clearly the best gaming machine around (unless you want to consider a top-notch gaming PC, which could easily cost more than $2,000). If someone you know wants a 360 and you can't find it at a reasonable price, perhaps fend them off with a PSP or a gift certificate that can be exchanged for some new games for an existing console. Then promise you'll get a 360, PlayStation 3 or Revolution next year. You may forget the promise, but they won't. Is It Live, or Is It A Video Game? THERE are about 20 games available for Microsoft's new Xbox 360. It does not have a single hit title yet, as Halo became for the original Xbox, and the lineup is still missing some genres, like role-playing games. Nonetheless, games out now do a good job of demonstrating how the next generation of consoles deliver visual and social experiences far more sophisticated than those possible on older consoles. The strongest two genres on the 360 are auto racing and first-person shooters. On the racetrack, Project Gotham Racing 3 lets you speed through detailed recreated cities like New York, Las Vegas and London. You can race in online leagues, compete against \"ghosts\" that simulate your friends' best performances or \"tune in\" and watch from the sidelines as some of the best virtual drivers in the world go wheel to wheel. The shooters put a player in the perspective of a person fighting, often with guns. Among the standouts are Perfect Dark Zero, set in the near future, and Call of Duty 2, a gritty re-creation of World War II. The most visually impressive 360 game is Kameo: Elements of Power, an action adventure that looks like child's play, with its evocation of a Pixar animated film, but is challenging at points. About half the games for the 360 mimic real-life sports. NBA 2K6, which at times could pass for a live telecast, is the most impressive of the bunch. Amped 3, a snowboarding simulator, is easy to play and gorgeous to watch. SETH SCHIESEL"

                "Tomorrow the Xbox, the new video-game console from Microsoft, arrives in stores on the heels of a $500 million marketing blitz. But it doesn't seem as if much of that money is going to the thousands of musicians who have provided the company with songs to use in the games that will be played on it. Though a band can typically make $10,000 to $20,000 when a song is included in a video game, Microsoft has been asking musicians to contribute their music to video games for pennies -- and in some cases no money at all, with no upfront fee and no royalties on the back end. Musicians, from small, independent punk bands to major-label artists, have been accepting this deal, hoping for the promotional boost that comes with being heard in a game that is played obsessively by teenagers across the country. Joining a band is not a lucrative career choice for most musicians. Many who are signed to major labels spend their careers in debt to those record companies, trying to earn back advances and expenses. But the increasing use of contemporary songs in movies, video games and advertisements has meant an unexpected windfall for lesser-known and midlevel artists. Microsoft, however, is changing that dynamic. ''I asked if we could get any money, and they just said no,'' said Larry Cooper, who runs Revelation Records, a punk, metal and hardcore label that has several songs on the soundtrack to Amped, a snowboarding game. ''I almost thought that out of principle, if there's no payment, we shouldn't do that kind of stuff. But I didn't want to snip out an opportunity for a band that might want to do that kind of promotion.'' Of the bands Mr. Cooper asked, all but one agreed to provide free music to Microsoft. ''I think they were just looking for cheap music, and that's why they called a lot of small labels,'' Mr. Cooper continued. ''I asked them who else was on the soundtrack and made some suggestions, but they said they wanted to stick with certain labels because they didn't have to pay for licensing.'' Brenner Adams, a product planner on Amped, said that on his game Microsoft was looking not for cheap music but for an opportunity to expose as many small underground bands as possible. Under Microsoft policy the interview with Mr. Adams was conducted with a company publicist on the line, taking notes on the conversation. ''We're not saying, 'Hey, we want to use your music for nothing,' '' Mr. Adams said. ''We said, 'Hey, we really want to promote these artists and promote who they are and what they stand for.' '' Though Microsoft didn't give any money to musicians on such independent labels, it did offer small amounts to bands on major labels. It made a deal with Virgin Records, obtaining songs from acts like the Gorillaz, Iggy Pop, the Chemical Brothers and Timbaland & Magoo by paying ''small fees and publishing,'' said Brad Fox, the director of artist development at Virgin. The amount of course remains a big contrast to the millions of dollars that Microsoft is believed to have paid to use Madonna's ''Ray of Light'' in its 60-second Windows XP advertisement. ''We're looking at this as a marketing exercise,'' Mr. Fox said. ''There's no way I could get 10 to 15 different artists in somebody's house in front of an active consumer audience for 20 hours a week. If I could get 20 percent of those kids to go buy a record, that's great.'' But the Xbox isn't like other systems, nor are these deals like other deals. Many record labels are operating on the faith that Microsoft will make efforts to promote their bands. Mr. Fox said he hoped that the Virgin artists used in the games would be mentioned in Xbox promotional material, game catalogs and game boxes. But a trip to the Xbox Web site showed that the artists on games like Amped were not mentioned on the box or promotional poster shown online, nor were the bands on any game highlighted in any special way on the Web site. Other promotional efforts, however, have been made: there was a link at the site to a radio station playing music from Amped, and at a recent Xbox promotional party in Los Angeles Microsoft gave away a CD with music from Amped. Mr. Adams noted that most of the cash deals were made with better-known bands that don't need the publicity as much. ''So,'' he said, ''why not turn the decision around, bring the smaller guys up and give them the promotion they can't get anywhere else?'' He said that music from some 240 artists was used on Amped, that in the game the names of the record labels are shown on banners and that players had the option of seeing names of the bands, songs and record labels. He added that the company hoped to stage more promotions with the music. But there is no guarantee that gamers will hear much if any of the music of these bands. That is because in a feature unique to the Xbox consumers have the option of wiping out the soundtrack to a game and replacing it with music from their own CD's. Originally music executives were less worried about artists not getting paid than about the potential for Xbox to become a new Napster, since it has a large hard drive and online capabilities. But in a statement prepared for this article Microsoft said that though music could be stored on the hard drive, it could not be copied on ''CD's, MP3's or any other devices.'' Other executives in the music publishing business now worry that video game manufacturers and even advertising agencies will follow Microsoft's lead and tell bands that in exchange for use of their music at no cost, an extra effort will be made to promote the groups in products and commercials. As it is, artists sacrifice a lot of money and time at the altar of promotion, taking on costly and inconvenient tasks gratis, like performing concerts promoted by radio stations. So, some wonder, in a field in which just about anything musicians do can be seen as raising their profiles, where is the line between promotional and paid work? Jeff Koz, the chief executive of SubZero, a company that brokers deals between advertisers and musicians, said, ''We believe that people should be paid for what they do.'' Mr. Koz has worked with Microsoft on music and sound design. He added, however, that there was a give-and-take between payment and promotion, and lesser-known artists were often given somewhat lower fees in exchange for what could be career-enhancing exposure. ''There's value to cross-promotion,'' he said, ''and we're not privy to how those Microsoft deals went down. Some of those bands might see it as a tremendous opportunity.'' No. 1 and Dropping The new Britney Spears album, ''Britney,'' will enter the pop charts next week at No. 1 with 769,000 copies sold, according to Soundscan, a company that tracks retail sales. The number, a significant drop from the first-week sales of her previous album (1.3 million), reflects a teenage pop demand that is slipping but still hanging on tenaciously as Ms. Spears sagely remakes her image so she has one foot in the teenage world and the other in the general pop market (an approach best summed up by her song title ''I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman''). The following week, record executives say, ''Britney'' seems likely to slip to No. 2 when the Garth Brooks album ''Scarecrow'' makes its debut with predicted sales of more than one million copies."

                "LOS ANGELES — Microsoft, seeking to expand offerings on its Xbox 360 console, has reached an agreement with a company headed by Peter Safran, the veteran Hollywood producer and talent manager, to produce original shows for distribution on the system. Through his Safran Co., he represents clients like the actor and producer Sean Combs (\"Monster's Ball\"), the actor and writer Nia Vardalos (\"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\") and the filmmakers Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer (\"Epic Movie\"). Safran founded the company in 2006 after leaving Brillstein-Grey Management. Speaking by telephone last week, Scott Nocas, global marketing manager for programming of the Xbox Live entertainment service, said he expected similar deals to follow. \"We definitely look at this as the first of many,\" said Nocas. In an interview at his office in Los Angeles last week, Safran said his first round of programs would be scripted and would probably run under 10 minutes. He said his initial focus would be on genres like comedy and horror that appeal to the Xbox 360 audience, which is heavily concentrated from the ages of 14 to 34, and tends to be more male than female. The first shows are expected to be available to viewers by autumn in the Northern Hemisphere. \"The Xbox is unique; it operates at a level outside of what we generally consider Web entertainment,\" Safran said, referring to the system's tight demographic base, which is defined by the appeal of signature games like the Halo series. The new shows will be available exclusively via the Xbox 360 for a time, then may appear elsewhere, Safran said."

                "WASHINGTON — In late January, as China locked down some provinces to contain the spread of the coronavirus, average internet speeds in the country slowed as people who were stuck inside went online more and clogged the networks. In Hubei Province, the epicenter of infections, mobile broadband speeds fell by more than half. In mid-February, when the virus hit Italy, Germany and Spain, internet speeds in those countries also began to deteriorate. And last week, as a wave of stay-at-home orders rolled out across the United States, the average time it took to download videos, emails and documents increased as broadband speeds declined 4.9 percent from the previous week, according to Ookla, a broadband speed testing service. Median download speeds dropped 38 percent in San Jose, Calif., and 24 percent in New York, according to Broadband Now, a consumer broadband research site. Quarantines around the world have made people more reliant on the internet to communicate, work, learn and stay entertained. But as the use of YouTube, Netflix, Zoom videoconferencing, Facebook calls and videogaming has surged to new highs, the stress on internet infrastructure is starting to show in Europe and the United States — and the traffic is probably far from its peak. “This is totally unprecedented,” said Thierry Breton, a European Union commissioner who oversees digital policy and was a chief executive of France Télécom. “We have to be proactive.” To head off problems, European regulators like Mr. Breton have pushed streaming companies such as Netflix and YouTube to reduce the size of their video files so they don’t take up as much bandwidth. In the United States, regulators have given wireless carriers access to more spectrum to bolster the capacity of their networks. Some tech companies have responded to the call to ease internet traffic. YouTube, which is owned by Google, said this week that it would reduce the quality of its videos from high to standard definition across the globe. Disney delayed the start of its Disney Plus streaming service in France by two weeks, and Microsoft’s Xbox asked gaming companies to introduce online updates and new releases only at certain times to prevent network congestion. “We really don’t know how long we’re going to be in this mode for,” Dave Temkin, Netflix’s vice president of network and systems infrastructure, said in a webinar on Wednesday on how the coronavirus could affect internet infrastructure. Internet service providers like Comcast, Vodafone, Verizon and Telefónica have been building out their networks for years to account for increasing demand. But company officials said they had never seen such a steep, sudden surge. Growth that the industry had expected to take a year is happening over days, said Enrique Blanco, the chief technology officer at Telefónica, a Spanish telecommunications company. “In just two days we grew all the traffic we had planned for 2020,” Mr. Blanco said. On Monday, traffic on AT&T’s networks was up 27 percent compared to the same day last month, and last week Verizon experienced a 22 percent increase in traffic on its wireless and fiber broadband service. Wi-Fi calls doubled from their normal volume, the carriers said. In Europe, internet traffic into homes over fixed lines was up more than 30 percent, according to Telefónica. Activities like online gaming and video conferencing have more than doubled, while messages over WhatsApp have more than quadrupled. So much traffic and stress on internet networks has slowed the speed of downloading web pages and apps, according to Ookla. “Congestion is higher,” said Adriane Blum, an Ookla spokeswoman. “We’re all at home, and the activities we’re doing in this unprecedented time are not low-bandwidth usage, which means a lot of activity on a network.” Cisco said demand for its WebEx teleconference service had tracked the spread of the coronavirus. Demand first surged in Asia, then in Europe, and last week it soared 240 percent in the United States. The demand has pushed up failure rates delivering video conferencing, said Sri Srinivasan, a Cisco senior vice president in charge of WebEx. “I don’t know if we’ll soon see a peak, not for weeks to come,” he said. “The reason I say that is because we aren’t seeing traffic in Asia slow down even now.” Internet service providers said they could handle the deluge of traffic but were adding capacity. Verizon, Cox and AT&T said they were building more cell sites to strengthen mobile networks, increasing the number of fiber connections on their network backbones, and upgrading the routing and switching technology that lets devices talk to one another and share an internet connection. Orange, formerly France Télécom, has doubled its capacity inside undersea internet cables. In Italy, where home internet use is up 90 percent, Telecom Italia said its technicians continued to make repairs and add capacity. Vodafone, one of Europe’s largest networks operators, said it had increased its capacity 50 percent in recent weeks through a mix of software and the addition of more equipment in the field. “We’re seeing some signs of stress,” AT&T’s chief executive, Randall Stephenson, said in an interview on CNN on Sunday. “We’re having to go out and do some augmentation of networks, and so we’re sending our employees out there to get that done, but right now the network is performing quite well.” To prevent clogged networks, Europe has taken the most aggressive steps. Last week, Mr. Breton, the European Union commissioner, discussed reducing the bitstreams of videos with Reed Hastings, the chief executive of Netflix; Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Google; and Susan Wojcicki, the head of YouTube. The companies agreed, as did Amazon for its Prime Video streaming service and Twitch, its online gaming platform. Many of the companies then went further. On Tuesday, Netflix decided to switch its high-definition video streams in India, Australia and Latin America to slightly lower quality to reduce the traffic they create there by 25 percent, and YouTube said it would make all global streams standard definition. “We continue to work closely with governments and network operators around the globe to do our part to minimize stress on the system during this unprecedented situation,” YouTube said in a statement. Microsoft’s Xbox gaming business recently asked large gaming companies to release online updates of their games during off-peak hours while it helped focus on the critical internet needs of people involved in the coronavirus crisis, according to an Xbox email reviewed by The New York Times. Video game updates can require great amounts of bandwidth to download. Xbox asked the companies to release updates in a four-hour overnight window in North America, and only from Monday through Thursday. “Microsoft is actively monitoring performance and usage trends to ensure we’re optimizing service for our customers worldwide, and accommodating new growth and demand,” the company said. “At the same time, these are unprecedented times, and we’re also taking proactive steps to plan for these high-usage periods.” While U.S. regulators said they did not plan to follow Europe in asking for streaming and social media companies to degrade their services, they are taking other steps. Last week, the Federal Communications Commission granted Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile temporary access to more airwaves. “The F.C.C. has been coordinating closely with network operators to ensure those networks remain up and running,” Ajit Pai, the agency’s chairman, said in a statement. Telefónica’s Mr. Blanco, who has been living under a lockdown in Spain, said he expected the record traffic to last for some time. It may even become the new normal, he said. In Spain, internet use drops only at 8 p.m., when people across the country go to their windows to cheer health workers and others who are helping to manage the crisis. “Suddenly at 8 p.m. it goes down, then it goes back up,” Mr. Blanco said. “It’s a beautiful thing.” Cecilia Kang reported from Washington, Davey Alba from New York and Adam Satariano from London.

                "The last time I was unemployed was in the depths of the Great Recession. I had recently moved in with my girlfriend, who suddenly found herself with an out-of-work partner who rarely left the house. But she gave me some surprising advice: Play video games. I would have a lot of time on my hands, she said, and while I could and should certainly do other things — housework, exercise, searching for a job — I would mostly be stuck at home with limited resources. Without something to occupy my mind, I’d go crazy. She was right. Playing video games helped ease my mind, elevate my mood and possibly saved our relationship. This year we’ll celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary. So now I’m going to give the same advice to anyone who is now out of work, or otherwise kept at home: Play video games. And don’t feel bad about it. If you’re not a gamer, you might think of video games as simple time-wasters. But for those stuck mostly inside without work, killing time is a real problem. And in the world of big-budget console games, 10 to 15 hours is a fairly short experience. Some can take hundreds of hours to complete. There are online games designed to be played and replayed for thousands of hours. But games are more than just empty time-wasters. In periods of pain, boredom or personal emptiness, video games can serve as palliative care for both the body and the mind. Think of gaming as a personal stimulus plan for a nation of unexpected shut-ins: It’s not a long-term solution, it won’t work for everyone, and it won’t solve the underlying problems — but it can provide limited, temporary relief for some. Video games take many forms, but they are all essentially simulations. And when the real world is temporarily unavailable, a simulated version might be what we need. Among other things, video games simulate work: Even the simplest games give players tasks, objectives, lists of things they have to do, problems to solve and a sense of accomplishment upon completion. And the biggest modern games offer seemingly endless lists of quests and objectives, tasks and subtasks, systems to learn and skills to be mastered. A game like the online shooter Destiny 2 offers hundreds, if not thousands, of hours of play, exploration and study. Set in an intricately designed sci-fi world, it tasks players with taking out wave after wave of alien enemies. It also rewards them for understanding a complex character progression system that involves completing ever-more-difficult goals and objectives, sometimes multiple times, in exchange for rarer and more powerful weapons and armor. You might not actually accomplish anything after a day spent checking off quests and gathering virtual materials, but you’ll feel like you did. Game critics have noted the worklike nature of many modern games for years, not always favorably. But in a world of stay-at-home mass unemployment, even the illusion of accomplishment is probably better than none at all. Indeed, the particular shut-in nature of our current crisis makes video games unusually relevant in a different way: What video games do better than any other medium is simulate places. Open-world games like Skyrim, Red Dead Redemption II or The Witcher 3 are built around giant, explorable spaces, sometimes the virtual equivalent of hundreds of square miles, with elaborate geography and shifting weather. They can take days or weeks to fully explore and at their best can be unexpectedly beautiful, offering the opportunity to encounter animated versions of sun-dappled vistas or foggy mountain peaks, to wander through crowded city streets or stroll past others on well-trod footpaths. Games can give us someplace else to go. That makes games useful in another way. Some of us are shut in alone. But especially in cities, many are now effectively trapped inside modest apartments with family or roommates, and little private space. Games offer a form of personal escape, a way to simulate being elsewhere from the confines of your couch. And for those who are alone, games can also serve as social spaces, virtual fields of play for cooperative adventures or competitive contests. Many of today’s most popular games are online experiences that allow players to engage with friends as well as strangers, to forge digital versions of the same sort of bonds with teammates that can develop in the real world. If you’re new at this, the cost of entry is fairly low: There are thousands of high-quality games available for phones, and many more available to download directly to your computer. Even better, many big-budget games are free if you have a computer or game console on which to play them. Late last year, Destiny 2, released in 2017 as a full-priced game, reinvented itself as a free-to-play experience, with the base game available at no cost (players can pay for expansions). Several of the “battle royale” games that have defined the new wave of first-person shooters are also free: A relatively well-reviewed recent entry, Call of Duty: Warzone, offers several clever twists on the popular last-player-standing formula. Not everyone wants to play online shooters, but for those willing to spend a little there are now subscription services that offer access to a large library of games for an annual or monthly fee. For little more than the price of a standard Netflix plan, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate offers access to dozens of games, from moody, philosophical puzzle games like The Talos Principle to richly animated platformers like Ori and the Will of the Wisps. There are sports games, strategy games, role-playing games and simple twitchy diversions that recall the arcade games I pumped quarters into as a kid. And for those who not satisfied with our current quasi-apocalypse, there even games about viral outbreaks and attacks, from the strategic epidemic simulator Plague Inc., to the deftly scripted post-pandemic action game The Last of Us, to The Division 2, a military thriller set in emptied-out recreations of downtown Washington and New York after a viral bioweapon wipes out most of the population. Maybe that one hits a little too close to home. Yes, games are frivolous. Yes, they are escapist. But the longer the coronavirus keeps social life and culture in isolation, the more we’ll need frivolity and escapism. There’s a limit, of course, to what video games can do: They can’t serve as long-term substitutes for real places, real work or real human interaction. But they can give us a simulacrum of all those things at a time when the real ones are in short supply, and tide us over until the world we actually need returns.

            "text": [
                "Like many young hipsters in Austin, Tex., Michael Burns wanted to make it big in some creative field -- perhaps writing comedy scripts in Hollywood. Instead, he wound up in a dead-end job, managing a call center. To kill time, he made friends with a group of equally clever and bored young men at the company where he worked, and they'd sit around talking about their shared passion: video games. Their favorite title was Halo, a best-selling Xbox game in which players control armor-clad soldiers as they wander through gorgeous coastal forests and grim military bunkers and fight an army of lizardlike aliens. Burns and his gang especially loved the \"team versus team\" mode, which is like a digital version of paint ball: instead of fighting aliens, players hook their Xboxes to the Internet, then log on together in a single game, at which point they assemble into two teams -- red-armored soldiers versus blue-armored ones. Instead of shooting aliens, they try to slaughter one another, using grenades, machine guns and death rays. On evenings and weekends, Burns and his friends would cluster around their TV's until the wee hours of the morning, gleefully blowing one another to pieces. \"Halo is like crack,\" Burns recalls thinking. \"I could play it until I die.\" Whenever a friend discovered a particularly cool stunt inside Halo -- for example, obliterating an enemy with a new type of grenade toss -- Burns would record a video of the stunt for posterity. (His friend would perform the move after Burns had run a video cord from his TV to his computer, so he could save it onto his hard drive.) Then he'd post the video on a Web site to show other gamers how the trick was done. To make the videos funnier, sometimes Burns would pull out a microphone and record a comedic voice-over, using video-editing software to make it appear as if the helmeted soldier himself were doing the talking. Then one day he realized that the videos he was making were essentially computer-animated movies, almost like miniature emulations of \"Finding Nemo\" or \"The Incredibles.\" He was using the game to function like a personal Pixar studio. He wondered: Could he use it to create an actual movie or TV series? Burns's group decided to give it a shot. They gathered around the Xbox at Burns's apartment, manipulating their soldiers like tiny virtual actors, bobbing their heads to look as if they were deep in conversation. Burns wrote sharp, sardonic scripts for them to perform. He created a comedy series called \"Red vs. Blue,\" a sort of sci-fi version of \"M*A*S*H.\" In \"Red vs. Blue,\" the soldiers rarely do any fighting; they just stand around insulting one another and musing over the absurdities of war, sounding less like patriotic warriors than like bored, clever video-store clerks. The first 10-minute episode opened with a scene set in Halo's bleakest desert canyon. Two red soldiers stood on their base, peering at two blue soldiers far off in the distance, and traded quips that sounded almost like a slacker disquisition on Iraq: Red Soldier: \"Why are we out here? Far as I can tell, it's just a box canyon in the middle of nowhere, with no way in or out. And the only reason we set up a red base here is because they have a blue base there. And the only reason they have a blue base over there is because we have a red base here.\" When they were done, they posted the episode on their Web site (surreptitiously hosted on computers at work). They figured maybe a few hundred people would see it and get a chuckle or two. Instead, \"Red vs. Blue\" became an instant runaway hit on geek blogs, and within a single day, 20,000 people stampeded to the Web site to download the file. The avalanche of traffic crashed the company server. \"My boss came into the office and was like, 'What the hell is going on?' \" Burns recalls. \"I looked over at the server, and it was going blink, blink, blink.\" Thrilled, Burns and his crew quickly cranked out another video, then another. They kept up a weekly production schedule, and after a few months, \"Red vs. Blue\" had, like some dystopian version of \"Friends,\" become a piece of appointment viewing. Nearly a million people were downloading each episode every Friday, writing mash notes to the creators and asking if they could buy a DVD of the collected episodes. Mainstream media picked up on the phenomenon. The Village Voice described it as \" 'Clerks' meets 'Star Wars,' \" and the BBC called it \"riotously funny\" and said it was \"reminiscent of the anarchic energy of 'South Park.' \" Burns realized something strange was going on. He and his crew had created a hit comedy show -- entirely inside a video game. Video games have not enjoyed good publicity lately. Hillary Clinton has been denouncing the violence in titles like Grand Theft Auto, which was yanked out of many stores last month amid news that players had unlocked sex scenes hidden inside. Yet when they're not bemoaning the virtual bloodshed, cultural pundits grudgingly admit that today's games have become impressively cinematic. It's not merely that the graphics are so good: the camera angles inside the games borrow literally from the visual language of film. When you're playing Halo and look up at the sun, you'll see a little \"lens flare,\" as if you were viewing the whole experience through the eyepiece of a 16-millimeter Arriflex. By using the game to actually make cinema, Burns and his crew flipped a switch that neatly closed a self-referential media loop: movies begat games that begat movies. And Burns and his crew aren't alone. Video-game aficionados have been creating \"machinima\" -- an ungainly term mixing \"machine\" and \"cinema\" and pronounced ma-SHEEN-i-ma -- since the late 90's. \"Red vs. Blue\" is the first to break out of the underground, and now corporations like Volvo are hiring machinima artists to make short promotional films, while MTV, Spike TV and the Independent Film Channel are running comedy shorts and music videos produced inside games. By last spring, Burns and his friends were making so much money from \"Red vs. Blue\" that they left their jobs and founded Rooster Teeth Productions. Now they produce machinima full time. It may be the most unlikely form of indie filmmaking yet -- and one of the most weirdly democratic. \"It's like 'The Blair Witch Project' all over again, except you don't even need a camera,\" says Julie Kanarowski, a product manager with Electronic Arts, the nation's largest video-game publisher. \"You don't even need actors.\" Back in college, Burns and another Rooster Teeth founder, Matt Hullum, wrote and produced a traditional live-action indie movie. It cost $9,000, required a full year to make and was seen by virtually no one. By contrast, the four Xboxes needed to make \"Red vs. Blue\" cost a mere $600. Each 10-minute episode requires a single day to perform and edit and is viewed by hordes of feverish video-game fans the planet over. More than just a cheap way to make an animated movie, machinima allows game players to comment directly on the pop culture they so devotedly consume. Much like \"fan fiction\" (homespun tales featuring popular TV characters) or \"mash-ups\" (music fans blending two songs to create a new hybrid), machinima is a fan-created art form. It's what you get when gamers stop blasting aliens for a second and start messing with the narrative. And God knows, there's plenty to mess with. These days, the worlds inside games are so huge and open-ended that gamers can roam anywhere they wish. Indeed, players often abandon the official goal of the game -- save the princess; vanquish the eldritch forces of evil -- in favor of merely using the virtual environment as a gigantic jungle gym. In one popular piece of Halo machinima, \"Warthog Jump,\" a player cunningly used the game to conduct a series of dazzling physics experiments. He placed grenades in precise locations beneath jeeps and troops, such that when the targets blew sky-high, they pinwheeled through the air in precise formations, like synchronized divers. Another gamer recorded a machinima movie that poked subversive fun at Grand Theft Auto. Instead of playing as a dangerous, cop-killing gangster, the player pretended he was a naïve Canadian tourist -- putting down his gun, dressing in tacky clothes and simply wandering around the game's downtown environment for hours, admiring the scenery. So what's it like to actually shoot a movie inside a game? In June, I visited the Rooster Teeth offices in Buda, Tex., a tiny Austin suburb, to observe Burns and his group as they produced a scene of \"Red vs. Blue.\" Burns, a tall, burly 32-year-old, sat in front of two huge flat-panel screens, preparing the editing software. Nearby were the two Rooster Teeth producers who would be acting on-screen: Geoff Ramsey, a scraggly-bearded 30-year-old whose arms are completely covered in tattoos of fish and skulls, and Gustavo Sorola, a gangly 27-year-old who sprawled in a beanbag chair and peered through his thick architect glasses at the day's e-mail. They were fan letters, Sorola told me, that pour in from teenagers who are as enthusiastic as they are incoherent. \"The way kids write these days,\" he said with a grimace. \"It's like someone threw up on the keyboard.\" In the script they were acting out that day, a pair of \"Red vs. Blue\" soldiers engaged in one of their typically pointless existential arguments, bickering over whether it's possible to kill someone with a toy replica of a real weapon. The Rooster Teeth crew recorded the voice-overs earlier in the day; now they were going to create the animation for the scene. Burns picked up a controller and booted up Halo on an Xbox. He would act as the camera: whatever his character saw would be recorded, from his point of view. Then Sorola and Ramsey logged into the game, teleporting in as an orange-suited and a red-suited soldier. Burns posed them near a massive concrete bunker and frowned as he scrutinized the view on the computer screen. \"Hmmmm,\" he muttered. \"We need something to frame you guys -- some sort of prop.\" He ran his character over to a nearby alien hovercraft, jumped in and parked it next to the actors. \"Sweet!\" he said. \"I like it!\" In a \"Red vs. Blue\" shoot, the actors all must follow one important rule: Be careful not to accidentally kill another actor. \"Sometimes you'll drop your controller and it unintentionally launches a grenade. It takes, like, 20 minutes for the blood splatters to dry up,\" Ramsey said. \"Totally ruins the scene.\" Finally, Burns was ready to go. He shouted, \"Action!\" and the voice-overs began playing over loudspeakers. Sorola and Ramsey acted in time with the dialogue. Acting, in this context, was weirdly minimalist. They mashed the controller joysticks with their thumbs, bobbing the soldiers' heads back and forth roughly in time with important words in each line. \"It's puppetry, basically,\" Ramsey said, as he jiggled his controller. Of all the \"Red vs. Blue\" crew members, Ramsey is renowned for his dexterity with an Xbox. When a scene calls for more than five actors onstage, he'll put another controller on the ground and manipulate it with his right foot, allowing him to perform as two characters simultaneously. As I watched, I was reminded of what initially cracked me up so much about \"Red vs. Blue\": the idea that faceless, anonymous soldiers in a video game have interior lives. It's a \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern\" conceit; \"Red vs. Blue\" is what the game characters talk about when we're not around to play with them. As it turns out, they're a bunch of neurotics straight out of \"Seinfeld.\" One recruit reveals that he chain-smokes inside his airtight armor; a sergeant tells a soldier his battle instructions are to \"scream like a woman.\" And, in a sardonic gloss on the game's endless carnage, none of the soldiers have the vaguest clue why they're fighting. Yet as I discovered, real-life soldiers are among the most ardent fans of \"Red vs. Blue.\" When I walked around the Rooster Teeth office, I found it was festooned with letters, plaques and an enormous American flag, gifts from grateful American troops, many of whom are currently stationed in Iraq. Isn't it a little astonishing, I asked Burns when the crew went out in the baking Texas sun for a break, that actual soldiers are so enamored of a show that portrays troops as inept cowards, leaders as cynical sociopaths and war itself as a supremely meaningless endeavor? Burns laughed, but said the appeal was nothing sinister. \" 'Red vs. Blue' is about downtime,\" he said. \"There's very little action, which is precisely the way things are in real life.\" \"He's right,\" Ramsey added. He himself spent five years in the army after high school. \"We'd just sit around digging ditches and threatening to kill each other all day long,\" he said. \"We were bored out of our minds.\" Perhaps the most unusual thing about machinima is that none of its creators are in jail. After all, they're gleefully plundering intellectual property at a time when the copyright wars have become particularly vicious. Yet video-game companies have been upbeat -- even exuberant -- about the legions of teenagers and artists pillaging their games. This is particularly bewildering in the case of \"Red vs. Blue,\" because Halo is made by Bungie, a subsidiary of Microsoft, a company no stranger to using a courtroom to defend its goods. What the heck is going on? As it turns out, people at Bungie love \"Red vs. Blue.\" \"We thought it was kind of brilliant,\" says Brian Jarrard, the Bungie staff member who manages interactions with fans. \"There are people out there who would never have heard about Halo without 'Red vs. Blue.' It's getting an audience outside the hardcore gaming crowd.\" Sure, Rooster Teeth ripped off Microsoft's intellectual property. But Microsoft got something in return: \"Red vs. Blue\" gave the game a whiff of countercultural coolness, the sort of grass-roots street cred that major corporations desperately crave but can never manufacture. After talking with Rooster Teeth, Microsoft agreed, remarkably, to let them use the game without paying any licensing fees at all. In fact, the company later hired Rooster Teeth to produce \"Red vs. Blue\" videos to play as advertisements in game stores. Microsoft has been so strangely solicitous that when it was developing the sequel to Halo last year, the designers actually inserted a special command -- a joystick button that makes a soldier lower his weapon -- designed solely to make it easier for Rooster Teeth to do dialogue. \"If you're playing the game, there's no reason to lower your weapon at all,\" Burns explained. \"They put that in literally just so we can shoot machinima.\" Other game companies have gone even further. Many now include editing software with their games, specifically to encourage fans to shoot movies. When Valve software released its hit game Half-Life 2 last year, it included \"Faceposer\" software so that machinima creators could tweak the facial expressions of characters. When the Sims 2 -- a sequel to the top-selling game of all time -- came out last year, its publisher, Electronic Arts, set up a Web site so that fans could upload their Sims 2 movies to show to the world. (About 8,000 people so far have done so.) Still, it's one thing for gamers to produce a jokey comedy or a music video. Can machinima actually produce a work of art -- something with serious emotional depth? A few people have tried. In China, a visual artist named Feng Mengbo used the first-person-shooter game Quake III to produce Q4U, in which the screen is filled with multiple versions of himself, killing one another. Players' relationships with constant, blood-splattering violence is a common subject in game art. Last year, the 31-year-old artist Brody Condon produced an unsettling film that consisted of nothing but shots of himself committing suicide inside 50 different video games. \"I try to come to terms with what taking your life means in these games,\" Condon says. \"I'm trying to understand, spiritually, your relationship with an avatar on the screen.\" But even machinima's biggest fans admit that the vast majority of machinima is pretty amateurish. \"It's like if some friends of mine all broke into a movie set, and we all got to use all the cameras and special-effects equipment,\" says Carl Goodman, director of digital media at the American Museum of the Moving Image, which began to hold an annual machinima festival two years ago. \"We wouldn't quite know how to use it, but we'd make some pretty interesting stuff.\" Yet as Goodman points out, there's a competing proposition. Machinima does not always strive to emulate \"realistic,\" artistic movies. On the contrary, it is often explicitly devoted to celebrating the aesthetics of games -- the animations and in-jokes, the precise physics. Most machinima is probably meaningless to people who don't play games, much as ESPN is opaque to anyone who doesn't watch sports. But for those who do play Halo, it was genuinely thrilling to see something like \"Warthog Jump,\" with its meticulously synchronized explosions. The Rooster Teeth crew has its own hilariously stringent rule for making machinima: no cheating. When they shoot \"Red vs. Blue,\" they do not use any special effects that are not organically included in the game; everything you see in an episode of \"Red vs. Blue\" could in theory have taken place during an actual game of Halo, played by a fan in his bedroom. It's a charmingly purist attitude, a sci-fi version of the \"Dogma\" school of indie film, which argues that movies are best when cinematic trickery is kept to a minimum. One evening in New York, I visited with Ethan Vogt as he and his machinima team shot a car-chase scene for a Volvo promo. Vogt and two producers sat at computers, logged into a multiplayer game; each producer controlled a car racing through crowded city streets, while Vogt controlled a free-floating \"camera\" that followed behind, recording the visuals. The vehicles -- an enormous 1972 Chevy Impala and a Volvo V50 -- screamed along at about 60 miles an hour, fishtailing through corners while plowing into mailboxes, lampposts and, occasionally, clots of pedestrians. The lead car burst into flames. \"That's great,\" Vogt said. \"That's great.\" Though it shares with independent filmmaking a do-it-yourself aesthetic, machinima inverts the central tradition of indie film: smallness. With their skimpy budgets, indie directors tend to set movies in kitchens or living rooms -- and focus instead on providing quality acting and scripts. Machinima, in contrast, often has horribly cheesy acting and ham-fisted, purple-prose stories -- but they're set in outer space. Want massive shootouts? Howling mob scenes? Roman gladiatorial armies clashing by night? No problem. It is the rare form of amateur film in which the directors aspire to be not Wes Anderson but George Lucas. Indeed, with video games played on computers, it is now possible to build an entire world from scratch. The core of any video game is its game engine, the software that knows how to render 3-D objects and how to realistically represent the physics of how they move, bounce or collide. But the actual objects inside the game -- the people, the cars, the guns, even the buildings -- can be altered, tweaked or replaced by modifications, or \"mods.\" Mods do not require any deep programming skills; indeed, almost any teenager with a passing acquaintance in graphic-design software can \"re-skin\" a character in a game to make it look like himself, for instance. (Xbox and PlayStation games, in comparison, are much harder to mod, because the consoles are locked boxes, designed to prevent players from tampering with the games.) I was able to see modding in action one night when I visited the ILL Clan, a pioneering machinima group. Their headquarters are the kitchen table in the cramped one-bedroom Brooklyn apartment of Frank Dellario; a lanky, hyperkinetic 42-year-old, he sat on a rickety folding chair, pecking at a keyboard. The table was littered with four computer screens and laptops, the remnants of take-out sushi and a hopelessly tangled morass of computer cords and joysticks; a huge wide-screen TV lurked behind them for viewing their work. On the night I visited, they were using a game engine called Torque to shoot a short heist movie for Audi, in which two thugs beat up a concert violinist and make off with an antique violin in a van. To quickly create a gritty-looking city, Dellario and his colleague -- ILL Clan's co-founder, Matt Dominianni -- hired a local artist to build a generic-looking urban intersection inside the game. To customize it, Dominianni went onto Google, found snapshots of a few seedy stores (an adult bookstore, a tattoo parlor and a furniture outlet) and digitally pasted them onto the front of the buildings. Then they went to a site called Turbo-Squid, a sort of Amazon for virtual in-game items, and for $45 bought a van that could be plunked down inside the game. When I arrived, they were browsing the site and contemplating buying a few women. \"My God, look at this one,\" Dellario marveled, as he clicked open a picture of an eerily realistic 3-D brunette named Masha. \"I'm going to marry this woman. They've finally broken through to total reality.\" Dellario put the van into the correct location in the scene, then logged into the game to figure out the camera angle for this shot. He frowned. It didn't look right. The lighting was all off, with shadows falling in the wrong places. Dominianni figured out the problem: \"The sun is supposed to be at high noon. It's in the wrong place.\" \"Oh, yeah,\" Dellario said. \"Let me move it.\" He pulled up a menu, clicked on the \"sun\" command, and dragged it across the sky. Now they were finally ready to shoot. Dellario realized they needed an extra pair of hands to manipulate one of the thugs. \"Want to act in this scene?\" Dellario asked, and he handed me a joystick. I sat down at one of the computers and took control of \"Thug1,\" a brown-haired man in a golf shirt and brown pants, carrying the stolen violin. Dominianni was playing \"Thug2.\" Our characters were supposed to look around to make sure the coast is clear, then jump in the truck and race off. Dellario gave me my motivation: \"It's like you hear a suspicious noise. You're nervous.\" I used the joystick to practice moving my virtual character, craning its neck -- my neck? -- back and forth. I have played plenty of video games, but this felt awfully odd. Usually when I am inside a game, I'm just worried about staying alive while the bullets whiz past my ears. I've never had to emote. While Dellario and Dominianni fiddled with the camera angle, I grew impatient and wandered around, exploring the virtual set. I peered in a few shop windows -- they were strikingly photorealistic, even up close. Then I walked down an alley and suddenly arrived at the end of the set. It was like a tiny Western town in the desert: once you got beyond the few clustered buildings, there was nothing there -- just a vast, enormous plain, utterly empty and stretching off infinitely into the distance. This spring, electronic arts decided to promote the Sims 2 by hiring Rooster Teeth to create a machinima show using the game. Called \"The Strangerhood,\" it would be freely available online. \"The Strangerhood\" is a parody of reality TV: a group of people wake up one day to discover that they are living in new houses, and they can't remember who they are or how they got there. In the Sims 2, the animated people are impressively Pixar-like and expressive, making \"The Strangerhood\" even more like a mainstream animated show than \"Red vs. Blue\"; you could almost imagine watching it on Saturday morning. The problem is, the Sims 2 has turned out to be incredibly difficult to shoot with. When the Rooster Teeth gang uses Halo for machinima, the characters are mere puppets and can be posed any way the creators want. But in the Sims 2, the little virtual characters have artificial intelligence and free will. When you're playing, you do not control all the action: the fun is in putting your Sims in interesting social situations, then standing back and watching what they'll do. When Rooster Teeth's Matt Hullum builds a virtual set and puts the \"Strangerhood\" characters in place for a shoot, he's never quite sure what will happen. To shoot a scene in which two men wake up in bed together, Hullum had to spend hours playing with the two characters -- who are nominally heterosexual -- forcing them into repeated conversations until they eventually became such good friends they were willing to share a bed. Shooting machinima with Sims is thus maddeningly like using actual, human stars: they're stubborn; they stage hissy fits and stomp off to their trailers. \"We'll do three or four takes of a scene, and one of the Sims will start getting tired and want to go to sleep,\" Hullum said. \"It's just like being on a real set. You're screaming: 'Quick, quick, get the shot! We're losing light!' \" Hullum showed me a typical \"Strangerhood\" scene. He put Nikki, a young ponytailed brunette in a baseball cap, in the kitchen to interact with Wade, a slacker who looked eerily like a digital Owen Wilson. (To give Wade a mellow, San Francisco vibe, Hullum programmed him to move at a pace 50 percent slower than the other characters.) Hullum pointed to Nikki's \"mood\" bar; it was low, which meant she was in a bad mood and wouldn't want to talk. \"When they're bored, you have to lock them in a room alone for a few hours until they start to crave conversation,\" Hullum said. He tried anyway, prodding Wade to approach her and talk about food, one of Nikki's favorite subjects. It worked. The two became engrossed in a conversation, laughing and gesticulating wildly. \"See, this footage would be great if we were shooting a scene where these guys are maybe gossiping,\" Hullum mused, as he zoomed the camera in to frame a close-up on Wade. Then Nikki started to yawn. \"Oh, damn. See -- she's getting bored. Oh, no, she's walking away,\" Hullum said, as the little virtual Nikki wandered out of the room. \"Damn. You see what we have to deal with?\" The audience for \"The Strangerhood\" has not exploded the way \"Red vs. Blue\" did. The project is a gamble: its creators hope it will break out of machinima's geeky subculture and vault into the mainstream. Though in a way, Hullum said, the mainstream isn't always a fun place to be, either. Before he returned to Austin to work on \"Red vs. Blue,\" he spent six miserable years in Hollywood working on second-rate teen movies with big budgets, like \"Scooby-Doo\" and \"The Faculty.\" \"So now to come to this, where we have total creative control of our own stuff, it's amazing,\" Hullum said, as he watched Nikki walk out of the house in search of a more interesting conversation. \"I just pray we can keep this going. Because if we can't, I'm in big trouble.\" Clive Thompson is a contributing writer for the magazine."

                "SYNTHETIC WORLDS The Business and Culture of Online Games. By Edward Castronova. 332 pp. University of Chicago Press. $29. SMARTBOMB The Quest for Art, Entertainment and Big Bucks in the Videogame Revolution. By Heather Chaplin and Aaron Ruby. 287 pp. Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill. $24.95. Here's a theory that may be neither original nor empirically defensible but feels true: The more fun an activity is, the less interesting it is to read about. War producces great journalism; water-skiing does not. Can you guess where video games fall on this spectrum? In the last few years, a great many words have been expended to report on this flourishing cultural phenomenon. Most accounts begin with a hyperactive presentation of statistics, which we will not rehearse here. This is all you need to know (and perhaps already do): Video games have grown into a huge business, outpacing the movie industry and bulldozing childhood as we knew it. We adults are not safe, either. Whether they admit it or not, you probably have friends who can be found awake at 2 a.m. disemboweling orcs, foiling terrorist plots and scooping up fumbles and running them into end zones. It is the opinion of Edward Castronova, author of \"Synthetic Worlds,\" that such electronic experiences are not merely a hedge against boredom but a profound indicator of where the entire world is heading. Online, off-line; reality, fantasy -- these distinctions will cease to matter as more and more of us pass our time in virtual environments. Economies will evolve as we pay real money for virtual goods and vice versa. Conflicts that begin online will spill into the real world and back. Laws will be written to protect our newfound interests. Castronova's vision has elements of both utopia and dystopia. But mostly he is bullish. Life in these alternative zones may eventually become so fulfilling, he contends, \"that a fairly substantial exodus may loom in the distance.\" He means this, really. Like the Irish and Italians who left their native lands in the late 19th century to come to America, gamers could create a genuine human migration, away from the real and into the virtual. What will be real then? The specific object of Castronova's scholarship is Mmorpgs, the inelegant acronym for \"massively multiplayer online role-playing games,\" which can involve hundreds of thousands of players plugging in from all over the world. A disproportionate number of these games revolve around dwarfs, wizards, quests and magic lands, though the content is becoming ever more diverse. These days, there's a Mmorpg out there to suit the interests of just about anybody. One game, The Sims Online, merely simulates suburban life, and it is madly popular. Castronova is an economist who teaches telecommunications at Indiana University, and among academic economists he is a bold contrarian, if only because he dares to take computer games seriously. My oh my does he take them seriously. In dense, lifeless prose, he sledgehammers away at his major themes, constantly pausing to review the material he's just covered and preview what is to come. His sweeping conclusions are intriguing -- get ready for governments sending agents into virtual worlds and waging war with avatars! -- but he's not a vivid enough writer to animate most of his futuristic abstractions. In \"Smartbomb,\" Heather Chaplin and Aaron Ruby try harder to entertain. They've organized their history of video games as a study of ambitious individuals, breaking it down into a series of breezy, magazinelike profiles of uneven quality. A lot of the original reporting seems to take place at gaming conventions, which is not where one imagines the really interesting stuff happens. But the stories are pretty good, even when they don't break new ground. Rereading the legend of Nolan Bushnell and the founding of Atari is like hearing a bar band play a spirited \"Twist and Shout\" -- enjoyable, but no additional points for Degree of Difficulty. In two spots, though, Chaplin and Ruby really score. In their chapter on Mmorpgs, they sensitively profile David Reber, a 30-year-old Californian who spends every free moment chained to his computer, acting out a series of intense fantasy existences that provide him with the companionship and sense of achievement missing in his real life. Just as Castronova would predict, Reber withdraws from the real world as his fantasy life deepens -- he has lapses at work and when Chaplin and Ruby last check in with him, he's moved back in with his mother. The other winning portrait in \"Smartbomb\" is of Will Wright, the creator of SimCity, as well as its offshoot The Sims, and a new simulation called Spore in which players guide a new creature from its biological origin onward. In an industry that mimics Hollywood's craven predilection for cheap, gory theatrics, Wright stands apart as a humble philosopher in love with the potential of games to expand the human experience. Though Chaplin and Ruby don't have much to say themselves about the significance of video games, they wisely hand matters over to Wright, who foresees a future that might just keep us all staying up past 2 a.m. \"I think one thing that's unique about video games is not only that they can respond to you but down the road they'll be able to adapt themselves to you. They'll learn your desires,\" he says. \"It might just be that games become deeply personal artifacts -- more like dreams.\" Video Game Books Hugo Lindgren is the editorial director of New York Magazine."

                "THE great thing about shopping for video games is that the person you're buying the gift for almost certainly knows more about it than you do. If you have gamers in your life, no matter what age, odds are that they already know exactly what they want. You need only shut up and fork over the credit card. You can use this to your advantage. If you are lucky enough that the gamer on your list has said anything recently about a game or game machine that is not Microsoft's new Xbox 360, the smart move is to drop whatever you're doing right now and buy it. That way, you will not be among the hordes this holiday season already wondering if they can afford to miss a car payment, or maybe a mortgage installment, to satisfy their 360-craving gamer. That is because the 360, with its snazzy graphics and slick online interface, has emerged as the It gift of the 2005 holiday season. Theoretically, the 360 is supposed to cost $300 for a basic unit and $400 for the deluxe version. In reality, the console is sold out across the country and is now fetching $1,000 or so on eBay. And that's before you buy any games, which run up to $60 each. So if your favorite gamer is interested in anything else this year, consider yourself fortunate. Thankfully, forgoing the 360 doesn't mean returning to the Stone Age of, say, Pong. There are still excellent games being made for the current generation of home game consoles -- Sony's PlayStation 2, Nintendo's GameCube, and the original Xbox, which each cost less than $200 -- and Sony's $250 PSP headlines the strong current crop of hand-held units. Moreover, if you have a powerful PC, that may still be your most capable game machine. In any case, both Sony and Nintendo have new game consoles on the way next year. And availability of the 360 is sure to improve in early 2006. There is a chance that Microsoft could show up with a \"surprise\" boatload of additional 360's in the next few weeks. (The word from the company is that it is working as hard as it can to get units to retailers.) Unless you're willing to pay the prices on eBay or other auction sites, the best advice to shoppers who absolutely must have a 360 is to get themselves on waiting lists at as many retailers and Web sites as possible. So those folks you saw camped out on sidewalks before the 360 went on sale on Nov. 22 don't look so silly now, right? Waiting in line for a midnight sale at a Wal-Mart in Moline, Ill., Kara Harvell told The Quad-City Times that she wanted to buy the console for her five sons. Deliciously, the newspaper reported that Ms. Harvell, a nursing school student, \"got out of class by telling her professor that her son wasn't feeling well at school.\" Of course, some people don't like waiting in line. In the (very) few days before the machine sold out, scattered reports emerged of shoppers being held up for their 360's as they left stores. Please don't go robbing anyone. But if you've already gone through the effort of finding a 360 at its regular price, it is certainly worth the extra $100 for the higher-end model. The full version comes with a headset (for making free phone calls over the Internet to other Xbox users), a wireless controller (instead of a wired model) and a hard drive, which you need to play games made for the original Xbox. Top-line games are $50 to $60. The unit comes with a free basic membership to Microsoft's online game service, which lets you talk to other online 360 users and compare scores. But if you want to actually play head-to-head live over the Internet, you need to buy the \"gold\" membership, which costs $8 a month or $50 a year. In addition to playing games with eye-popping graphics, the machine plays DVD's and can display photos from your digital camera on your regular or high-definition television. Luckily, the 360 is not the only game system potentially worth buying this holiday season. There are cheaper and more readily available options, too. Besides the Xbox 360, the other major new game machine is Sony's PSP hand-held. The sleek black unit has a clear, colorful screen that is far more vibrant than one would expect from a hand-held device, and that may be why people on buses and trains seem to be using their PSP's to watch movies as much as playing games. Dozens of movies are now being released on the small UMD data discs that slip into the back of the PSP, which inexplicably comes with white headphones reminiscent of those supplied with Apple's iPods. Over all, the games for the PSP have been lackluster so far, but that trend shows signs of changing. Aimed at adults, the new Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories takes advantage of the PSP's built-in wireless capability to allow multiple PSP users to battle one another through the game's streets and alleys, even as the players themselves are on the go. Next year, a new installment of the quirky family-friendly Japanese game Katamari Damacy is expected for the PSP. Even cheaper and smaller than the PSP is Nintendo's DS hand-held, which costs about $130. Nintendo has long been popular with young gamers, but the new Nintendogs pet simulator is finding fans among both children and adult women. The screens on the DS, which stands for dual screen, are not quite as impressive as the PSP's, but are still clear enough for enjoyable gaming. But rather than play on the go, many people still prefer their video games on the television in the den. With all of the hype around the 360 it is easy to overlook that you can now buy the original Xbox or Sony's PlayStation 2 each for around $150. Bundles that include a console and a few games can be found under $300 on the Web. Nintendo's GameCube console now costs only around $100. Of course, the Xbox, GameCube and PS2 certainly don't have the cachet of the new 360. And most serious gamers already have one, two or even all three of the older systems. But if you are looking for a cost-effective way to introduce a young person to gaming, buying any of the older systems is a smart move. In fact, many serious gamers would argue that the games being made now for those mature machines are actually better than those for the 360, which is still so new that developers have not yet figured out how to fully harness its power. The older games just don't look quite as snazzy. But until Sony's PlayStation 3 and Nintendo's Revolution are released next year, the Xbox 360 is clearly the best gaming machine around (unless you want to consider a top-notch gaming PC, which could easily cost more than $2,000). If someone you know wants a 360 and you can't find it at a reasonable price, perhaps fend them off with a PSP or a gift certificate that can be exchanged for some new games for an existing console. Then promise you'll get a 360, PlayStation 3 or Revolution next year. You may forget the promise, but they won't. Is It Live, or Is It A Video Game? THERE are about 20 games available for Microsoft's new Xbox 360. It does not have a single hit title yet, as Halo became for the original Xbox, and the lineup is still missing some genres, like role-playing games. Nonetheless, games out now do a good job of demonstrating how the next generation of consoles deliver visual and social experiences far more sophisticated than those possible on older consoles. The strongest two genres on the 360 are auto racing and first-person shooters. On the racetrack, Project Gotham Racing 3 lets you speed through detailed recreated cities like New York, Las Vegas and London. You can race in online leagues, compete against \"ghosts\" that simulate your friends' best performances or \"tune in\" and watch from the sidelines as some of the best virtual drivers in the world go wheel to wheel. The shooters put a player in the perspective of a person fighting, often with guns. Among the standouts are Perfect Dark Zero, set in the near future, and Call of Duty 2, a gritty re-creation of World War II. The most visually impressive 360 game is Kameo: Elements of Power, an action adventure that looks like child's play, with its evocation of a Pixar animated film, but is challenging at points. About half the games for the 360 mimic real-life sports. NBA 2K6, which at times could pass for a live telecast, is the most impressive of the bunch. Amped 3, a snowboarding simulator, is easy to play and gorgeous to watch. SETH SCHIESEL"

                "Tomorrow the Xbox, the new video-game console from Microsoft, arrives in stores on the heels of a $500 million marketing blitz. But it doesn't seem as if much of that money is going to the thousands of musicians who have provided the company with songs to use in the games that will be played on it. Though a band can typically make $10,000 to $20,000 when a song is included in a video game, Microsoft has been asking musicians to contribute their music to video games for pennies -- and in some cases no money at all, with no upfront fee and no royalties on the back end. Musicians, from small, independent punk bands to major-label artists, have been accepting this deal, hoping for the promotional boost that comes with being heard in a game that is played obsessively by teenagers across the country. Joining a band is not a lucrative career choice for most musicians. Many who are signed to major labels spend their careers in debt to those record companies, trying to earn back advances and expenses. But the increasing use of contemporary songs in movies, video games and advertisements has meant an unexpected windfall for lesser-known and midlevel artists. Microsoft, however, is changing that dynamic. ''I asked if we could get any money, and they just said no,'' said Larry Cooper, who runs Revelation Records, a punk, metal and hardcore label that has several songs on the soundtrack to Amped, a snowboarding game. ''I almost thought that out of principle, if there's no payment, we shouldn't do that kind of stuff. But I didn't want to snip out an opportunity for a band that might want to do that kind of promotion.'' Of the bands Mr. Cooper asked, all but one agreed to provide free music to Microsoft. ''I think they were just looking for cheap music, and that's why they called a lot of small labels,'' Mr. Cooper continued. ''I asked them who else was on the soundtrack and made some suggestions, but they said they wanted to stick with certain labels because they didn't have to pay for licensing.'' Brenner Adams, a product planner on Amped, said that on his game Microsoft was looking not for cheap music but for an opportunity to expose as many small underground bands as possible. Under Microsoft policy the interview with Mr. Adams was conducted with a company publicist on the line, taking notes on the conversation. ''We're not saying, 'Hey, we want to use your music for nothing,' '' Mr. Adams said. ''We said, 'Hey, we really want to promote these artists and promote who they are and what they stand for.' '' Though Microsoft didn't give any money to musicians on such independent labels, it did offer small amounts to bands on major labels. It made a deal with Virgin Records, obtaining songs from acts like the Gorillaz, Iggy Pop, the Chemical Brothers and Timbaland & Magoo by paying ''small fees and publishing,'' said Brad Fox, the director of artist development at Virgin. The amount of course remains a big contrast to the millions of dollars that Microsoft is believed to have paid to use Madonna's ''Ray of Light'' in its 60-second Windows XP advertisement. ''We're looking at this as a marketing exercise,'' Mr. Fox said. ''There's no way I could get 10 to 15 different artists in somebody's house in front of an active consumer audience for 20 hours a week. If I could get 20 percent of those kids to go buy a record, that's great.'' But the Xbox isn't like other systems, nor are these deals like other deals. Many record labels are operating on the faith that Microsoft will make efforts to promote their bands. Mr. Fox said he hoped that the Virgin artists used in the games would be mentioned in Xbox promotional material, game catalogs and game boxes. But a trip to the Xbox Web site showed that the artists on games like Amped were not mentioned on the box or promotional poster shown online, nor were the bands on any game highlighted in any special way on the Web site. Other promotional efforts, however, have been made: there was a link at the site to a radio station playing music from Amped, and at a recent Xbox promotional party in Los Angeles Microsoft gave away a CD with music from Amped. Mr. Adams noted that most of the cash deals were made with better-known bands that don't need the publicity as much. ''So,'' he said, ''why not turn the decision around, bring the smaller guys up and give them the promotion they can't get anywhere else?'' He said that music from some 240 artists was used on Amped, that in the game the names of the record labels are shown on banners and that players had the option of seeing names of the bands, songs and record labels. He added that the company hoped to stage more promotions with the music. But there is no guarantee that gamers will hear much if any of the music of these bands. That is because in a feature unique to the Xbox consumers have the option of wiping out the soundtrack to a game and replacing it with music from their own CD's. Originally music executives were less worried about artists not getting paid than about the potential for Xbox to become a new Napster, since it has a large hard drive and online capabilities. But in a statement prepared for this article Microsoft said that though music could be stored on the hard drive, it could not be copied on ''CD's, MP3's or any other devices.'' Other executives in the music publishing business now worry that video game manufacturers and even advertising agencies will follow Microsoft's lead and tell bands that in exchange for use of their music at no cost, an extra effort will be made to promote the groups in products and commercials. As it is, artists sacrifice a lot of money and time at the altar of promotion, taking on costly and inconvenient tasks gratis, like performing concerts promoted by radio stations. So, some wonder, in a field in which just about anything musicians do can be seen as raising their profiles, where is the line between promotional and paid work? Jeff Koz, the chief executive of SubZero, a company that brokers deals between advertisers and musicians, said, ''We believe that people should be paid for what they do.'' Mr. Koz has worked with Microsoft on music and sound design. He added, however, that there was a give-and-take between payment and promotion, and lesser-known artists were often given somewhat lower fees in exchange for what could be career-enhancing exposure. ''There's value to cross-promotion,'' he said, ''and we're not privy to how those Microsoft deals went down. Some of those bands might see it as a tremendous opportunity.'' No. 1 and Dropping The new Britney Spears album, ''Britney,'' will enter the pop charts next week at No. 1 with 769,000 copies sold, according to Soundscan, a company that tracks retail sales. The number, a significant drop from the first-week sales of her previous album (1.3 million), reflects a teenage pop demand that is slipping but still hanging on tenaciously as Ms. Spears sagely remakes her image so she has one foot in the teenage world and the other in the general pop market (an approach best summed up by her song title ''I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman''). The following week, record executives say, ''Britney'' seems likely to slip to No. 2 when the Garth Brooks album ''Scarecrow'' makes its debut with predicted sales of more than one million copies."

                "LOS ANGELES — Microsoft, seeking to expand offerings on its Xbox 360 console, has reached an agreement with a company headed by Peter Safran, the veteran Hollywood producer and talent manager, to produce original shows for distribution on the system. Through his Safran Co., he represents clients like the actor and producer Sean Combs (\"Monster's Ball\"), the actor and writer Nia Vardalos (\"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\") and the filmmakers Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer (\"Epic Movie\"). Safran founded the company in 2006 after leaving Brillstein-Grey Management. Speaking by telephone last week, Scott Nocas, global marketing manager for programming of the Xbox Live entertainment service, said he expected similar deals to follow. \"We definitely look at this as the first of many,\" said Nocas. In an interview at his office in Los Angeles last week, Safran said his first round of programs would be scripted and would probably run under 10 minutes. He said his initial focus would be on genres like comedy and horror that appeal to the Xbox 360 audience, which is heavily concentrated from the ages of 14 to 34, and tends to be more male than female. The first shows are expected to be available to viewers by autumn in the Northern Hemisphere. \"The Xbox is unique; it operates at a level outside of what we generally consider Web entertainment,\" Safran said, referring to the system's tight demographic base, which is defined by the appeal of signature games like the Halo series. The new shows will be available exclusively via the Xbox 360 for a time, then may appear elsewhere, Safran said."

                "Looking for an advantage in the next round of the video-console wars, Microsoft has made the first move. Three and a half years after it entered the console market with the Xbox, Microsoft yesterday unveiled its successor, the Xbox 360, a creamy white console that is to go on sale in North America, Europe and Japan by the holiday season. Though noticeably smaller than its squat black predecessor, the console houses three 3.2-gigahertz I.B.M. microprocessors that could qualify it as the most powerful home computer on the market. Indeed, unlike the original Xbox, the new console can act as a home entertainment hub, streaming pictures, music and video from digital cameras, portable music players and computers that run Microsoft Windows XP. Most evidently different, Xbox 360, which Microsoft introduced last night in a 30-minute presentation on MTV, is designed to display games in wide-screen, high-definition format as well as in standard definition. Microsoft's move, after years of secrecy, rumors and fragmentary disclosures, comes as its competitors -- Sony, the undisputed industry leader, and Nintendo, a close third worldwide -- are also preparing presentations of their coming consoles for the Electronic Entertainment Expo, a major industry trade show, in Los Angeles next week. Representatives of those companies said their game systems, Sony's PlayStation 3 and Nintendo's, which is code-named Revolution, are set for release next year. For the game industry, with $10 billion a year in sales in the United States alone, the consoles' arrivals will not only give rise to new demand for game hardware but will set off a new wave of game development and purchases. As the consoles put new emphasis on high-definition video, they may stimulate TV sales as well. One analyst, describing the anticipation surrounding the announcements, said it was as if Detroit released a new line of automobiles only once every four or five years. \"The business is getting bigger, the stakes are getting higher, and there is such a big leap in technology, potentially making the games ever more realistic and involving,\" said Anita Frazier, entertainment industry analyst for NPD Funworld. Microsoft did not disclose the pricing of its new console. Since their introductions, the current Xbox and Sony's PlayStation 2 have dropped in price from $300 to $150 in the United States; Nintendo's GameCube, originally $200, is now $100. When Xbox arrived in 2001, it was heralded as the most powerful of the consoles and had innovations including a built-in hard drive and an Ethernet port for online play. The machine's biggest hits have been the Halo games, published by Microsoft itself; Halo 2, released last fall, has sold 6.3 million copies. Xbox has also developed a following among game developers, who have been drawn to its power. Still, even with 20 million consoles sold, Xbox has been far outdistanced by Sony's PlayStation 2, with sales of 80 million and 70 percent of the world market. While Halo 2's success put Microsoft's games unit in the black for one quarter last year, the Xbox effort has yet to provide sustained profitability. \"Xbox 1 was very much ready, fire, aim,\" said J Allard, corporate vice president at Microsoft and a leading architect of the Xbox effort. \"We had 19 months and a day between the day we approved the project to the day we were on store shelves.\" For the new Xbox project, Mr. Allard said his team had twice that time and aimed at conceiving a \"magical product\" that was so well integrated it would seem the creation of a single mind. In sheer computing power, the new Xbox is capable of a trillion calculations per second, many orders of magnitude above the original Xbox. (The current box depends mainly on a 733-megahertz processor.) The heat generated by all that power will be drawn off by a water-based cooling system, something usually seen only in high-end PC's. It will also include a redesigned wireless game controller. A Web camera, code-named Cyclops, and a TV-like remote control will be optional. Peter Moore, a Microsoft corporate vice president for worldwide sales and marketing, said Xbox 360 would be especially suited for wide-screen high-definition television and Digital Dolby 5.1 multichannel sound, a requirement for all Xbox 360 games. He added that the new console would also be more seamlessly integrated with Xbox Live, the service that connects games and gamers over high-speed Internet connections for multiplayer action. Xbox Live, which has 1.4 million subscribers, will include a new tier that waives the $6 monthly fee. A demonstration of the console's power delivered stunningly realistic scenes that were indistinguishable at some points from live-action video. \"We have to continue to feed that core audience,\" Robert J. Bach, senior vice president and chief Xbox officer at Microsoft, said of the most ardent gamers. \"But part of the challenge of this next generation is how do we cultivate a broader mass audience.\" Part of that strategy, he said, includes designing Xbox 360 to perform a range of nongaming functions suited to the living room, like streaming digital music and pictures, or videoconferencing. In addition to playing DVD's, as the current Xbox does, it can rip songs from CD's onto a 20-gigabyte hard drive -- a hard drive that can be removed, upgraded and interchanged with other 360 consoles. Judging by dozens of Web sites dedicated to interest in next-generation consoles, expectations are soaring that Xbox 360's competitors will also provide vastly improved graphics, sound and game playing. For example, it is widely believed that Sony's PlayStation 3, which will use a new cell processor technology, will be the most powerful. Molly Smith, a Sony spokeswoman, would not discuss hardware specifics of the PlayStation 3. But she did say that it would be able to deliver \"a quantum leap\" in gaming and electronic entertainment. Nintendo, struggling to shed an image that its technologies mostly appeal to children, is preparing to deliver a game console that is radically different from the cute and cuddly GameCube. Perrin Kaplan, Nintendo's vice president for corporate affairs, said GameCube's successor would be \"very, very sleek.\" She described it as horizontal and no taller than a stack of three DVD cases. Unlike GameCube, the new system will play DVD's, Ms. Kaplin said, and will feature a wireless controller. It will play GameCube games as well as a new class of high-definition games, with new emphasis on online play. Microsoft would not say whether games for the current Xbox would play on Xbox 360. Some industry analysts and game developers said it was likely that games for all three consoles would increase to $60 or $65; the typical price for premium titles on the current machines is $50. \"Over all, the introduction of the next-generation systems will have a very positive impact on the video game industry,\" said Will Kassoy, vice president for global brand management at Activision, a game publisher. \"They will expand the user base and grow software sales.\" Historically, he said, each new cycle of consoles has ushered in a 30 percent rise in the number of players. \"We believe this next generation will see similar growth,\" Mr. Kassoy said. Activision is scheduled to have four games for Xbox 360 at the start, including some of the company's best-selling series -- Tony Hawk, Call to Duty and Quake. Simon Jeffery, president of Sega, said his company would have two titles for Xbox 360 for the holiday season -- Condemned: Criminal Origins and Full Auto -- emphasizing that they will take advantage of the new console's increased power. \"Every successive jump in technology affords new elements of games,\" he said. \"We now will have processing power to do things we haven't been able to do before.\""

                "Sending voice and Webcam picture messages to fellow Xbox 360 players over Microsoft’s Xbox Live service is a cinch, but tapping out old-fashioned text messages using the 360’s onscreen keyboard isn’t much fun. A new $30 miniature keyboard called the Chatpad speeds up text entry to let you best even the fastest BlackBerry touch-typists.  The Chatpad, to go on sale Sept. 6, attaches to the underside of the 360’s controller without interfering with the controller’s comfortable feel in the hands. A backlight makes typing during late-night Gears of War campaigns easier on the eyes, and a dedicated Messenger button activates the 360’s instant messaging program so you can taunt your enemies without breaking from the action. Unfortunately you can’t use the keyboard to type a letter and jump to the corresponding spot in long lists of Xbox Live movie downloads or songs stored on an iPod connected to the 360. Instead, you need to hold down the scroll button. Albert Penello, director for global marketing for Xbox, said the company was looking into a way to add this feature. "

                "FORGET horsepower, forget miles per gallon: the key metric for judging the Nissan Urge, a design study to be introduced today at the North American International Automobile Show in Detroit, is polygons per second, an index of performance for video games. Five hundred million polygons a second is the rating for the Microsoft Xbox 360 video game system tucked away in the car's trunk. It pumps out images fast enough to generate dizzyingly sharp scenes of city streets and speeding cars on a display that folds down from above the windshield. The Urge's key trick is that when parked, its steering wheel and pedals can be used to control the Xbox. The game's soundtrack of roaring engines and screeching tires play through the car's speakers to accompany the action on the screen. Many cars have had video game displays installed in their dashboards. The Urge is the first car to be turned into a game controller -- the tail is now wagging the dog. The Urge, created at Nissan Design America in the La Jolla section of San Diego, is another of the auto industry's seemingly endless quests for \"echo boomer\" customers, a coterie that for carmakers gleams over the horizon the way the mythical city of Eldorado did for the conquistadors. In part, the Urge is a response to an online survey, said John Cupit, a design manager for Nissan. Mr. Cupit interpreted the survey results in the bare, exposed look of the Urge, an articulation of the car's parts aimed, he said, at giving the feel of a motorcycle. The fenders and structure, mostly aluminum, stand out as separate parts. The engine -- a piece of the car so unimportant in this case that Nissan did not even provide the usual specifications of horsepower and torque -- is visible beneath a transparent hood. Nissan calls the look \"minimalism to the maximum.\" The bottoms of the doors are cut away, revealing a surrounding frame of aluminum rendered in \"acid yellow,\" which Anka Mazzei, the color designer, said she chose to express intensity and speed. The front end of the Urge is similar to the GT-R Proto, a concept that Nissan unveiled at the Tokyo auto show last fall. But one should not take the exterior of the Urge too literally. Its weirdness signals that it is unlikely to become a production vehicle. What counts is the concept. Urge is an implicit response to cultural change: young buyers have proved more fascinated by the innovations of their new cellphones, hand-held devices and video games than by the automotive advances that captivated their parents. The showcase game for the Xbox 360 is a special edition of Project Gotham Racing, one of the hit titles for the original Xbox as well. Mr. Cupit said that he and his colleagues at the La Jolla studio spend a lot of time playing on a huge plasma screen. The project was a joint effort with Microsoft, so the Xbox 360 beneath the boattail- shape trunk, one of a half-million consoles shipped since the game system went on sale Nov. 22, is different from the others: no one stood in line to buy it. Video gaming is not the only technology incorporated into the Urge. In addition to the Xbox 360, there is an iPod docking station and a cellphone that doubles as a \"smart key\" to start the engine. In at least one respect, the Urge might be the perfect car: it burns no gasoline while parked for game playing; it generates no emissions; it lines up in no traffic jams. It can virtually roll through the streets of Las Vegas or spin around the Nürburgring. Its version of Gotham Racing can even run uptown on the parts of Broadway that are one-way heading downtown, a special thrill for Manhattan drivers. With a wireless connection, in theory, two Urges could be parked side-by-side for competition like the old racing games at the arcade in Atlantic City. Thanks to the Internet, the same thing could be done even if the Urges were half a world apart. The game encourages stylish driving. Good driving through the curves earns the driver style points, called Kudos, that can be redeemed for a better vehicle. According to the Microsoft programmers, power sliding, pulling off a 360-degree spin, getting air time, drafting and getting up on two wheels \"will earn gamers Kudos points for their style and skill.\" Too bad the real automotive world doesn't work this way. Each car in the game is made up of 80,000 polygons and takes eight days of programming by its creators, who are holed up in the London studio of Bizarre Creations. Real-world details include gauges that move and realistic bug-smash streaks on the windshield. Oddly, the Urge itself is not among the cars you can drive on the screen. That will probably be remedied soon. Project Gotham players and programmers regularly produce new cars that can be downloaded. The Urge's notion of car-as-video game is not unprecedented. A similar concept, the Scion Speedster -- a red Scion xA show car built by 5 Axis Productions in Huntington Beach, Calif. -- was displayed at the Specialty Equipment Market Association trade show in Las Vegas last fall. The Speedster also has an open panel in the doors -- and two Xboxes running the Forza racing game onboard. The two cars simply evolved at the same time, Mr. Cupit said. He prefers his version of the idea. \"We tried to take seriously designing the door glass to protect the occupants from wind and rain, and also vehicle ingress-egress,\" he said. \"Our door moves up and down to ease entry into the car, for example.\" \"We often visit tuner and customizing shows to see what young people are thinking about,\" Mr. Cupit said. \"The Urge helps reinvent the sports car for the next generation of young people.\" Observing young people at auto shows, it is impossible not to note that they pay more attention to how their cars look and sound than how fast they go. The investment tends to go into electronics and colorful bolt-on parts, rather than into making the engine run faster and more furious. Maybe more automakers should put Xboxes in their cars. General Motors and Ford might stir up interest by tucking Xbox 360's into all their trunks."

                "REDMOND, Wash. — Microsoft is betting it has a new way to win the wallets of consumers. The company on Tuesday introduced the new version of its Xbox video game console. The Xbox has been one of Microsoft’s few undeniable consumer hits of the last decade, a product that was not just a credible entry into the games business but also a sign of the innovation possible at a company that is rarely seen as an inventive thinker. “I think of Xbox as the accidental success out of Microsoft,” said James McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester Research, who added that the connection Microsoft has formed with the players of its current Xbox is “much deeper than any relationship Microsoft has ever achieved before.”  The new console, the Xbox One, will enter a market very different from the one its predecessor, the Xbox 360, entered nearly eight years ago, when there was no iPad, smartphones had keyboards and mobile gaming devices were primitive at best.  Today, video games can be played almost anywhere, on any device, with the biggest possible audience of online friends and without the aid of a costly gaming console. The last year or two has been bumpy for Microsoft’s consumer efforts. The Windows 8 operating system software and the Surface tablet-computing devices got a tepid reception from the public when they went on sale last fall.  The company’s mobile phone efforts have been largely ignored. And even Bing, Microsoft’s Internet search engine, has failed to close a wide gap with Google, the market leader.  Microsoft, though, could see better results with the Xbox. With it, it hopes it can reassert the living room as the place where people can still get the best gaming experience, complete with eye-popping graphics and innovative methods for controlling games. It is also a place where Microsoft’s technology can be at the center of a home entertainment system and the funnel through which people gain access to online video. Microsoft has sold more than 76 million of the device’s current incarnation, the Xbox 360 worldwide, compared with almost 100 million Wii consoles from Nintendo and more than 70 million PlayStation 3s from Sony.  The company also controls what may be the most valuable asset in console gaming, Xbox Live, a subscription-based online service with 48 million members who use it to play games against one another and watch movies.  “You can do a lot of things on the phone and a lot of things on tablets,” said John Taylor, an analyst at Arcadia Investment. But, he said, “you can’t do the same kinds of things on those devices” that you can on a television screen. Microsoft plans to develop its own original, live-action television series, which will be accessible through the Xbox. The series will be made in partnership with the director Steven Spielberg and will be based on the popular Halo video game franchise.  The company is also working with the National Football League to develop an app for Xbox that lets players interact with their fantasy football teams while watching a live game. In an interview, Don A. Mattrick, the president of Microsoft’s interactive entertainment business, said that he recognized the growing appeal of mobile devices for gaming and that Microsoft would aggressively tie smartphones and tablets into the experience of using its console. He became most animated when talking about the possibilities of the new Xbox for providers of video programming. “We’re going to the take the form from a one-way experience pushed through a straw to where you can communicate back and make it interactive,” Mr. Mattrick said.  Even if it is a wild success, the new Xbox is likely to have a bigger impact on consumer perception than it will on Microsoft’s overall sales. The Xbox remains a small slice of the company’s business, which is still dominated by sales of Windows, Office and other software. The company’s games division represented only 4 percent of its operating profit. At an event in a carnival tent on its corporate campus, Microsoft did not say how much the new system would cost or how publishing partners would charge for games, which typically start at around $60 for high-end game consoles.  A major feature of the new Xbox, which is expected to hit store shelves in time for the holiday season, will be a new generation of Kinect, the camera-based motion-control sensor introduced several years ago as an Xbox 360 accessory. The new Kinect will come with every Xbox One. Traditional retail sales of games have come under pressure in recent years as mobile devices like the iPhone and iPad have invaded their turf with free and low-cost games. While many gamers dismiss those offerings as inferior to console games, the games have nevertheless tapped into a huge audience of players who may never have played on an Xbox or Sony’s PlayStation. The games business could use a jolt. Total United States retail sales of game hardware and software fell 25 percent to $495.2 million in April from $657.5 million a year earlier, according to estimates by NPD Group, a research firm. That figure does not include the sale of downloadable content over the Internet. Alex St. John, an entrepreneur who worked on Microsoft’s pre-Xbox game efforts, says he is pessimistic about prospects for gaming consoles. “They’re coming out with the latest and greatest stone tool,” Mr. St. John said. “The new console that trumps the old console is called the Apple iPad. This generation of kids loves mobile games.”"

                "Three months after surprising the video game industry with strong sales of its first console, the Microsoft Corporation will dispatch its chairman, Bill Gates, to Tokyo this week to introduce its assault on an inhospitable Japanese market. Not since the industry's early days, when Atari competed for space in video arcades, has a major American game company tried to dethrone Japanese hardware makers on their own turf. When it begins selling its Xbox game system in Japan on Friday, Microsoft will try to use the star power of Mr. Gates and a lineup of specialized games to battle the leaders, Sony and Nintendo. Many industry insiders predict that the Xbox, which has sold more than 1.5 million units in North America since November, will face tough going in Japan, where American software companies have found tremendous difficulties merely putting their games onto store shelves. ''You are talking about a closed market and going up against two very strong, very entrenched competitors,'' said Heath A. Terry, a game software analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston. ''For Microsoft to expect significant success early on in that market is unrealistic.'' The Xbox has other strikes against it for Japanese consumers, who buy about a third of the world's game products. Analysts worry that the console is too big for the living room in a country where smaller gadgets rule. And at about $260, the Xbox costs $40 more than Sony's PlayStation2 and $75 more than Nintendo's GameCube. Yet analysts and software makers acknowledge that Microsoft, the world's No. 1 software company, managed the North American rollout of the Xbox better than they had expected. They also noted that it has deep pockets and has shown unflagging persistence in entering other businesses. The company has already made one significant adjustment specifically for Japan: after criticism from early testers, it built smaller game controllers, with buttons closer together, to better fit the hands of the average Japanese player. Peter Moore, president and chief operating officer for Sega of America, the American division of the Japanese games publisher, said Microsoft's early success in North America gave the company a fighting chance in Japan and Europe, where the Xbox goes on sale on March 14. ''It's eerily reminiscent of the power of the launch of the PlayStation,'' he said, referring to Sony's first console. ''The way a powerful global company can attack an industry, get under its skin and change an industry.'' Hirohisa Ohura, who runs Microsoft's Xbox division in Japan, said the North American introduction had proved that the company could compete in the video game business. While calling Japan ''the most challenging market'' for the Xbox, he said Microsoft would keep chipping away at its competitors for the loyalty of Japanese game players. ''U.S. companies coming into Japan as a game vendor tended to fail and walk away real quick,'' Mr. Ohura said. ''We're not willing to give up at any point. Once we're in this business, we're in here to win.'' In its quest for the buzz that makes or breaks video games, Microsoft set up hundreds of Xbox kiosks in Tokyo and Osaka earlier this month. And for the introduction on Friday, Mr. Gates himself will stump for the Xbox at an event similar to his appearance last November at the opening of the Toys ''R'' Us store in Times Square. Microsoft began taking advance orders on Feb. 2 for consoles, including 50,000 special edition systems with a translucent case and a silver-plated key chain engraved with the autograph of Mr. Gates -- an accessory that has been mocked on online message boards and game publications. Sony, the consumer electronics giant, has an enormous head start on Microsoft. By Dec. 31, Sony said, it had shipped 25 million of its next-generation consoles, the PlayStation2, including 10 million to North America and 8 million to Japan. ''The burden isn't on our company to compete with them; the burden is significantly on Microsoft to compete with us,'' said Molly Smith, a spokeswoman for Sony Computer Entertainment America, the company's American division. The list of best-selling software is dominated by titles that run on the PlayStation2. Yet while they have capitalized on Sony's success in North America, large American game publishers have found the Japanese market difficult to penetrate and have been forced to cooperate with Japanese publishers to develop games specifically for Japan and have games sold there. Electronic Arts is the No. 1 publisher of PlayStation2 titles in North America, but only No. 7 in Japan. ''The secret in Japan is getting product that's culturally appealing to Japanese consumers,'' said Stan McKee, chief financial officer of Electronic Arts. Microsoft has forged partnerships of its own with more than 90 Japanese publishers, but still faces an uphill battle. Because of Sony's lead, analysts said, Microsoft will consider its introduction a success if it wins close to 20 percent of the Japanese market."

                "Reaching out to millions of aspiring game developers around the world, Microsoft plans today to announce a contest that will award $10,000 and the opportunity to entice millions of eyeballs to the next great digital diversion for the company’s Xbox 360. In addition to the game console’s snazzy graphics, the Xbox Live online service has been the most important component of the Xbox 360’s success since its debut in 2005. And perhaps the most popular aspect of Xbox Live has been the service’s arcade component, which allows users to download and play smaller, relatively simpler games like Uno and Geometry Wars that usually cost less than $10. (By contrast, top-end games can sell in stores for around $60.) The popularity of Xbox Live Arcade has in turn attracted the attention of game developers looking to create the next Tetris or Minesweeper. Late last year, Microsoft introduced a suite of software tools for making so-called casual games called XNA.  And so at a game makers’ convention in San Francisco, Microsoft plans to announce a contest akin to the television show “Project Greenlight” that will award a cash prize and a potential slot on Xbox Live Arcade to the best new game created with XNA tools. The company intends to announce the winner of the contest, called “Dream-Build-Play,” in August.  “This competition highlights the power of XNA and the popularity of the Xbox Live Arcade service with its millions of users,” Aaron Greenberg, Microsoft’s group product manager for the Xbox 360 and Xbox Live, said in a telephone interview.  To help increase the popularity of casual games, Microsoft will also announce the introduction of a new 512-megabyte portable storage device for the Xbox 360. The previous portable storage unit contained only 64 megabytes of data, and so Xbox Live Arcade games had been limited to an official size of 50 megabytes. With the new unit, Microsoft will also raise the official size limit on Xbox Live Arcade games to 150 megabytes, allowing enhanced graphics, sound and artificial intelligence. SETH SCHIESEL"

                "Raising the ante in the video game wars, Microsoft is bringing out a new version of the Xbox 360 game machine that has a bigger hard drive, better high-definition video support and a stylish black finish, not an insignificant feature in a world where looking cool ranks high. The idea is to appeal to an elite class of hardcore game players who would like a little more of everything.   “Today’s games-and-entertainment enthusiast has an insatiable appetite for digital high-definition content,” said Peter Moore, corporate vice president for Microsoft’s interactive entertainment business, in Redmond, Wash.   The Xbox 360 Elite, which is to be announced today and will be in stores in late April, will have a list price of $479, or $80 more than the Xbox 360 Pro and $180 more than the basic Xbox 360. The new model has a 120-gigabyte hard drive, in contrast to the standard model’s 20-gigabyte drive. It also has a high-definition multimedia interface port and cable and a wireless controller and headset. Current Xbox 360 owners can buy the new 120-gigabyte hard drive as a separate accessory for $179.  Microsoft is clearly hoping to fill what it sees as a hole at the top end of the market. The Nintendo Wii has been outselling the PlayStation 3 from Sony and the Xbox 360 in recent months, but that system is largely positioned as a family-friendly game machine that can be purchased for $50 less than the lowest-priced Xbox. The Sony system is priced higher than both the Nintendo and the Microsoft systems, with the cheapest model priced at $499.  Both Microsoft and Sony have positioned their consoles as entertainment hubs, not just for playing sophisticated video games but also for listening to music and viewing downloaded movies and television shows.   John Rodman, group product manager for the Xbox platform and Xbox Live, pointed to a recent Microsoft survey that revealed that nearly 40 percent of the time that Xbox 360 users spent with their consoles was for activities other than gaming.   Yet when it comes to gaming, Xbox 360 users are serious, Mr. Rodman says. Six out of 10 Xbox 360 users use Xbox Live, Microsoft’s online gaming service.   “We don’t feel like the Wii customer and the Xbox customer are the same thing,” he said. “We think that as soon as the Wii customer turns 14 they want something else.”  James L. McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester Research, said that Microsoft hoped to encourage customers to spend more money downloading movies and games, which require considerable hard-drive space. "

                "WASHINGTON — In late January, as China locked down some provinces to contain the spread of the coronavirus, average internet speeds in the country slowed as people who were stuck inside went online more and clogged the networks. In Hubei Province, the epicenter of infections, mobile broadband speeds fell by more than half. In mid-February, when the virus hit Italy, Germany and Spain, internet speeds in those countries also began to deteriorate. And last week, as a wave of stay-at-home orders rolled out across the United States, the average time it took to download videos, emails and documents increased as broadband speeds declined 4.9 percent from the previous week, according to Ookla, a broadband speed testing service. Median download speeds dropped 38 percent in San Jose, Calif., and 24 percent in New York, according to Broadband Now, a consumer broadband research site. Quarantines around the world have made people more reliant on the internet to communicate, work, learn and stay entertained. But as the use of YouTube, Netflix, Zoom videoconferencing, Facebook calls and videogaming has surged to new highs, the stress on internet infrastructure is starting to show in Europe and the United States — and the traffic is probably far from its peak. “This is totally unprecedented,” said Thierry Breton, a European Union commissioner who oversees digital policy and was a chief executive of France Télécom. “We have to be proactive.” To head off problems, European regulators like Mr. Breton have pushed streaming companies such as Netflix and YouTube to reduce the size of their video files so they don’t take up as much bandwidth. In the United States, regulators have given wireless carriers access to more spectrum to bolster the capacity of their networks. Some tech companies have responded to the call to ease internet traffic. YouTube, which is owned by Google, said this week that it would reduce the quality of its videos from high to standard definition across the globe. Disney delayed the start of its Disney Plus streaming service in France by two weeks, and Microsoft’s Xbox asked gaming companies to introduce online updates and new releases only at certain times to prevent network congestion. “We really don’t know how long we’re going to be in this mode for,” Dave Temkin, Netflix’s vice president of network and systems infrastructure, said in a webinar on Wednesday on how the coronavirus could affect internet infrastructure. Internet service providers like Comcast, Vodafone, Verizon and Telefónica have been building out their networks for years to account for increasing demand. But company officials said they had never seen such a steep, sudden surge. Growth that the industry had expected to take a year is happening over days, said Enrique Blanco, the chief technology officer at Telefónica, a Spanish telecommunications company. “In just two days we grew all the traffic we had planned for 2020,” Mr. Blanco said. On Monday, traffic on AT&T’s networks was up 27 percent compared to the same day last month, and last week Verizon experienced a 22 percent increase in traffic on its wireless and fiber broadband service. Wi-Fi calls doubled from their normal volume, the carriers said. In Europe, internet traffic into homes over fixed lines was up more than 30 percent, according to Telefónica. Activities like online gaming and video conferencing have more than doubled, while messages over WhatsApp have more than quadrupled. So much traffic and stress on internet networks has slowed the speed of downloading web pages and apps, according to Ookla. “Congestion is higher,” said Adriane Blum, an Ookla spokeswoman. “We’re all at home, and the activities we’re doing in this unprecedented time are not low-bandwidth usage, which means a lot of activity on a network.” Cisco said demand for its WebEx teleconference service had tracked the spread of the coronavirus. Demand first surged in Asia, then in Europe, and last week it soared 240 percent in the United States. The demand has pushed up failure rates delivering video conferencing, said Sri Srinivasan, a Cisco senior vice president in charge of WebEx. “I don’t know if we’ll soon see a peak, not for weeks to come,” he said. “The reason I say that is because we aren’t seeing traffic in Asia slow down even now.” Internet service providers said they could handle the deluge of traffic but were adding capacity. Verizon, Cox and AT&T said they were building more cell sites to strengthen mobile networks, increasing the number of fiber connections on their network backbones, and upgrading the routing and switching technology that lets devices talk to one another and share an internet connection. Orange, formerly France Télécom, has doubled its capacity inside undersea internet cables. In Italy, where home internet use is up 90 percent, Telecom Italia said its technicians continued to make repairs and add capacity. Vodafone, one of Europe’s largest networks operators, said it had increased its capacity 50 percent in recent weeks through a mix of software and the addition of more equipment in the field. “We’re seeing some signs of stress,” AT&T’s chief executive, Randall Stephenson, said in an interview on CNN on Sunday. “We’re having to go out and do some augmentation of networks, and so we’re sending our employees out there to get that done, but right now the network is performing quite well.” To prevent clogged networks, Europe has taken the most aggressive steps. Last week, Mr. Breton, the European Union commissioner, discussed reducing the bitstreams of videos with Reed Hastings, the chief executive of Netflix; Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Google; and Susan Wojcicki, the head of YouTube. The companies agreed, as did Amazon for its Prime Video streaming service and Twitch, its online gaming platform. Many of the companies then went further. On Tuesday, Netflix decided to switch its high-definition video streams in India, Australia and Latin America to slightly lower quality to reduce the traffic they create there by 25 percent, and YouTube said it would make all global streams standard definition. “We continue to work closely with governments and network operators around the globe to do our part to minimize stress on the system during this unprecedented situation,” YouTube said in a statement. Microsoft’s Xbox gaming business recently asked large gaming companies to release online updates of their games during off-peak hours while it helped focus on the critical internet needs of people involved in the coronavirus crisis, according to an Xbox email reviewed by The New York Times. Video game updates can require great amounts of bandwidth to download. Xbox asked the companies to release updates in a four-hour overnight window in North America, and only from Monday through Thursday. “Microsoft is actively monitoring performance and usage trends to ensure we’re optimizing service for our customers worldwide, and accommodating new growth and demand,” the company said. “At the same time, these are unprecedented times, and we’re also taking proactive steps to plan for these high-usage periods.” While U.S. regulators said they did not plan to follow Europe in asking for streaming and social media companies to degrade their services, they are taking other steps. Last week, the Federal Communications Commission granted Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile temporary access to more airwaves. “The F.C.C. has been coordinating closely with network operators to ensure those networks remain up and running,” Ajit Pai, the agency’s chairman, said in a statement. Telefónica’s Mr. Blanco, who has been living under a lockdown in Spain, said he expected the record traffic to last for some time. It may even become the new normal, he said. In Spain, internet use drops only at 8 p.m., when people across the country go to their windows to cheer health workers and others who are helping to manage the crisis. “Suddenly at 8 p.m. it goes down, then it goes back up,” Mr. Blanco said. “It’s a beautiful thing.” Cecilia Kang reported from Washington, Davey Alba from New York and Adam Satariano from London. Karen Weise contributed reporting from Seattle."

                "The last time I was unemployed was in the depths of the Great Recession. I had recently moved in with my girlfriend, who suddenly found herself with an out-of-work partner who rarely left the house. But she gave me some surprising advice: Play video games. I would have a lot of time on my hands, she said, and while I could and should certainly do other things — housework, exercise, searching for a job — I would mostly be stuck at home with limited resources. Without something to occupy my mind, I’d go crazy. She was right. Playing video games helped ease my mind, elevate my mood and possibly saved our relationship. This year we’ll celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary. So now I’m going to give the same advice to anyone who is now out of work, or otherwise kept at home: Play video games. And don’t feel bad about it. If you’re not a gamer, you might think of video games as simple time-wasters. But for those stuck mostly inside without work, killing time is a real problem. And in the world of big-budget console games, 10 to 15 hours is a fairly short experience. Some can take hundreds of hours to complete. There are online games designed to be played and replayed for thousands of hours. But games are more than just empty time-wasters. In periods of pain, boredom or personal emptiness, video games can serve as palliative care for both the body and the mind. Think of gaming as a personal stimulus plan for a nation of unexpected shut-ins: It’s not a long-term solution, it won’t work for everyone, and it won’t solve the underlying problems — but it can provide limited, temporary relief for some. Video games take many forms, but they are all essentially simulations. And when the real world is temporarily unavailable, a simulated version might be what we need. Among other things, video games simulate work: Even the simplest games give players tasks, objectives, lists of things they have to do, problems to solve and a sense of accomplishment upon completion. And the biggest modern games offer seemingly endless lists of quests and objectives, tasks and subtasks, systems to learn and skills to be mastered. A game like the online shooter Destiny 2 offers hundreds, if not thousands, of hours of play, exploration and study. Set in an intricately designed sci-fi world, it tasks players with taking out wave after wave of alien enemies. It also rewards them for understanding a complex character progression system that involves completing ever-more-difficult goals and objectives, sometimes multiple times, in exchange for rarer and more powerful weapons and armor. You might not actually accomplish anything after a day spent checking off quests and gathering virtual materials, but you’ll feel like you did. Game critics have noted the worklike nature of many modern games for years, not always favorably. But in a world of stay-at-home mass unemployment, even the illusion of accomplishment is probably better than none at all. Indeed, the particular shut-in nature of our current crisis makes video games unusually relevant in a different way: What video games do better than any other medium is simulate places. Open-world games like Skyrim, Red Dead Redemption II or The Witcher 3 are built around giant, explorable spaces, sometimes the virtual equivalent of hundreds of square miles, with elaborate geography and shifting weather. They can take days or weeks to fully explore and at their best can be unexpectedly beautiful, offering the opportunity to encounter animated versions of sun-dappled vistas or foggy mountain peaks, to wander through crowded city streets or stroll past others on well-trod footpaths. Games can give us someplace else to go. That makes games useful in another way. Some of us are shut in alone. But especially in cities, many are now effectively trapped inside modest apartments with family or roommates, and little private space. Games offer a form of personal escape, a way to simulate being elsewhere from the confines of your couch. And for those who are alone, games can also serve as social spaces, virtual fields of play for cooperative adventures or competitive contests. Many of today’s most popular games are online experiences that allow players to engage with friends as well as strangers, to forge digital versions of the same sort of bonds with teammates that can develop in the real world. If you’re new at this, the cost of entry is fairly low: There are thousands of high-quality games available for phones, and many more available to download directly to your computer. Even better, many big-budget games are free if you have a computer or game console on which to play them. Late last year, Destiny 2, released in 2017 as a full-priced game, reinvented itself as a free-to-play experience, with the base game available at no cost (players can pay for expansions). Several of the “battle royale” games that have defined the new wave of first-person shooters are also free: A relatively well-reviewed recent entry, Call of Duty: Warzone, offers several clever twists on the popular last-player-standing formula. Not everyone wants to play online shooters, but for those willing to spend a little there are now subscription services that offer access to a large library of games for an annual or monthly fee. For little more than the price of a standard Netflix plan, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate offers access to dozens of games, from moody, philosophical puzzle games like The Talos Principle to richly animated platformers like Ori and the Will of the Wisps. There are sports games, strategy games, role-playing games and simple twitchy diversions that recall the arcade games I pumped quarters into as a kid. And for those who not satisfied with our current quasi-apocalypse, there even games about viral outbreaks and attacks, from the strategic epidemic simulator Plague Inc., to the deftly scripted post-pandemic action game The Last of Us, to The Division 2, a military thriller set in emptied-out recreations of downtown Washington and New York after a viral bioweapon wipes out most of the population. Maybe that one hits a little too close to home. Yes, games are frivolous. Yes, they are escapist. But the longer the coronavirus keeps social life and culture in isolation, the more we’ll need frivolity and escapism. There’s a limit, of course, to what video games can do: They can’t serve as long-term substitutes for real places, real work or real human interaction. But they can give us a simulacrum of all those things at a time when the real ones are in short supply, and tide us over until the world we actually need returns.

                "Like many young hipsters in Austin, Tex., Michael Burns wanted to make it big in some creative field -- perhaps writing comedy scripts in Hollywood. Instead, he wound up in a dead-end job, managing a call center. To kill time, he made friends with a group of equally clever and bored young men at the company where he worked, and they'd sit around talking about their shared passion: video games. Their favorite title was Halo, a best-selling Xbox game in which players control armor-clad soldiers as they wander through gorgeous coastal forests and grim military bunkers and fight an army of lizardlike aliens. Burns and his gang especially loved the \"team versus team\" mode, which is like a digital version of paint ball: instead of fighting aliens, players hook their Xboxes to the Internet, then log on together in a single game, at which point they assemble into two teams -- red-armored soldiers versus blue-armored ones. Instead of shooting aliens, they try to slaughter one another, using grenades, machine guns and death rays. On evenings and weekends, Burns and his friends would cluster around their TV's until the wee hours of the morning, gleefully blowing one another to pieces. \"Halo is like crack,\" Burns recalls thinking. \"I could play it until I die.\" Whenever a friend discovered a particularly cool stunt inside Halo -- for example, obliterating an enemy with a new type of grenade toss -- Burns would record a video of the stunt for posterity. (His friend would perform the move after Burns had run a video cord from his TV to his computer, so he could save it onto his hard drive.) Then he'd post the video on a Web site to show other gamers how the trick was done. To make the videos funnier, sometimes Burns would pull out a microphone and record a comedic voice-over, using video-editing software to make it appear as if the helmeted soldier himself were doing the talking. Then one day he realized that the videos he was making were essentially computer-animated movies, almost like miniature emulations of \"Finding Nemo\" or \"The Incredibles.\" He was using the game to function like a personal Pixar studio. He wondered: Could he use it to create an actual movie or TV series? Burns's group decided to give it a shot. They gathered around the Xbox at Burns's apartment, manipulating their soldiers like tiny virtual actors, bobbing their heads to look as if they were deep in conversation. Burns wrote sharp, sardonic scripts for them to perform. He created a comedy series called \"Red vs. Blue,\" a sort of sci-fi version of \"M*A*S*H.\" In \"Red vs. Blue,\" the soldiers rarely do any fighting; they just stand around insulting one another and musing over the absurdities of war, sounding less like patriotic warriors than like bored, clever video-store clerks. The first 10-minute episode opened with a scene set in Halo's bleakest desert canyon. Two red soldiers stood on their base, peering at two blue soldiers far off in the distance, and traded quips that sounded almost like a slacker disquisition on Iraq: Red Soldier: \"Why are we out here? Far as I can tell, it's just a box canyon in the middle of nowhere, with no way in or out. And the only reason we set up a red base here is because they have a blue base there. And the only reason they have a blue base over there is because we have a red base here.\" When they were done, they posted the episode on their Web site (surreptitiously hosted on computers at work). They figured maybe a few hundred people would see it and get a chuckle or two. Instead, \"Red vs. Blue\" became an instant runaway hit on geek blogs, and within a single day, 20,000 people stampeded to the Web site to download the file. The avalanche of traffic crashed the company server. \"My boss came into the office and was like, 'What the hell is going on?' \" Burns recalls. \"I looked over at the server, and it was going blink, blink, blink.\" Thrilled, Burns and his crew quickly cranked out another video, then another. They kept up a weekly production schedule, and after a few months, \"Red vs. Blue\" had, like some dystopian version of \"Friends,\" become a piece of appointment viewing. Nearly a million people were downloading each episode every Friday, writing mash notes to the creators and asking if they could buy a DVD of the collected episodes. Mainstream media picked up on the phenomenon. The Village Voice described it as \" 'Clerks' meets 'Star Wars,' \" and the BBC called it \"riotously funny\" and said it was \"reminiscent of the anarchic energy of 'South Park.' \" Burns realized something strange was going on. He and his crew had created a hit comedy show -- entirely inside a video game. Video games have not enjoyed good publicity lately. Hillary Clinton has been denouncing the violence in titles like Grand Theft Auto, which was yanked out of many stores last month amid news that players had unlocked sex scenes hidden inside. Yet when they're not bemoaning the virtual bloodshed, cultural pundits grudgingly admit that today's games have become impressively cinematic. It's not merely that the graphics are so good: the camera angles inside the games borrow literally from the visual language of film. When you're playing Halo and look up at the sun, you'll see a little \"lens flare,\" as if you were viewing the whole experience through the eyepiece of a 16-millimeter Arriflex. By using the game to actually make cinema, Burns and his crew flipped a switch that neatly closed a self-referential media loop: movies begat games that begat movies. And Burns and his crew aren't alone. Video-game aficionados have been creating \"machinima\" -- an ungainly term mixing \"machine\" and \"cinema\" and pronounced ma-SHEEN-i-ma -- since the late 90's. \"Red vs. Blue\" is the first to break out of the underground, and now corporations like Volvo are hiring machinima artists to make short promotional films, while MTV, Spike TV and the Independent Film Channel are running comedy shorts and music videos produced inside games. By last spring, Burns and his friends were making so much money from \"Red vs. Blue\" that they left their jobs and founded Rooster Teeth Productions. Now they produce machinima full time. It may be the most unlikely form of indie filmmaking yet -- and one of the most weirdly democratic. \"It's like 'The Blair Witch Project' all over again, except you don't even need a camera,\" says Julie Kanarowski, a product manager with Electronic Arts, the nation's largest video-game publisher. \"You don't even need actors.\" Back in college, Burns and another Rooster Teeth founder, Matt Hullum, wrote and produced a traditional live-action indie movie. It cost $9,000, required a full year to make and was seen by virtually no one. By contrast, the four Xboxes needed to make \"Red vs. Blue\" cost a mere $600. Each 10-minute episode requires a single day to perform and edit and is viewed by hordes of feverish video-game fans the planet over. More than just a cheap way to make an animated movie, machinima allows game players to comment directly on the pop culture they so devotedly consume. Much like \"fan fiction\" (homespun tales featuring popular TV characters) or \"mash-ups\" (music fans blending two songs to create a new hybrid), machinima is a fan-created art form. It's what you get when gamers stop blasting aliens for a second and start messing with the narrative. And God knows, there's plenty to mess with. These days, the worlds inside games are so huge and open-ended that gamers can roam anywhere they wish. Indeed, players often abandon the official goal of the game -- save the princess; vanquish the eldritch forces of evil -- in favor of merely using the virtual environment as a gigantic jungle gym. In one popular piece of Halo machinima, \"Warthog Jump,\" a player cunningly used the game to conduct a series of dazzling physics experiments. He placed grenades in precise locations beneath jeeps and troops, such that when the targets blew sky-high, they pinwheeled through the air in precise formations, like synchronized divers. Another gamer recorded a machinima movie that poked subversive fun at Grand Theft Auto. Instead of playing as a dangerous, cop-killing gangster, the player pretended he was a naïve Canadian tourist -- putting down his gun, dressing in tacky clothes and simply wandering around the game's downtown environment for hours, admiring the scenery. So what's it like to actually shoot a movie inside a game? In June, I visited the Rooster Teeth offices in Buda, Tex., a tiny Austin suburb, to observe Burns and his group as they produced a scene of \"Red vs. Blue.\" Burns, a tall, burly 32-year-old, sat in front of two huge flat-panel screens, preparing the editing software. Nearby were the two Rooster Teeth producers who would be acting on-screen: Geoff Ramsey, a scraggly-bearded 30-year-old whose arms are completely covered in tattoos of fish and skulls, and Gustavo Sorola, a gangly 27-year-old who sprawled in a beanbag chair and peered through his thick architect glasses at the day's e-mail. They were fan letters, Sorola told me, that pour in from teenagers who are as enthusiastic as they are incoherent. \"The way kids write these days,\" he said with a grimace. \"It's like someone threw up on the keyboard.\" In the script they were acting out that day, a pair of \"Red vs. Blue\" soldiers engaged in one of their typically pointless existential arguments, bickering over whether it's possible to kill someone with a toy replica of a real weapon. The Rooster Teeth crew recorded the voice-overs earlier in the day; now they were going to create the animation for the scene. Burns picked up a controller and booted up Halo on an Xbox. He would act as the camera: whatever his character saw would be recorded, from his point of view. Then Sorola and Ramsey logged into the game, teleporting in as an orange-suited and a red-suited soldier. Burns posed them near a massive concrete bunker and frowned as he scrutinized the view on the computer screen. \"Hmmmm,\" he muttered. \"We need something to frame you guys -- some sort of prop.\" He ran his character over to a nearby alien hovercraft, jumped in and parked it next to the actors. \"Sweet!\" he said. \"I like it!\" In a \"Red vs. Blue\" shoot, the actors all must follow one important rule: Be careful not to accidentally kill another actor. \"Sometimes you'll drop your controller and it unintentionally launches a grenade. It takes, like, 20 minutes for the blood splatters to dry up,\" Ramsey said. \"Totally ruins the scene.\" Finally, Burns was ready to go. He shouted, \"Action!\" and the voice-overs began playing over loudspeakers. Sorola and Ramsey acted in time with the dialogue. Acting, in this context, was weirdly minimalist. They mashed the controller joysticks with their thumbs, bobbing the soldiers' heads back and forth roughly in time with important words in each line. \"It's puppetry, basically,\" Ramsey said, as he jiggled his controller. Of all the \"Red vs. Blue\" crew members, Ramsey is renowned for his dexterity with an Xbox. When a scene calls for more than five actors onstage, he'll put another controller on the ground and manipulate it with his right foot, allowing him to perform as two characters simultaneously. As I watched, I was reminded of what initially cracked me up so much about \"Red vs. Blue\": the idea that faceless, anonymous soldiers in a video game have interior lives. It's a \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern\" conceit; \"Red vs. Blue\" is what the game characters talk about when we're not around to play with them. As it turns out, they're a bunch of neurotics straight out of \"Seinfeld.\" One recruit reveals that he chain-smokes inside his airtight armor; a sergeant tells a soldier his battle instructions are to \"scream like a woman.\" And, in a sardonic gloss on the game's endless carnage, none of the soldiers have the vaguest clue why they're fighting. Yet as I discovered, real-life soldiers are among the most ardent fans of \"Red vs. Blue.\" When I walked around the Rooster Teeth office, I found it was festooned with letters, plaques and an enormous American flag, gifts from grateful American troops, many of whom are currently stationed in Iraq. Isn't it a little astonishing, I asked Burns when the crew went out in the baking Texas sun for a break, that actual soldiers are so enamored of a show that portrays troops as inept cowards, leaders as cynical sociopaths and war itself as a supremely meaningless endeavor? Burns laughed, but said the appeal was nothing sinister. \" 'Red vs. Blue' is about downtime,\" he said. \"There's very little action, which is precisely the way things are in real life.\" \"He's right,\" Ramsey added. He himself spent five years in the army after high school. \"We'd just sit around digging ditches and threatening to kill each other all day long,\" he said. \"We were bored out of our minds.\" Perhaps the most unusual thing about machinima is that none of its creators are in jail. After all, they're gleefully plundering intellectual property at a time when the copyright wars have become particularly vicious. Yet video-game companies have been upbeat -- even exuberant -- about the legions of teenagers and artists pillaging their games. This is particularly bewildering in the case of \"Red vs. Blue,\" because Halo is made by Bungie, a subsidiary of Microsoft, a company no stranger to using a courtroom to defend its goods. What the heck is going on? As it turns out, people at Bungie love \"Red vs. Blue.\" \"We thought it was kind of brilliant,\" says Brian Jarrard, the Bungie staff member who manages interactions with fans. \"There are people out there who would never have heard about Halo without 'Red vs. Blue.' It's getting an audience outside the hardcore gaming crowd.\" Sure, Rooster Teeth ripped off Microsoft's intellectual property. But Microsoft got something in return: \"Red vs. Blue\" gave the game a whiff of countercultural coolness, the sort of grass-roots street cred that major corporations desperately crave but can never manufacture. After talking with Rooster Teeth, Microsoft agreed, remarkably, to let them use the game without paying any licensing fees at all. In fact, the company later hired Rooster Teeth to produce \"Red vs. Blue\" videos to play as advertisements in game stores. Microsoft has been so strangely solicitous that when it was developing the sequel to Halo last year, the designers actually inserted a special command -- a joystick button that makes a soldier lower his weapon -- designed solely to make it easier for Rooster Teeth to do dialogue. \"If you're playing the game, there's no reason to lower your weapon at all,\" Burns explained. \"They put that in literally just so we can shoot machinima.\" Other game companies have gone even further. Many now include editing software with their games, specifically to encourage fans to shoot movies. When Valve software released its hit game Half-Life 2 last year, it included \"Faceposer\" software so that machinima creators could tweak the facial expressions of characters. When the Sims 2 -- a sequel to the top-selling game of all time -- came out last year, its publisher, Electronic Arts, set up a Web site so that fans could upload their Sims 2 movies to show to the world. (About 8,000 people so far have done so.) Still, it's one thing for gamers to produce a jokey comedy or a music video. Can machinima actually produce a work of art -- something with serious emotional depth? A few people have tried. In China, a visual artist named Feng Mengbo used the first-person-shooter game Quake III to produce Q4U, in which the screen is filled with multiple versions of himself, killing one another. Players' relationships with constant, blood-splattering violence is a common subject in game art. Last year, the 31-year-old artist Brody Condon produced an unsettling film that consisted of nothing but shots of himself committing suicide inside 50 different video games. \"I try to come to terms with what taking your life means in these games,\" Condon says. \"I'm trying to understand, spiritually, your relationship with an avatar on the screen.\" But even machinima's biggest fans admit that the vast majority of machinima is pretty amateurish. \"It's like if some friends of mine all broke into a movie set, and we all got to use all the cameras and special-effects equipment,\" says Carl Goodman, director of digital media at the American Museum of the Moving Image, which began to hold an annual machinima festival two years ago. \"We wouldn't quite know how to use it, but we'd make some pretty interesting stuff.\" Yet as Goodman points out, there's a competing proposition. Machinima does not always strive to emulate \"realistic,\" artistic movies. On the contrary, it is often explicitly devoted to celebrating the aesthetics of games -- the animations and in-jokes, the precise physics. Most machinima is probably meaningless to people who don't play games, much as ESPN is opaque to anyone who doesn't watch sports. But for those who do play Halo, it was genuinely thrilling to see something like \"Warthog Jump,\" with its meticulously synchronized explosions. The Rooster Teeth crew has its own hilariously stringent rule for making machinima: no cheating. When they shoot \"Red vs. Blue,\" they do not use any special effects that are not organically included in the game; everything you see in an episode of \"Red vs. Blue\" could in theory have taken place during an actual game of Halo, played by a fan in his bedroom. It's a charmingly purist attitude, a sci-fi version of the \"Dogma\" school of indie film, which argues that movies are best when cinematic trickery is kept to a minimum. One evening in New York, I visited with Ethan Vogt as he and his machinima team shot a car-chase scene for a Volvo promo. Vogt and two producers sat at computers, logged into a multiplayer game; each producer controlled a car racing through crowded city streets, while Vogt controlled a free-floating \"camera\" that followed behind, recording the visuals. The vehicles -- an enormous 1972 Chevy Impala and a Volvo V50 -- screamed along at about 60 miles an hour, fishtailing through corners while plowing into mailboxes, lampposts and, occasionally, clots of pedestrians. The lead car burst into flames. \"That's great,\" Vogt said. \"That's great.\" Though it shares with independent filmmaking a do-it-yourself aesthetic, machinima inverts the central tradition of indie film: smallness. With their skimpy budgets, indie directors tend to set movies in kitchens or living rooms -- and focus instead on providing quality acting and scripts. Machinima, in contrast, often has horribly cheesy acting and ham-fisted, purple-prose stories -- but they're set in outer space. Want massive shootouts? Howling mob scenes? Roman gladiatorial armies clashing by night? No problem. It is the rare form of amateur film in which the directors aspire to be not Wes Anderson but George Lucas. Indeed, with video games played on computers, it is now possible to build an entire world from scratch. The core of any video game is its game engine, the software that knows how to render 3-D objects and how to realistically represent the physics of how they move, bounce or collide. But the actual objects inside the game -- the people, the cars, the guns, even the buildings -- can be altered, tweaked or replaced by modifications, or \"mods.\" Mods do not require any deep programming skills; indeed, almost any teenager with a passing acquaintance in graphic-design software can \"re-skin\" a character in a game to make it look like himself, for instance. (Xbox and PlayStation games, in comparison, are much harder to mod, because the consoles are locked boxes, designed to prevent players from tampering with the games.) I was able to see modding in action one night when I visited the ILL Clan, a pioneering machinima group. Their headquarters are the kitchen table in the cramped one-bedroom Brooklyn apartment of Frank Dellario; a lanky, hyperkinetic 42-year-old, he sat on a rickety folding chair, pecking at a keyboard. The table was littered with four computer screens and laptops, the remnants of take-out sushi and a hopelessly tangled morass of computer cords and joysticks; a huge wide-screen TV lurked behind them for viewing their work. On the night I visited, they were using a game engine called Torque to shoot a short heist movie for Audi, in which two thugs beat up a concert violinist and make off with an antique violin in a van. To quickly create a gritty-looking city, Dellario and his colleague -- ILL Clan's co-founder, Matt Dominianni -- hired a local artist to build a generic-looking urban intersection inside the game. To customize it, Dominianni went onto Google, found snapshots of a few seedy stores (an adult bookstore, a tattoo parlor and a furniture outlet) and digitally pasted them onto the front of the buildings. Then they went to a site called Turbo-Squid, a sort of Amazon for virtual in-game items, and for $45 bought a van that could be plunked down inside the game. When I arrived, they were browsing the site and contemplating buying a few women. \"My God, look at this one,\" Dellario marveled, as he clicked open a picture of an eerily realistic 3-D brunette named Masha. \"I'm going to marry this woman. They've finally broken through to total reality.\" Dellario put the van into the correct location in the scene, then logged into the game to figure out the camera angle for this shot. He frowned. It didn't look right. The lighting was all off, with shadows falling in the wrong places. Dominianni figured out the problem: \"The sun is supposed to be at high noon. It's in the wrong place.\" \"Oh, yeah,\" Dellario said. \"Let me move it.\" He pulled up a menu, clicked on the \"sun\" command, and dragged it across the sky. Now they were finally ready to shoot. Dellario realized they needed an extra pair of hands to manipulate one of the thugs. \"Want to act in this scene?\" Dellario asked, and he handed me a joystick. I sat down at one of the computers and took control of \"Thug1,\" a brown-haired man in a golf shirt and brown pants, carrying the stolen violin. Dominianni was playing \"Thug2.\" Our characters were supposed to look around to make sure the coast is clear, then jump in the truck and race off. Dellario gave me my motivation: \"It's like you hear a suspicious noise. You're nervous.\" I used the joystick to practice moving my virtual character, craning its neck -- my neck? -- back and forth. I have played plenty of video games, but this felt awfully odd. Usually when I am inside a game, I'm just worried about staying alive while the bullets whiz past my ears. I've never had to emote. While Dellario and Dominianni fiddled with the camera angle, I grew impatient and wandered around, exploring the virtual set. I peered in a few shop windows -- they were strikingly photorealistic, even up close. Then I walked down an alley and suddenly arrived at the end of the set. It was like a tiny Western town in the desert: once you got beyond the few clustered buildings, there was nothing there -- just a vast, enormous plain, utterly empty and stretching off infinitely into the distance. This spring, electronic arts decided to promote the Sims 2 by hiring Rooster Teeth to create a machinima show using the game. Called \"The Strangerhood,\" it would be freely available online. \"The Strangerhood\" is a parody of reality TV: a group of people wake up one day to discover that they are living in new houses, and they can't remember who they are or how they got there. In the Sims 2, the animated people are impressively Pixar-like and expressive, making \"The Strangerhood\" even more like a mainstream animated show than \"Red vs. Blue\"; you could almost imagine watching it on Saturday morning. The problem is, the Sims 2 has turned out to be incredibly difficult to shoot with. When the Rooster Teeth gang uses Halo for machinima, the characters are mere puppets and can be posed any way the creators want. But in the Sims 2, the little virtual characters have artificial intelligence and free will. When you're playing, you do not control all the action: the fun is in putting your Sims in interesting social situations, then standing back and watching what they'll do. When Rooster Teeth's Matt Hullum builds a virtual set and puts the \"Strangerhood\" characters in place for a shoot, he's never quite sure what will happen. To shoot a scene in which two men wake up in bed together, Hullum had to spend hours playing with the two characters -- who are nominally heterosexual -- forcing them into repeated conversations until they eventually became such good friends they were willing to share a bed. Shooting machinima with Sims is thus maddeningly like using actual, human stars: they're stubborn; they stage hissy fits and stomp off to their trailers. \"We'll do three or four takes of a scene, and one of the Sims will start getting tired and want to go to sleep,\" Hullum said. \"It's just like being on a real set. You're screaming: 'Quick, quick, get the shot! We're losing light!' \" Hullum showed me a typical \"Strangerhood\" scene. He put Nikki, a young ponytailed brunette in a baseball cap, in the kitchen to interact with Wade, a slacker who looked eerily like a digital Owen Wilson. (To give Wade a mellow, San Francisco vibe, Hullum programmed him to move at a pace 50 percent slower than the other characters.) Hullum pointed to Nikki's \"mood\" bar; it was low, which meant she was in a bad mood and wouldn't want to talk. \"When they're bored, you have to lock them in a room alone for a few hours until they start to crave conversation,\" Hullum said. He tried anyway, prodding Wade to approach her and talk about food, one of Nikki's favorite subjects. It worked. The two became engrossed in a conversation, laughing and gesticulating wildly. \"See, this footage would be great if we were shooting a scene where these guys are maybe gossiping,\" Hullum mused, as he zoomed the camera in to frame a close-up on Wade. Then Nikki started to yawn. \"Oh, damn. See -- she's getting bored. Oh, no, she's walking away,\" Hullum said, as the little virtual Nikki wandered out of the room. \"Damn. You see what we have to deal with?\" The audience for \"The Strangerhood\" has not exploded the way \"Red vs. Blue\" did. The project is a gamble: its creators hope it will break out of machinima's geeky subculture and vault into the mainstream. Though in a way, Hullum said, the mainstream isn't always a fun place to be, either. Before he returned to Austin to work on \"Red vs. Blue,\" he spent six miserable years in Hollywood working on second-rate teen movies with big budgets, like \"Scooby-Doo\" and \"The Faculty.\" \"So now to come to this, where we have total creative control of our own stuff, it's amazing,\" Hullum said, as he watched Nikki walk out of the house in search of a more interesting conversation. \"I just pray we can keep this going. Because if we can't, I'm in big trouble.\" Clive Thompson is a contributing writer for the magazine."

                "SYNTHETIC WORLDS The Business and Culture of Online Games. By Edward Castronova. 332 pp. University of Chicago Press. $29. SMARTBOMB The Quest for Art, Entertainment and Big Bucks in the Videogame Revolution. By Heather Chaplin and Aaron Ruby. 287 pp. Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill. $24.95. Here's a theory that may be neither original nor empirically defensible but feels true: The more fun an activity is, the less interesting it is to read about. War producces great journalism; water-skiing does not. Can you guess where video games fall on this spectrum? In the last few years, a great many words have been expended to report on this flourishing cultural phenomenon. Most accounts begin with a hyperactive presentation of statistics, which we will not rehearse here. This is all you need to know (and perhaps already do): Video games have grown into a huge business, outpacing the movie industry and bulldozing childhood as we knew it. We adults are not safe, either. Whether they admit it or not, you probably have friends who can be found awake at 2 a.m. disemboweling orcs, foiling terrorist plots and scooping up fumbles and running them into end zones. It is the opinion of Edward Castronova, author of \"Synthetic Worlds,\" that such electronic experiences are not merely a hedge against boredom but a profound indicator of where the entire world is heading. Online, off-line; reality, fantasy -- these distinctions will cease to matter as more and more of us pass our time in virtual environments. Economies will evolve as we pay real money for virtual goods and vice versa. Conflicts that begin online will spill into the real world and back. Laws will be written to protect our newfound interests. Castronova's vision has elements of both utopia and dystopia. But mostly he is bullish. Life in these alternative zones may eventually become so fulfilling, he contends, \"that a fairly substantial exodus may loom in the distance.\" He means this, really. Like the Irish and Italians who left their native lands in the late 19th century to come to America, gamers could create a genuine human migration, away from the real and into the virtual. What will be real then? The specific object of Castronova's scholarship is Mmorpgs, the inelegant acronym for \"massively multiplayer online role-playing games,\" which can involve hundreds of thousands of players plugging in from all over the world. A disproportionate number of these games revolve around dwarfs, wizards, quests and magic lands, though the content is becoming ever more diverse. These days, there's a Mmorpg out there to suit the interests of just about anybody. One game, The Sims Online, merely simulates suburban life, and it is madly popular. Castronova is an economist who teaches telecommunications at Indiana University, and among academic economists he is a bold contrarian, if only because he dares to take computer games seriously. My oh my does he take them seriously. In dense, lifeless prose, he sledgehammers away at his major themes, constantly pausing to review the material he's just covered and preview what is to come. His sweeping conclusions are intriguing -- get ready for governments sending agents into virtual worlds and waging war with avatars! -- but he's not a vivid enough writer to animate most of his futuristic abstractions. In \"Smartbomb,\" Heather Chaplin and Aaron Ruby try harder to entertain. They've organized their history of video games as a study of ambitious individuals, breaking it down into a series of breezy, magazinelike profiles of uneven quality. A lot of the original reporting seems to take place at gaming conventions, which is not where one imagines the really interesting stuff happens. But the stories are pretty good, even when they don't break new ground. Rereading the legend of Nolan Bushnell and the founding of Atari is like hearing a bar band play a spirited \"Twist and Shout\" -- enjoyable, but no additional points for Degree of Difficulty. In two spots, though, Chaplin and Ruby really score. In their chapter on Mmorpgs, they sensitively profile David Reber, a 30-year-old Californian who spends every free moment chained to his computer, acting out a series of intense fantasy existences that provide him with the companionship and sense of achievement missing in his real life. Just as Castronova would predict, Reber withdraws from the real world as his fantasy life deepens -- he has lapses at work and when Chaplin and Ruby last check in with him, he's moved back in with his mother. The other winning portrait in \"Smartbomb\" is of Will Wright, the creator of SimCity, as well as its offshoot The Sims, and a new simulation called Spore in which players guide a new creature from its biological origin onward. In an industry that mimics Hollywood's craven predilection for cheap, gory theatrics, Wright stands apart as a humble philosopher in love with the potential of games to expand the human experience. Though Chaplin and Ruby don't have much to say themselves about the significance of video games, they wisely hand matters over to Wright, who foresees a future that might just keep us all staying up past 2 a.m. \"I think one thing that's unique about video games is not only that they can respond to you but down the road they'll be able to adapt themselves to you. They'll learn your desires,\" he says. \"It might just be that games become deeply personal artifacts -- more like dreams.\" Video Game Books Hugo Lindgren is the editorial director of New York Magazine."

                "THE great thing about shopping for video games is that the person you're buying the gift for almost certainly knows more about it than you do. If you have gamers in your life, no matter what age, odds are that they already know exactly what they want. You need only shut up and fork over the credit card. You can use this to your advantage. If you are lucky enough that the gamer on your list has said anything recently about a game or game machine that is not Microsoft's new Xbox 360, the smart move is to drop whatever you're doing right now and buy it. That way, you will not be among the hordes this holiday season already wondering if they can afford to miss a car payment, or maybe a mortgage installment, to satisfy their 360-craving gamer. That is because the 360, with its snazzy graphics and slick online interface, has emerged as the It gift of the 2005 holiday season. Theoretically, the 360 is supposed to cost $300 for a basic unit and $400 for the deluxe version. In reality, the console is sold out across the country and is now fetching $1,000 or so on eBay. And that's before you buy any games, which run up to $60 each. So if your favorite gamer is interested in anything else this year, consider yourself fortunate. Thankfully, forgoing the 360 doesn't mean returning to the Stone Age of, say, Pong. There are still excellent games being made for the current generation of home game consoles -- Sony's PlayStation 2, Nintendo's GameCube, and the original Xbox, which each cost less than $200 -- and Sony's $250 PSP headlines the strong current crop of hand-held units. Moreover, if you have a powerful PC, that may still be your most capable game machine. In any case, both Sony and Nintendo have new game consoles on the way next year. And availability of the 360 is sure to improve in early 2006. There is a chance that Microsoft could show up with a \"surprise\" boatload of additional 360's in the next few weeks. (The word from the company is that it is working as hard as it can to get units to retailers.) Unless you're willing to pay the prices on eBay or other auction sites, the best advice to shoppers who absolutely must have a 360 is to get themselves on waiting lists at as many retailers and Web sites as possible. So those folks you saw camped out on sidewalks before the 360 went on sale on Nov. 22 don't look so silly now, right? Waiting in line for a midnight sale at a Wal-Mart in Moline, Ill., Kara Harvell told The Quad-City Times that she wanted to buy the console for her five sons. Deliciously, the newspaper reported that Ms. Harvell, a nursing school student, \"got out of class by telling her professor that her son wasn't feeling well at school.\" Of course, some people don't like waiting in line. In the (very) few days before the machine sold out, scattered reports emerged of shoppers being held up for their 360's as they left stores. Please don't go robbing anyone. But if you've already gone through the effort of finding a 360 at its regular price, it is certainly worth the extra $100 for the higher-end model. The full version comes with a headset (for making free phone calls over the Internet to other Xbox users), a wireless controller (instead of a wired model) and a hard drive, which you need to play games made for the original Xbox. Top-line games are $50 to $60. The unit comes with a free basic membership to Microsoft's online game service, which lets you talk to other online 360 users and compare scores. But if you want to actually play head-to-head live over the Internet, you need to buy the \"gold\" membership, which costs $8 a month or $50 a year. In addition to playing games with eye-popping graphics, the machine plays DVD's and can display photos from your digital camera on your regular or high-definition television. Luckily, the 360 is not the only game system potentially worth buying this holiday season. There are cheaper and more readily available options, too. Besides the Xbox 360, the other major new game machine is Sony's PSP hand-held. The sleek black unit has a clear, colorful screen that is far more vibrant than one would expect from a hand-held device, and that may be why people on buses and trains seem to be using their PSP's to watch movies as much as playing games. Dozens of movies are now being released on the small UMD data discs that slip into the back of the PSP, which inexplicably comes with white headphones reminiscent of those supplied with Apple's iPods. Over all, the games for the PSP have been lackluster so far, but that trend shows signs of changing. Aimed at adults, the new Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories takes advantage of the PSP's built-in wireless capability to allow multiple PSP users to battle one another through the game's streets and alleys, even as the players themselves are on the go. Next year, a new installment of the quirky family-friendly Japanese game Katamari Damacy is expected for the PSP. Even cheaper and smaller than the PSP is Nintendo's DS hand-held, which costs about $130. Nintendo has long been popular with young gamers, but the new Nintendogs pet simulator is finding fans among both children and adult women. The screens on the DS, which stands for dual screen, are not quite as impressive as the PSP's, but are still clear enough for enjoyable gaming. But rather than play on the go, many people still prefer their video games on the television in the den. With all of the hype around the 360 it is easy to overlook that you can now buy the original Xbox or Sony's PlayStation 2 each for around $150. Bundles that include a console and a few games can be found under $300 on the Web. Nintendo's GameCube console now costs only around $100. Of course, the Xbox, GameCube and PS2 certainly don't have the cachet of the new 360. And most serious gamers already have one, two or even all three of the older systems. But if you are looking for a cost-effective way to introduce a young person to gaming, buying any of the older systems is a smart move. In fact, many serious gamers would argue that the games being made now for those mature machines are actually better than those for the 360, which is still so new that developers have not yet figured out how to fully harness its power. The older games just don't look quite as snazzy. But until Sony's PlayStation 3 and Nintendo's Revolution are released next year, the Xbox 360 is clearly the best gaming machine around (unless you want to consider a top-notch gaming PC, which could easily cost more than $2,000). If someone you know wants a 360 and you can't find it at a reasonable price, perhaps fend them off with a PSP or a gift certificate that can be exchanged for some new games for an existing console. Then promise you'll get a 360, PlayStation 3 or Revolution next year. You may forget the promise, but they won't. Is It Live, or Is It A Video Game? THERE are about 20 games available for Microsoft's new Xbox 360. It does not have a single hit title yet, as Halo became for the original Xbox, and the lineup is still missing some genres, like role-playing games. Nonetheless, games out now do a good job of demonstrating how the next generation of consoles deliver visual and social experiences far more sophisticated than those possible on older consoles. The strongest two genres on the 360 are auto racing and first-person shooters. On the racetrack, Project Gotham Racing 3 lets you speed through detailed recreated cities like New York, Las Vegas and London. You can race in online leagues, compete against \"ghosts\" that simulate your friends' best performances or \"tune in\" and watch from the sidelines as some of the best virtual drivers in the world go wheel to wheel. The shooters put a player in the perspective of a person fighting, often with guns. Among the standouts are Perfect Dark Zero, set in the near future, and Call of Duty 2, a gritty re-creation of World War II. The most visually impressive 360 game is Kameo: Elements of Power, an action adventure that looks like child's play, with its evocation of a Pixar animated film, but is challenging at points. About half the games for the 360 mimic real-life sports. NBA 2K6, which at times could pass for a live telecast, is the most impressive of the bunch. Amped 3, a snowboarding simulator, is easy to play and gorgeous to watch. SETH SCHIESEL"

                "Tomorrow the Xbox, the new video-game console from Microsoft, arrives in stores on the heels of a $500 million marketing blitz. But it doesn't seem as if much of that money is going to the thousands of musicians who have provided the company with songs to use in the games that will be played on it. Though a band can typically make $10,000 to $20,000 when a song is included in a video game, Microsoft has been asking musicians to contribute their music to video games for pennies -- and in some cases no money at all, with no upfront fee and no royalties on the back end. Musicians, from small, independent punk bands to major-label artists, have been accepting this deal, hoping for the promotional boost that comes with being heard in a game that is played obsessively by teenagers across the country. Joining a band is not a lucrative career choice for most musicians. Many who are signed to major labels spend their careers in debt to those record companies, trying to earn back advances and expenses. But the increasing use of contemporary songs in movies, video games and advertisements has meant an unexpected windfall for lesser-known and midlevel artists. Microsoft, however, is changing that dynamic. ''I asked if we could get any money, and they just said no,'' said Larry Cooper, who runs Revelation Records, a punk, metal and hardcore label that has several songs on the soundtrack to Amped, a snowboarding game. ''I almost thought that out of principle, if there's no payment, we shouldn't do that kind of stuff. But I didn't want to snip out an opportunity for a band that might want to do that kind of promotion.'' Of the bands Mr. Cooper asked, all but one agreed to provide free music to Microsoft. ''I think they were just looking for cheap music, and that's why they called a lot of small labels,'' Mr. Cooper continued. ''I asked them who else was on the soundtrack and made some suggestions, but they said they wanted to stick with certain labels because they didn't have to pay for licensing.'' Brenner Adams, a product planner on Amped, said that on his game Microsoft was looking not for cheap music but for an opportunity to expose as many small underground bands as possible. Under Microsoft policy the interview with Mr. Adams was conducted with a company publicist on the line, taking notes on the conversation. ''We're not saying, 'Hey, we want to use your music for nothing,' '' Mr. Adams said. ''We said, 'Hey, we really want to promote these artists and promote who they are and what they stand for.' '' Though Microsoft didn't give any money to musicians on such independent labels, it did offer small amounts to bands on major labels. It made a deal with Virgin Records, obtaining songs from acts like the Gorillaz, Iggy Pop, the Chemical Brothers and Timbaland & Magoo by paying ''small fees and publishing,'' said Brad Fox, the director of artist development at Virgin. The amount of course remains a big contrast to the millions of dollars that Microsoft is believed to have paid to use Madonna's ''Ray of Light'' in its 60-second Windows XP advertisement. ''We're looking at this as a marketing exercise,'' Mr. Fox said. ''There's no way I could get 10 to 15 different artists in somebody's house in front of an active consumer audience for 20 hours a week. If I could get 20 percent of those kids to go buy a record, that's great.'' But the Xbox isn't like other systems, nor are these deals like other deals. Many record labels are operating on the faith that Microsoft will make efforts to promote their bands. Mr. Fox said he hoped that the Virgin artists used in the games would be mentioned in Xbox promotional material, game catalogs and game boxes. But a trip to the Xbox Web site showed that the artists on games like Amped were not mentioned on the box or promotional poster shown online, nor were the bands on any game highlighted in any special way on the Web site. Other promotional efforts, however, have been made: there was a link at the site to a radio station playing music from Amped, and at a recent Xbox promotional party in Los Angeles Microsoft gave away a CD with music from Amped. Mr. Adams noted that most of the cash deals were made with better-known bands that don't need the publicity as much. ''So,'' he said, ''why not turn the decision around, bring the smaller guys up and give them the promotion they can't get anywhere else?'' He said that music from some 240 artists was used on Amped, that in the game the names of the record labels are shown on banners and that players had the option of seeing names of the bands, songs and record labels. He added that the company hoped to stage more promotions with the music. But there is no guarantee that gamers will hear much if any of the music of these bands. That is because in a feature unique to the Xbox consumers have the option of wiping out the soundtrack to a game and replacing it with music from their own CD's. Originally music executives were less worried about artists not getting paid than about the potential for Xbox to become a new Napster, since it has a large hard drive and online capabilities. But in a statement prepared for this article Microsoft said that though music could be stored on the hard drive, it could not be copied on ''CD's, MP3's or any other devices.'' Other executives in the music publishing business now worry that video game manufacturers and even advertising agencies will follow Microsoft's lead and tell bands that in exchange for use of their music at no cost, an extra effort will be made to promote the groups in products and commercials. As it is, artists sacrifice a lot of money and time at the altar of promotion, taking on costly and inconvenient tasks gratis, like performing concerts promoted by radio stations. So, some wonder, in a field in which just about anything musicians do can be seen as raising their profiles, where is the line between promotional and paid work? Jeff Koz, the chief executive of SubZero, a company that brokers deals between advertisers and musicians, said, ''We believe that people should be paid for what they do.'' Mr. Koz has worked with Microsoft on music and sound design. He added, however, that there was a give-and-take between payment and promotion, and lesser-known artists were often given somewhat lower fees in exchange for what could be career-enhancing exposure. ''There's value to cross-promotion,'' he said, ''and we're not privy to how those Microsoft deals went down. Some of those bands might see it as a tremendous opportunity.'' No. 1 and Dropping The new Britney Spears album, ''Britney,'' will enter the pop charts next week at No. 1 with 769,000 copies sold, according to Soundscan, a company that tracks retail sales. The number, a significant drop from the first-week sales of her previous album (1.3 million), reflects a teenage pop demand that is slipping but still hanging on tenaciously as Ms. Spears sagely remakes her image so she has one foot in the teenage world and the other in the general pop market (an approach best summed up by her song title ''I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman''). The following week, record executives say, ''Britney'' seems likely to slip to No. 2 when the Garth Brooks album ''Scarecrow'' makes its debut with predicted sales of more than one million copies."

                "LOS ANGELES — Microsoft, seeking to expand offerings on its Xbox 360 console, has reached an agreement with a company headed by Peter Safran, the veteran Hollywood producer and talent manager, to produce original shows for distribution on the system. Through his Safran Co., he represents clients like the actor and producer Sean Combs (\"Monster's Ball\"), the actor and writer Nia Vardalos (\"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\") and the filmmakers Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer (\"Epic Movie\"). Safran founded the company in 2006 after leaving Brillstein-Grey Management. Speaking by telephone last week, Scott Nocas, global marketing manager for programming of the Xbox Live entertainment service, said he expected similar deals to follow. \"We definitely look at this as the first of many,\" said Nocas. In an interview at his office in Los Angeles last week, Safran said his first round of programs would be scripted and would probably run under 10 minutes. He said his initial focus would be on genres like comedy and horror that appeal to the Xbox 360 audience, which is heavily concentrated from the ages of 14 to 34, and tends to be more male than female. The first shows are expected to be available to viewers by autumn in the Northern Hemisphere. \"The Xbox is unique; it operates at a level outside of what we generally consider Web entertainment,\" Safran said, referring to the system's tight demographic base, which is defined by the appeal of signature games like the Halo series. The new shows will be available exclusively via the Xbox 360 for a time, then may appear elsewhere, Safran said."

                "Looking for an advantage in the next round of the video-console wars, Microsoft has made the first move. Three and a half years after it entered the console market with the Xbox, Microsoft yesterday unveiled its successor, the Xbox 360, a creamy white console that is to go on sale in North America, Europe and Japan by the holiday season. Though noticeably smaller than its squat black predecessor, the console houses three 3.2-gigahertz I.B.M. microprocessors that could qualify it as the most powerful home computer on the market. Indeed, unlike the original Xbox, the new console can act as a home entertainment hub, streaming pictures, music and video from digital cameras, portable music players and computers that run Microsoft Windows XP. Most evidently different, Xbox 360, which Microsoft introduced last night in a 30-minute presentation on MTV, is designed to display games in wide-screen, high-definition format as well as in standard definition. Microsoft's move, after years of secrecy, rumors and fragmentary disclosures, comes as its competitors -- Sony, the undisputed industry leader, and Nintendo, a close third worldwide -- are also preparing presentations of their coming consoles for the Electronic Entertainment Expo, a major industry trade show, in Los Angeles next week. Representatives of those companies said their game systems, Sony's PlayStation 3 and Nintendo's, which is code-named Revolution, are set for release next year. For the game industry, with $10 billion a year in sales in the United States alone, the consoles' arrivals will not only give rise to new demand for game hardware but will set off a new wave of game development and purchases. As the consoles put new emphasis on high-definition video, they may stimulate TV sales as well. One analyst, describing the anticipation surrounding the announcements, said it was as if Detroit released a new line of automobiles only once every four or five years. \"The business is getting bigger, the stakes are getting higher, and there is such a big leap in technology, potentially making the games ever more realistic and involving,\" said Anita Frazier, entertainment industry analyst for NPD Funworld. Microsoft did not disclose the pricing of its new console. Since their introductions, the current Xbox and Sony's PlayStation 2 have dropped in price from $300 to $150 in the United States; Nintendo's GameCube, originally $200, is now $100. When Xbox arrived in 2001, it was heralded as the most powerful of the consoles and had innovations including a built-in hard drive and an Ethernet port for online play. The machine's biggest hits have been the Halo games, published by Microsoft itself; Halo 2, released last fall, has sold 6.3 million copies. Xbox has also developed a following among game developers, who have been drawn to its power. Still, even with 20 million consoles sold, Xbox has been far outdistanced by Sony's PlayStation 2, with sales of 80 million and 70 percent of the world market. While Halo 2's success put Microsoft's games unit in the black for one quarter last year, the Xbox effort has yet to provide sustained profitability. \"Xbox 1 was very much ready, fire, aim,\" said J Allard, corporate vice president at Microsoft and a leading architect of the Xbox effort. \"We had 19 months and a day between the day we approved the project to the day we were on store shelves.\" For the new Xbox project, Mr. Allard said his team had twice that time and aimed at conceiving a \"magical product\" that was so well integrated it would seem the creation of a single mind. In sheer computing power, the new Xbox is capable of a trillion calculations per second, many orders of magnitude above the original Xbox. (The current box depends mainly on a 733-megahertz processor.) The heat generated by all that power will be drawn off by a water-based cooling system, something usually seen only in high-end PC's. It will also include a redesigned wireless game controller. A Web camera, code-named Cyclops, and a TV-like remote control will be optional. Peter Moore, a Microsoft corporate vice president for worldwide sales and marketing, said Xbox 360 would be especially suited for wide-screen high-definition television and Digital Dolby 5.1 multichannel sound, a requirement for all Xbox 360 games. He added that the new console would also be more seamlessly integrated with Xbox Live, the service that connects games and gamers over high-speed Internet connections for multiplayer action. Xbox Live, which has 1.4 million subscribers, will include a new tier that waives the $6 monthly fee. A demonstration of the console's power delivered stunningly realistic scenes that were indistinguishable at some points from live-action video. \"We have to continue to feed that core audience,\" Robert J. Bach, senior vice president and chief Xbox officer at Microsoft, said of the most ardent gamers. \"But part of the challenge of this next generation is how do we cultivate a broader mass audience.\" Part of that strategy, he said, includes designing Xbox 360 to perform a range of nongaming functions suited to the living room, like streaming digital music and pictures, or videoconferencing. In addition to playing DVD's, as the current Xbox does, it can rip songs from CD's onto a 20-gigabyte hard drive -- a hard drive that can be removed, upgraded and interchanged with other 360 consoles. Judging by dozens of Web sites dedicated to interest in next-generation consoles, expectations are soaring that Xbox 360's competitors will also provide vastly improved graphics, sound and game playing. For example, it is widely believed that Sony's PlayStation 3, which will use a new cell processor technology, will be the most powerful. Molly Smith, a Sony spokeswoman, would not discuss hardware specifics of the PlayStation 3. But she did say that it would be able to deliver \"a quantum leap\" in gaming and electronic entertainment. Nintendo, struggling to shed an image that its technologies mostly appeal to children, is preparing to deliver a game console that is radically different from the cute and cuddly GameCube. Perrin Kaplan, Nintendo's vice president for corporate affairs, said GameCube's successor would be \"very, very sleek.\" She described it as horizontal and no taller than a stack of three DVD cases. Unlike GameCube, the new system will play DVD's, Ms. Kaplin said, and will feature a wireless controller. It will play GameCube games as well as a new class of high-definition games, with new emphasis on online play. Microsoft would not say whether games for the current Xbox would play on Xbox 360. Some industry analysts and game developers said it was likely that games for all three consoles would increase to $60 or $65; the typical price for premium titles on the current machines is $50. \"Over all, the introduction of the next-generation systems will have a very positive impact on the video game industry,\" said Will Kassoy, vice president for global brand management at Activision, a game publisher. \"They will expand the user base and grow software sales.\" Historically, he said, each new cycle of consoles has ushered in a 30 percent rise in the number of players. \"We believe this next generation will see similar growth,\" Mr. Kassoy said. Activision is scheduled to have four games for Xbox 360 at the start, including some of the company's best-selling series -- Tony Hawk, Call to Duty and Quake. Simon Jeffery, president of Sega, said his company would have two titles for Xbox 360 for the holiday season -- Condemned: Criminal Origins and Full Auto -- emphasizing that they will take advantage of the new console's increased power. \"Every successive jump in technology affords new elements of games,\" he said. \"We now will have processing power to do things we haven't been able to do before.\""

                "Sending voice and Webcam picture messages to fellow Xbox 360 players over Microsoft’s Xbox Live service is a cinch, but tapping out old-fashioned text messages using the 360’s onscreen keyboard isn’t much fun. A new $30 miniature keyboard called the Chatpad speeds up text entry to let you best even the fastest BlackBerry touch-typists.  The Chatpad, to go on sale Sept. 6, attaches to the underside of the 360’s controller without interfering with the controller’s comfortable feel in the hands. A backlight makes typing during late-night Gears of War campaigns easier on the eyes, and a dedicated Messenger button activates the 360’s instant messaging program so you can taunt your enemies without breaking from the action. Unfortunately you can’t use the keyboard to type a letter and jump to the corresponding spot in long lists of Xbox Live movie downloads or songs stored on an iPod connected to the 360. Instead, you need to hold down the scroll button. Albert Penello, director for global marketing for Xbox, said the company was looking into a way to add this feature. "

                "FORGET horsepower, forget miles per gallon: the key metric for judging the Nissan Urge, a design study to be introduced today at the North American International Automobile Show in Detroit, is polygons per second, an index of performance for video games. Five hundred million polygons a second is the rating for the Microsoft Xbox 360 video game system tucked away in the car's trunk. It pumps out images fast enough to generate dizzyingly sharp scenes of city streets and speeding cars on a display that folds down from above the windshield. The Urge's key trick is that when parked, its steering wheel and pedals can be used to control the Xbox. The game's soundtrack of roaring engines and screeching tires play through the car's speakers to accompany the action on the screen. Many cars have had video game displays installed in their dashboards. The Urge is the first car to be turned into a game controller -- the tail is now wagging the dog. The Urge, created at Nissan Design America in the La Jolla section of San Diego, is another of the auto industry's seemingly endless quests for \"echo boomer\" customers, a coterie that for carmakers gleams over the horizon the way the mythical city of Eldorado did for the conquistadors. In part, the Urge is a response to an online survey, said John Cupit, a design manager for Nissan. Mr. Cupit interpreted the survey results in the bare, exposed look of the Urge, an articulation of the car's parts aimed, he said, at giving the feel of a motorcycle. The fenders and structure, mostly aluminum, stand out as separate parts. The engine -- a piece of the car so unimportant in this case that Nissan did not even provide the usual specifications of horsepower and torque -- is visible beneath a transparent hood. Nissan calls the look \"minimalism to the maximum.\" The bottoms of the doors are cut away, revealing a surrounding frame of aluminum rendered in \"acid yellow,\" which Anka Mazzei, the color designer, said she chose to express intensity and speed. The front end of the Urge is similar to the GT-R Proto, a concept that Nissan unveiled at the Tokyo auto show last fall. But one should not take the exterior of the Urge too literally. Its weirdness signals that it is unlikely to become a production vehicle. What counts is the concept. Urge is an implicit response to cultural change: young buyers have proved more fascinated by the innovations of their new cellphones, hand-held devices and video games than by the automotive advances that captivated their parents. The showcase game for the Xbox 360 is a special edition of Project Gotham Racing, one of the hit titles for the original Xbox as well. Mr. Cupit said that he and his colleagues at the La Jolla studio spend a lot of time playing on a huge plasma screen. The project was a joint effort with Microsoft, so the Xbox 360 beneath the boattail- shape trunk, one of a half-million consoles shipped since the game system went on sale Nov. 22, is different from the others: no one stood in line to buy it. Video gaming is not the only technology incorporated into the Urge. In addition to the Xbox 360, there is an iPod docking station and a cellphone that doubles as a \"smart key\" to start the engine. In at least one respect, the Urge might be the perfect car: it burns no gasoline while parked for game playing; it generates no emissions; it lines up in no traffic jams. It can virtually roll through the streets of Las Vegas or spin around the Nürburgring. Its version of Gotham Racing can even run uptown on the parts of Broadway that are one-way heading downtown, a special thrill for Manhattan drivers. With a wireless connection, in theory, two Urges could be parked side-by-side for competition like the old racing games at the arcade in Atlantic City. Thanks to the Internet, the same thing could be done even if the Urges were half a world apart. The game encourages stylish driving. Good driving through the curves earns the driver style points, called Kudos, that can be redeemed for a better vehicle. According to the Microsoft programmers, power sliding, pulling off a 360-degree spin, getting air time, drafting and getting up on two wheels \"will earn gamers Kudos points for their style and skill.\" Too bad the real automotive world doesn't work this way. Each car in the game is made up of 80,000 polygons and takes eight days of programming by its creators, who are holed up in the London studio of Bizarre Creations. Real-world details include gauges that move and realistic bug-smash streaks on the windshield. Oddly, the Urge itself is not among the cars you can drive on the screen. That will probably be remedied soon. Project Gotham players and programmers regularly produce new cars that can be downloaded. The Urge's notion of car-as-video game is not unprecedented. A similar concept, the Scion Speedster -- a red Scion xA show car built by 5 Axis Productions in Huntington Beach, Calif. -- was displayed at the Specialty Equipment Market Association trade show in Las Vegas last fall. The Speedster also has an open panel in the doors -- and two Xboxes running the Forza racing game onboard. The two cars simply evolved at the same time, Mr. Cupit said. He prefers his version of the idea. \"We tried to take seriously designing the door glass to protect the occupants from wind and rain, and also vehicle ingress-egress,\" he said. \"Our door moves up and down to ease entry into the car, for example.\" \"We often visit tuner and customizing shows to see what young people are thinking about,\" Mr. Cupit said. \"The Urge helps reinvent the sports car for the next generation of young people.\" Observing young people at auto shows, it is impossible not to note that they pay more attention to how their cars look and sound than how fast they go. The investment tends to go into electronics and colorful bolt-on parts, rather than into making the engine run faster and more furious. Maybe more automakers should put Xboxes in their cars. General Motors and Ford might stir up interest by tucking Xbox 360's into all their trunks."

                "REDMOND, Wash. — Microsoft is betting it has a new way to win the wallets of consumers. The company on Tuesday introduced the new version of its Xbox video game console. The Xbox has been one of Microsoft’s few undeniable consumer hits of the last decade, a product that was not just a credible entry into the games business but also a sign of the innovation possible at a company that is rarely seen as an inventive thinker. “I think of Xbox as the accidental success out of Microsoft,” said James McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester Research, who added that the connection Microsoft has formed with the players of its current Xbox is “much deeper than any relationship Microsoft has ever achieved before.”  The new console, the Xbox One, will enter a market very different from the one its predecessor, the Xbox 360, entered nearly eight years ago, when there was no iPad, smartphones had keyboards and mobile gaming devices were primitive at best.  Today, video games can be played almost anywhere, on any device, with the biggest possible audience of online friends and without the aid of a costly gaming console. The last year or two has been bumpy for Microsoft’s consumer efforts. The Windows 8 operating system software and the Surface tablet-computing devices got a tepid reception from the public when they went on sale last fall.  The company’s mobile phone efforts have been largely ignored. And even Bing, Microsoft’s Internet search engine, has failed to close a wide gap with Google, the market leader.  Microsoft, though, could see better results with the Xbox. With it, it hopes it can reassert the living room as the place where people can still get the best gaming experience, complete with eye-popping graphics and innovative methods for controlling games. It is also a place where Microsoft’s technology can be at the center of a home entertainment system and the funnel through which people gain access to online video. Microsoft has sold more than 76 million of the device’s current incarnation, the Xbox 360 worldwide, compared with almost 100 million Wii consoles from Nintendo and more than 70 million PlayStation 3s from Sony.  The company also controls what may be the most valuable asset in console gaming, Xbox Live, a subscription-based online service with 48 million members who use it to play games against one another and watch movies.  “You can do a lot of things on the phone and a lot of things on tablets,” said John Taylor, an analyst at Arcadia Investment. But, he said, “you can’t do the same kinds of things on those devices” that you can on a television screen. Microsoft plans to develop its own original, live-action television series, which will be accessible through the Xbox. The series will be made in partnership with the director Steven Spielberg and will be based on the popular Halo video game franchise.  The company is also working with the National Football League to develop an app for Xbox that lets players interact with their fantasy football teams while watching a live game. In an interview, Don A. Mattrick, the president of Microsoft’s interactive entertainment business, said that he recognized the growing appeal of mobile devices for gaming and that Microsoft would aggressively tie smartphones and tablets into the experience of using its console. He became most animated when talking about the possibilities of the new Xbox for providers of video programming. “We’re going to the take the form from a one-way experience pushed through a straw to where you can communicate back and make it interactive,” Mr. Mattrick said.  Even if it is a wild success, the new Xbox is likely to have a bigger impact on consumer perception than it will on Microsoft’s overall sales. The Xbox remains a small slice of the company’s business, which is still dominated by sales of Windows, Office and other software. The company’s games division represented only 4 percent of its operating profit. At an event in a carnival tent on its corporate campus, Microsoft did not say how much the new system would cost or how publishing partners would charge for games, which typically start at around $60 for high-end game consoles.  A major feature of the new Xbox, which is expected to hit store shelves in time for the holiday season, will be a new generation of Kinect, the camera-based motion-control sensor introduced several years ago as an Xbox 360 accessory. The new Kinect will come with every Xbox One. Traditional retail sales of games have come under pressure in recent years as mobile devices like the iPhone and iPad have invaded their turf with free and low-cost games. While many gamers dismiss those offerings as inferior to console games, the games have nevertheless tapped into a huge audience of players who may never have played on an Xbox or Sony’s PlayStation. The games business could use a jolt. Total United States retail sales of game hardware and software fell 25 percent to $495.2 million in April from $657.5 million a year earlier, according to estimates by NPD Group, a research firm. That figure does not include the sale of downloadable content over the Internet. Alex St. John, an entrepreneur who worked on Microsoft’s pre-Xbox game efforts, says he is pessimistic about prospects for gaming consoles. “They’re coming out with the latest and greatest stone tool,” Mr. St. John said. “The new console that trumps the old console is called the Apple iPad. This generation of kids loves mobile games.”"

                "Three months after surprising the video game industry with strong sales of its first console, the Microsoft Corporation will dispatch its chairman, Bill Gates, to Tokyo this week to introduce its assault on an inhospitable Japanese market. Not since the industry's early days, when Atari competed for space in video arcades, has a major American game company tried to dethrone Japanese hardware makers on their own turf. When it begins selling its Xbox game system in Japan on Friday, Microsoft will try to use the star power of Mr. Gates and a lineup of specialized games to battle the leaders, Sony and Nintendo. Many industry insiders predict that the Xbox, which has sold more than 1.5 million units in North America since November, will face tough going in Japan, where American software companies have found tremendous difficulties merely putting their games onto store shelves. ''You are talking about a closed market and going up against two very strong, very entrenched competitors,'' said Heath A. Terry, a game software analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston. ''For Microsoft to expect significant success early on in that market is unrealistic.'' The Xbox has other strikes against it for Japanese consumers, who buy about a third of the world's game products. Analysts worry that the console is too big for the living room in a country where smaller gadgets rule. And at about $260, the Xbox costs $40 more than Sony's PlayStation2 and $75 more than Nintendo's GameCube. Yet analysts and software makers acknowledge that Microsoft, the world's No. 1 software company, managed the North American rollout of the Xbox better than they had expected. They also noted that it has deep pockets and has shown unflagging persistence in entering other businesses. The company has already made one significant adjustment specifically for Japan: after criticism from early testers, it built smaller game controllers, with buttons closer together, to better fit the hands of the average Japanese player. Peter Moore, president and chief operating officer for Sega of America, the American division of the Japanese games publisher, said Microsoft's early success in North America gave the company a fighting chance in Japan and Europe, where the Xbox goes on sale on March 14. ''It's eerily reminiscent of the power of the launch of the PlayStation,'' he said, referring to Sony's first console. ''The way a powerful global company can attack an industry, get under its skin and change an industry.'' Hirohisa Ohura, who runs Microsoft's Xbox division in Japan, said the North American introduction had proved that the company could compete in the video game business. While calling Japan ''the most challenging market'' for the Xbox, he said Microsoft would keep chipping away at its competitors for the loyalty of Japanese game players. ''U.S. companies coming into Japan as a game vendor tended to fail and walk away real quick,'' Mr. Ohura said. ''We're not willing to give up at any point. Once we're in this business, we're in here to win.'' In its quest for the buzz that makes or breaks video games, Microsoft set up hundreds of Xbox kiosks in Tokyo and Osaka earlier this month. And for the introduction on Friday, Mr. Gates himself will stump for the Xbox at an event similar to his appearance last November at the opening of the Toys ''R'' Us store in Times Square. Microsoft began taking advance orders on Feb. 2 for consoles, including 50,000 special edition systems with a translucent case and a silver-plated key chain engraved with the autograph of Mr. Gates -- an accessory that has been mocked on online message boards and game publications. Sony, the consumer electronics giant, has an enormous head start on Microsoft. By Dec. 31, Sony said, it had shipped 25 million of its next-generation consoles, the PlayStation2, including 10 million to North America and 8 million to Japan. ''The burden isn't on our company to compete with them; the burden is significantly on Microsoft to compete with us,'' said Molly Smith, a spokeswoman for Sony Computer Entertainment America, the company's American division. The list of best-selling software is dominated by titles that run on the PlayStation2. Yet while they have capitalized on Sony's success in North America, large American game publishers have found the Japanese market difficult to penetrate and have been forced to cooperate with Japanese publishers to develop games specifically for Japan and have games sold there. Electronic Arts is the No. 1 publisher of PlayStation2 titles in North America, but only No. 7 in Japan. ''The secret in Japan is getting product that's culturally appealing to Japanese consumers,'' said Stan McKee, chief financial officer of Electronic Arts. Microsoft has forged partnerships of its own with more than 90 Japanese publishers, but still faces an uphill battle. Because of Sony's lead, analysts said, Microsoft will consider its introduction a success if it wins close to 20 percent of the Japanese market."

                "Reaching out to millions of aspiring game developers around the world, Microsoft plans today to announce a contest that will award $10,000 and the opportunity to entice millions of eyeballs to the next great digital diversion for the company’s Xbox 360. In addition to the game console’s snazzy graphics, the Xbox Live online service has been the most important component of the Xbox 360’s success since its debut in 2005. And perhaps the most popular aspect of Xbox Live has been the service’s arcade component, which allows users to download and play smaller, relatively simpler games like Uno and Geometry Wars that usually cost less than $10. (By contrast, top-end games can sell in stores for around $60.) The popularity of Xbox Live Arcade has in turn attracted the attention of game developers looking to create the next Tetris or Minesweeper. Late last year, Microsoft introduced a suite of software tools for making so-called casual games called XNA.  And so at a game makers’ convention in San Francisco, Microsoft plans to announce a contest akin to the television show “Project Greenlight” that will award a cash prize and a potential slot on Xbox Live Arcade to the best new game created with XNA tools. The company intends to announce the winner of the contest, called “Dream-Build-Play,” in August.  “This competition highlights the power of XNA and the popularity of the Xbox Live Arcade service with its millions of users,” Aaron Greenberg, Microsoft’s group product manager for the Xbox 360 and Xbox Live, said in a telephone interview.  To help increase the popularity of casual games, Microsoft will also announce the introduction of a new 512-megabyte portable storage device for the Xbox 360. The previous portable storage unit contained only 64 megabytes of data, and so Xbox Live Arcade games had been limited to an official size of 50 megabytes. With the new unit, Microsoft will also raise the official size limit on Xbox Live Arcade games to 150 megabytes, allowing enhanced graphics, sound and artificial intelligence. SETH SCHIESEL"

                "Raising the ante in the video game wars, Microsoft is bringing out a new version of the Xbox 360 game machine that has a bigger hard drive, better high-definition video support and a stylish black finish, not an insignificant feature in a world where looking cool ranks high. The idea is to appeal to an elite class of hardcore game players who would like a little more of everything.   “Today’s games-and-entertainment enthusiast has an insatiable appetite for digital high-definition content,” said Peter Moore, corporate vice president for Microsoft’s interactive entertainment business, in Redmond, Wash.   The Xbox 360 Elite, which is to be announced today and will be in stores in late April, will have a list price of $479, or $80 more than the Xbox 360 Pro and $180 more than the basic Xbox 360. The new model has a 120-gigabyte hard drive, in contrast to the standard model’s 20-gigabyte drive. It also has a high-definition multimedia interface port and cable and a wireless controller and headset. Current Xbox 360 owners can buy the new 120-gigabyte hard drive as a separate accessory for $179.  Microsoft is clearly hoping to fill what it sees as a hole at the top end of the market. The Nintendo Wii has been outselling the PlayStation 3 from Sony and the Xbox 360 in recent months, but that system is largely positioned as a family-friendly game machine that can be purchased for $50 less than the lowest-priced Xbox. The Sony system is priced higher than both the Nintendo and the Microsoft systems, with the cheapest model priced at $499.  Both Microsoft and Sony have positioned their consoles as entertainment hubs, not just for playing sophisticated video games but also for listening to music and viewing downloaded movies and television shows.   John Rodman, group product manager for the Xbox platform and Xbox Live, pointed to a recent Microsoft survey that revealed that nearly 40 percent of the time that Xbox 360 users spent with their consoles was for activities other than gaming.   Yet when it comes to gaming, Xbox 360 users are serious, Mr. Rodman says. Six out of 10 Xbox 360 users use Xbox Live, Microsoft’s online gaming service.   “We don’t feel like the Wii customer and the Xbox customer are the same thing,” he said. “We think that as soon as the Wii customer turns 14 they want something else.”  James L. McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester Research, said that Microsoft hoped to encourage customers to spend more money downloading movies and games, which require considerable hard-drive space. "

                "LOS ANGELES  Reaching out beyond hardcore video game players to everyday consumers, Microsoft outlined an entertainment strategy on Monday for making the company’s Xbox 360 game console a gateway for movies, television and social networking. In a media presentation on the eve of E3, the video game industry’s biggest North American convention, Microsoft announced new relationships with the social networking giants Facebook and Twitter as well as Sky, the big British satellite television provider that is a unit of the News Corporation.  Microsoft announced that Facebook users would be able to access their profiles and share photos on their television through the Xbox Live network and that Twitter devotees would also be able to post and read messages through the service.  More far-reaching was Microsoft’s new deal with Sky, under which Xbox Live users in Britain will be able to watch live television, including professional soccer, over an Internet version of the Sky service. Not every channel available over satellite will be available over Xbox Live, but the offering will include dozens of stations, Microsoft executives said. Users will be able to watch television in a virtual party room with their friends, discussing the program as they are watching, they said.  Microsoft has long sought a bigger role in home television, going so far in years past as to try to build its own set-top box business. Partnering with Sky represents a back door into the television market. The company has also recognized how Nintendo has expanded the traditional audience for video games with its innovative motion-sensitive controller for the Wii. Microsoft provided the first public demonstration of its futuristic Project Natal, which it hopes will usher in an age of completely controller-free gaming.  Using a sophisticated camera, infrared sensors and voice recognition software, Natal allows users to control a game or other programs, like a virtual painting studio, merely by waving their arms, speaking to the system and moving around. Microsoft did not say when the technology would become available. Microsoft also demonstrated some of its coming big games, including Forza Motorsport 3, the suspense-thriller Alan Wake and a new version of its biggest hit, Halo. Hideo Kojima, the developer behind the Metal Gear series, said that the next major installment in that franchise would be available for Xbox 360, a coup for Microsoft because previous Metal Gear games had been exclusive to Sony game machines."

                " NEW YORK — Buyers of the Xbox 360, Microsoft's second-generation video game console, will expect to play big, expensive marquee games like \"Call of Duty 2\" from Activision and \"Madden NFL 06\" by Electronic Arts. But Microsoft is also banking on them to play small arcade-style video games, purchased and downloaded from the Internet. Unlike its competitors, the Sony PlayStation 2 and Nintendo GameCube, the new Xbox, which goes on sale on Nov. 22, can play games on two separate tracks. One is the familiar terrain of big-budget, deeply immersive games that feel more like interactive movies than games. The other is a return to the video game's arcade roots. But the arcade games are not simple, said Greg Canessa, group manager of Xbox Live Arcade, part of the Xbox division.\"Arcade games are really miniature Xbox 360 games,\" he said. The price is somewhat miniaturized as well. To develop the arcade games cost $100,000 to $200,000, compared with $15 million to $20 million for the larger games. The arcade games will be sold only online, downloadable through the Xbox's broadband-only Internet connection. Microsoft has not officially announced prices for the games, but it is widely expected that they will cost $5 to $10. By contrast, new Xbox games sold at retailers like Best Buy are likely to cost $60, or about $10 more than previous Xbox games, according to some game publishers. The new machines, slimmer and more powerful than the original Xbox released in 2001, will cost $300 for a basic model and $400 for a model with a 20-gigabyte hard drive. They will also be able to play DVDs, CDs and standard music files, including MP3 and Windows Media Audio files, as well as display digital snapshots on a TV screen. Those functions and the arcade-type gaming feature are central to Microsoft's strategy to reach a broader family market, beyond the young male players who have been the Xbox's primary audience.To do that, Peter Moore, vice president for marketing at Xbox International, said Microsoft would eliminate the need for credit cards in making online purchases of games, accessories and upgrades. Instead of credit cards, the Xbox Live online service will accept Microsoft value cards that can be bought in various denominations online or at retail and convenience stores, Moore said. The value cards would function, in effect, like tokens in an arcade. \"We have to get credit cards out of the way,\" he said. \"We've got to broaden this to younger demographics.\" Another big selling point for the 360 is its enhanced Internet connectivity through the Xbox Live service.Microsoft will give Xbox 360 owners a free subscription to Xbox Live Silver, which gives players access to the online system's features, including the ability to buy and download games. A Gold membership, at $50 a year, permits users to play games with others over the Internet. Canessa, the group manager of Xbox Live Arcade, said that each arcade game could play at 1080i high definition and that most could take advantage of the 360's ability to communicate with other players over a broadband Internet connection. \"We will have from 12 to 15 games by launch,\" Canessa said. At least 75 percent, he added, will be capable of being played live online by more than one player.Each Xbox 360, he said, will include a free copy of the full version of \"Hexic HD,\" an arcade-style puzzle game developed by Alexey Pajitnov, the creator of \"Tetris.\" \"We created a whole market, a whole new world, for downloadable games,\" Canessa said. While online arcade games have proved popular on personal computers, Canessa said he believed that the 360's embrace of arcade games would further invigorate independent game design. \"The indie game developers is one of the opportunities I'm most excited about,\" he said. \"You have small, independent, three guys in a garage making games, totally innovating. It's the Sundance Film Festival, if you will, of games.\" "

                " SEATTLE — In a bid to make its games unit profitable by 2007, Microsoft is planning to start selling a more expensive version of its Xbox game console this autumn. The premium Xbox 360 console will sell for $399.99 in the United States, nearly three times the price of the current Xbox, according to an announcement made by Microsoft on Wednesday. The premium console will sell for399.99, or $490.67, in Continental Europe, while its scaled-back version, called \"Xbox 360 Core System,\" will sell for $299.99 in the United States and299.99 in Europe. Microsoft is counting on the new releases of its console to make its video game unit profitable by 2007, according to Robert Bach, senior vice president for Microsoft's home and entertainment division. The game unit of Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, has lost $2.8 billion in the last three years, while Sony's rival console, the PlayStation, is profitable. Bach predicted that the Xbox 360 would outsell Sony's PlayStation 3, which is scheduled for release next year, even though the PlayStation 2 has outsold the Xbox by nearly 4 to 1. Various Xbox accessories, like a 20-gigabyte detachable hard drive and a wireless controller that will be delivered with the premium version of the console, will also be available for purchase as an add-on for the less expensive \"core\" console. Microsoft is also planning to sell other Xbox accessories, like a wireless controller and TV remote, a headset for the Xbox Live online service and an Ethernet cable for high-speed Internet connections. The company said that it remained on target to ship the new Xbox to stores in North America, Europe and Japan in time for the upcoming holiday season, ahead of Sony's PlayStation 3, which is slated to replace the PlayStation 2 in the spring. Bach noted that both new versions of the Xbox would support high-definition visuals and play music and movies. These features were not part of the original Xbox release, which cost $299 four years ago but now sells for $150. Matt Rosoff, an analyst at the independent research firm Directions on Microsoft, said he doubted that enthusiasts would balk at the price increase for the new releases.\"Hard-core gamers will be on board,\" Rosoff said. \"I think the sticker shock might be in the larger audience Microsoft is trying to reach,\" like casual game players and neophytes, he added. Microsoft sells its current Xbox console at a loss because its primary goal was to break into the lucrative game market. It makes money selling games, but does not expect its home and entertainment division to post profits regularly until 2007. \"They need to not lose a lot of money on the console this time,\" said Ben Bajarin, an analyst at Creative Strategies in Campbell, California. \"They'd like to get closer to a small margin of profit on the console.\" The core console will not be able to play games designed for the original Xbox unless a consumer spends $99.99 to add a hard drive. Microsoft has asked developers working on future games to make them in such a way that they could be played on both the fully loaded and basic versions of the console. Pricing for the new Xbox in Japan, where Microsoft sells just a few hundred consoles a week, will not be announced until the Tokyo Game Show in September, Bach said. "

                " SAN JOSE, California — The tit-for- tat battle for customers between Sony and Microsoft continued Thursday as the Japanese electronics group announced plans to introduce an online gaming service when its PlayStation 3 video game console is released in the fall. The news of the service, which lets users buy games and communicate and compete with other players via the Web, comes days after Tokyo-based Sony said that it would delay the release of its next-generation PlayStationconsole until November, putting it a year behind Microsoft's popular Xbox 360. The much-awaited start had originally been scheduled for the spring and the news, on March 15, prompted Microsoft to announce this week that it was more than doubling shipments of the Xbox 360. Phil Harrison, president of worldwide studios for Sony Computer Entertainment, said that the basic level of Sony's online service, known internally as PlayStation Network Platform, would be free, and would allow users to play against each other online, e-mail and chat with friends. Additional game services and premium content will be made available to users who pay a subscription fee, Harrison said. Sony, one of the world's leading technology manufacturers and entertainment companies, is hoping to retain its dominance over the roughly $30 billion global video game market with the PS3. Microsoft introduced the Xbox 360 game console in November. The company's Xbox Live subscription service, which offers game downloads and online play, has been a hit on the new machine and Sony had been widely expected to offer a similar service. Built in collaboration with Sony Online Entertainment, which already offers PC game downloads and a marketplace for trading virtual assets, the service was inspired by businesses like the online auction site eBay and the online retailer Amazon.com, where communities of users contribute ratings and recommendations. It also steals a page from social networking sites like Myspace.com, which has attracted millions of users. \"We have to fall into step with consumer expectations,\" said Harrison, who said the social aspects of the network promise to get people more involved in gaming. With broadband adoption on the rise and television viewership dropping, advertisers are exploring the possibility of buying ad space in games much like they now do on the Web. \"This can provide a tremendous revenue stream for our industry,\" Harrison said. Video game makers, which have seen sales fall as gamers wait and save for new consoles, have been under pressure to find new ways to offset rising game development costs. Microsoft said Tuesday that Xbox Live had logged more than 10 million downloads.More than 85 percent of Xbox 360 consoles that are connected to the Internet have downloaded games, trailers and videos from the subscription service, Microsoft said. Downloads appeal to many game makers, because they can cut costs by selling direct to consumers. Online distribution also gives them a way to head off piracy and used game sales by providing a way to check that the player of a game is also its owner. Anita Frazier, an analyst with NPD Group, a market research company, said most publishers were \"treading lightly\" into direct online sales of games because they do not want to alienate retailers, but added that such services would likely open the market for more games.$@ "

                "Executives at Microsoft are fond of saying that its subscription gaming service, Xbox Live, should be thought of as a cable channel. They want Xbox to be seen not merely as a gaming machine for teenagers, but as a media portal for parents and grandparents, too. The company is even producing shows for users: it is in the middle of the second season of “1 vs. 100,” an interactive version of a game show that was on NBC. The content ambitions do not end there. Microsoft has held in-depth talks with the Walt Disney Company about a programming deal with ESPN, according to people close to the talks, who requested anonymity because the talks were intended to be private. For a per-subscriber fee, ESPN could provide live streams of sporting events, similar to the ones available through ESPN 360, a service that is available from some high-speed Internet providers. Microsoft could also create some interactive games in association with ESPN, the people said. One of the people said the deal was not imminent. The companies declined to comment. Already, video game consoles are putting a new emphasis on the video, rather than the game.  The roughly 20 million monthly members of Xbox Live can surf Facebook, browse an online mall of movies and TV episodes and, if they pay, watch Netflix.  “It’s 20 million connected living rooms,” said Marc Whitten, the general manager of Xbox Live. Similarly, users of the Sony PlayStation can tune into BBC shows and see Weather Channel updates, as well as stream Netflix. Last week, Netflix extended its streaming service to the Nintendo Wii.  Among the many companies that want to transport the on-demand qualities of the Internet into the living room  the over-the-top model, in industry parlance  the console makers have a significant head start. Nearly 60 percent of American homes now have at least one console, according to the consulting firm Deloitte, up from 44 percent three years ago. “For both of the big guys, it’s about extending the value of the hardware platform,” said Mike McGuire, a vice president for the research firm Gartner, referring to Microsoft and Sony. “The devices are hooked to TVs and have broadband connections, and there are more and more opportunities to license movies and TV shows and deliver them in over-the-top models.” Microsoft said this month that it had sold 39 million Xbox 360 consoles around the world. About half sign into Xbox Live each month. At that size, “it starts to feel like a cable network,” said Mark Kroese, who oversees Xbox advertising sales for Microsoft. The company does not specify how many members pay for access to premium services like Netflix; basic functions of Xbox Live are free. The company says it regularly counts more than a million concurrent users  and topped out at 2.2 million at one point during Christmas week last month. That compares favorably to some of the top channels on cable, like TBS and the Cartoon Network, which reach about one million viewers at any given time, according to the Nielsen Company.  The comparisons are crude at best because many of Xbox Live’s users are playing games rather than watching video. No third-party measurement exists, because ratings companies like Nielsen do not yet track the service fully. But there is no doubt that consoles are expanding their domain, something that is evident in Mr. Whitten’s vision of the service: “The entertainment you want, the people you care about, wherever you are.” The addition of Netflix in late 2008 was an important step into the entertainment arena for Xbox, and perhaps a precursor to Microsoft’s current talks with Hollywood producers. Without releasing specific numbers, Mr. Whitten said the streaming movies and TV service were “very, very popular,” including in his own household. Mr. Whitten said Microsoft wanted to be a bigger player in television and film viewing. He declined to comment on the conversations with Disney but said more than once that “there’s going to be a ton of experimentation around business models and rights.” “Our goal is, really, how can we get as much content there as possible,” he said. Disney is not alone in showing an interest in the console market. Many companies sell TV episodes and film rentals through Microsoft’s online store, and Web video ventures are clamoring to have a place on the service. Console makers have a long way to go to be considered replacements for cable subscriptions, but, at the very least, they could put a dent in the time spent viewing traditional TV. The interactive game show “1 vs. 100” drew well over 100,000 concurrent users at times during its first season last year, according to Microsoft’s internal data. During the second season, which began in November, two-hour TV-style trivia competitions are scheduled on Tuesday and Friday nights. A voice-over announcer, shown onscreen as an avatar, provides live color commentary. Like the defunct NBC show, the game has a contestant, “The One,” and a “Mob” of 100 other players. Members of the audience can watch passively or play along, improving their odds of being picked to play for prizes. Unlike on the live-action TV show, every player on Xbox is represented by a cartoonish avatar. Dave McCarthy, a general manager at Microsoft Game Studios, said the scheduled TV-style shows provided a guarantee that “you’re a part of something bigger.” Beyond the game show realm, Microsoft also exclusively shows “The Guild,” a sitcom that it bills as “Seinfeld” meets video game culture. It stars its creator, the actress Felicia Day, and is sponsored by Sprint. For advertisers like Sprint, online communities like Xbox Live are another arena to pursue consumers. Within “1 vs. 100” there are 15- and 30-second commercial breaks like on TV. Those spots account for about 15 percent of the service’s advertising revenue; most of the rest comes from ads on Xbox Live navigation pages, like display ads on Web sites.  In November, Nielsen started to track “1 vs. 100” play and ad views. The pilot program “is the tip of the iceberg,” said Gerardo Guzman, a director for Nielsen Games; eventually, he hopes to generate TV-style ratings. Mr. Kroese said Xbox advertisers were “very interested in being able to compare the media buy on Xbox to other media buys they do.” Microsoft says nearly half of Xbox Live members use its entertainment content; the rest mostly play multiplayer games. But it expects that more of its users will try the entertainment side and the line between them will blur further. “I don’t think there’s a real difference between a game and ‘Lost.’ Or a game and ‘American Idol.’ They’re all ways we spend our leisure time,” Mr. Whitten said.  Over time, he predicted, “these narrow swim lanes  games, music, movies, etc.  will dissolve.”"

                "WASHINGTON — In late January, as China locked down some provinces to contain the spread of the coronavirus, average internet speeds in the country slowed as people who were stuck inside went online more and clogged the networks. In Hubei Province, the epicenter of infections, mobile broadband speeds fell by more than half. In mid-February, when the virus hit Italy, Germany and Spain, internet speeds in those countries also began to deteriorate. And last week, as a wave of stay-at-home orders rolled out across the United States, the average time it took to download videos, emails and documents increased as broadband speeds declined 4.9 percent from the previous week, according to Ookla, a broadband speed testing service. Median download speeds dropped 38 percent in San Jose, Calif., and 24 percent in New York, according to Broadband Now, a consumer broadband research site. Quarantines around the world have made people more reliant on the internet to communicate, work, learn and stay entertained. But as the use of YouTube, Netflix, Zoom videoconferencing, Facebook calls and videogaming has surged to new highs, the stress on internet infrastructure is starting to show in Europe and the United States — and the traffic is probably far from its peak. “This is totally unprecedented,” said Thierry Breton, a European Union commissioner who oversees digital policy and was a chief executive of France Télécom. “We have to be proactive.” To head off problems, European regulators like Mr. Breton have pushed streaming companies such as Netflix and YouTube to reduce the size of their video files so they don’t take up as much bandwidth. In the United States, regulators have given wireless carriers access to more spectrum to bolster the capacity of their networks. Some tech companies have responded to the call to ease internet traffic. YouTube, which is owned by Google, said this week that it would reduce the quality of its videos from high to standard definition across the globe. Disney delayed the start of its Disney Plus streaming service in France by two weeks, and Microsoft’s Xbox asked gaming companies to introduce online updates and new releases only at certain times to prevent network congestion. “We really don’t know how long we’re going to be in this mode for,” Dave Temkin, Netflix’s vice president of network and systems infrastructure, said in a webinar on Wednesday on how the coronavirus could affect internet infrastructure. Internet service providers like Comcast, Vodafone, Verizon and Telefónica have been building out their networks for years to account for increasing demand. But company officials said they had never seen such a steep, sudden surge. Growth that the industry had expected to take a year is happening over days, said Enrique Blanco, the chief technology officer at Telefónica, a Spanish telecommunications company. “In just two days we grew all the traffic we had planned for 2020,” Mr. Blanco said. On Monday, traffic on AT&T’s networks was up 27 percent compared to the same day last month, and last week Verizon experienced a 22 percent increase in traffic on its wireless and fiber broadband service. Wi-Fi calls doubled from their normal volume, the carriers said. In Europe, internet traffic into homes over fixed lines was up more than 30 percent, according to Telefónica. Activities like online gaming and video conferencing have more than doubled, while messages over WhatsApp have more than quadrupled. So much traffic and stress on internet networks has slowed the speed of downloading web pages and apps, according to Ookla. “Congestion is higher,” said Adriane Blum, an Ookla spokeswoman. “We’re all at home, and the activities we’re doing in this unprecedented time are not low-bandwidth usage, which means a lot of activity on a network.” Cisco said demand for its WebEx teleconference service had tracked the spread of the coronavirus. Demand first surged in Asia, then in Europe, and last week it soared 240 percent in the United States. The demand has pushed up failure rates delivering video conferencing, said Sri Srinivasan, a Cisco senior vice president in charge of WebEx. “I don’t know if we’ll soon see a peak, not for weeks to come,” he said. “The reason I say that is because we aren’t seeing traffic in Asia slow down even now.” Internet service providers said they could handle the deluge of traffic but were adding capacity. Verizon, Cox and AT&T said they were building more cell sites to strengthen mobile networks, increasing the number of fiber connections on their network backbones, and upgrading the routing and switching technology that lets devices talk to one another and share an internet connection. Orange, formerly France Télécom, has doubled its capacity inside undersea internet cables. In Italy, where home internet use is up 90 percent, Telecom Italia said its technicians continued to make repairs and add capacity. Vodafone, one of Europe’s largest networks operators, said it had increased its capacity 50 percent in recent weeks through a mix of software and the addition of more equipment in the field. “We’re seeing some signs of stress,” AT&T’s chief executive, Randall Stephenson, said in an interview on CNN on Sunday. “We’re having to go out and do some augmentation of networks, and so we’re sending our employees out there to get that done, but right now the network is performing quite well.” To prevent clogged networks, Europe has taken the most aggressive steps. Last week, Mr. Breton, the European Union commissioner, discussed reducing the bitstreams of videos with Reed Hastings, the chief executive of Netflix; Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Google; and Susan Wojcicki, the head of YouTube. The companies agreed, as did Amazon for its Prime Video streaming service and Twitch, its online gaming platform. Many of the companies then went further. On Tuesday, Netflix decided to switch its high-definition video streams in India, Australia and Latin America to slightly lower quality to reduce the traffic they create there by 25 percent, and YouTube said it would make all global streams standard definition. “We continue to work closely with governments and network operators around the globe to do our part to minimize stress on the system during this unprecedented situation,” YouTube said in a statement. Microsoft’s Xbox gaming business recently asked large gaming companies to release online updates of their games during off-peak hours while it helped focus on the critical internet needs of people involved in the coronavirus crisis, according to an Xbox email reviewed by The New York Times. Video game updates can require great amounts of bandwidth to download. Xbox asked the companies to release updates in a four-hour overnight window in North America, and only from Monday through Thursday. “Microsoft is actively monitoring performance and usage trends to ensure we’re optimizing service for our customers worldwide, and accommodating new growth and demand,” the company said. “At the same time, these are unprecedented times, and we’re also taking proactive steps to plan for these high-usage periods.” While U.S. regulators said they did not plan to follow Europe in asking for streaming and social media companies to degrade their services, they are taking other steps. Last week, the Federal Communications Commission granted Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile temporary access to more airwaves. “The F.C.C. has been coordinating closely with network operators to ensure those networks remain up and running,” Ajit Pai, the agency’s chairman, said in a statement. Telefónica’s Mr. Blanco, who has been living under a lockdown in Spain, said he expected the record traffic to last for some time. It may even become the new normal, he said. In Spain, internet use drops only at 8 p.m., when people across the country go to their windows to cheer health workers and others who are helping to manage the crisis. “Suddenly at 8 p.m. it goes down, then it goes back up,” Mr. Blanco said. “It’s a beautiful thing.” Cecilia Kang reported from Washington, Davey Alba from New York and Adam Satariano from London.

                "The last time I was unemployed was in the depths of the Great Recession. I had recently moved in with my girlfriend, who suddenly found herself with an out-of-work partner who rarely left the house. But she gave me some surprising advice: Play video games. I would have a lot of time on my hands, she said, and while I could and should certainly do other things — housework, exercise, searching for a job — I would mostly be stuck at home with limited resources. Without something to occupy my mind, I’d go crazy. She was right. Playing video games helped ease my mind, elevate my mood and possibly saved our relationship. This year we’ll celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary. So now I’m going to give the same advice to anyone who is now out of work, or otherwise kept at home: Play video games. And don’t feel bad about it. If you’re not a gamer, you might think of video games as simple time-wasters. But for those stuck mostly inside without work, killing time is a real problem. And in the world of big-budget console games, 10 to 15 hours is a fairly short experience. Some can take hundreds of hours to complete. There are online games designed to be played and replayed for thousands of hours. But games are more than just empty time-wasters. In periods of pain, boredom or personal emptiness, video games can serve as palliative care for both the body and the mind. Think of gaming as a personal stimulus plan for a nation of unexpected shut-ins: It’s not a long-term solution, it won’t work for everyone, and it won’t solve the underlying problems — but it can provide limited, temporary relief for some. Video games take many forms, but they are all essentially simulations. And when the real world is temporarily unavailable, a simulated version might be what we need. Among other things, video games simulate work: Even the simplest games give players tasks, objectives, lists of things they have to do, problems to solve and a sense of accomplishment upon completion. And the biggest modern games offer seemingly endless lists of quests and objectives, tasks and subtasks, systems to learn and skills to be mastered. A game like the online shooter Destiny 2 offers hundreds, if not thousands, of hours of play, exploration and study. Set in an intricately designed sci-fi world, it tasks players with taking out wave after wave of alien enemies. It also rewards them for understanding a complex character progression system that involves completing ever-more-difficult goals and objectives, sometimes multiple times, in exchange for rarer and more powerful weapons and armor. You might not actually accomplish anything after a day spent checking off quests and gathering virtual materials, but you’ll feel like you did. Game critics have noted the worklike nature of many modern games for years, not always favorably. But in a world of stay-at-home mass unemployment, even the illusion of accomplishment is probably better than none at all. Indeed, the particular shut-in nature of our current crisis makes video games unusually relevant in a different way: What video games do better than any other medium is simulate places. Open-world games like Skyrim, Red Dead Redemption II or The Witcher 3 are built around giant, explorable spaces, sometimes the virtual equivalent of hundreds of square miles, with elaborate geography and shifting weather. They can take days or weeks to fully explore and at their best can be unexpectedly beautiful, offering the opportunity to encounter animated versions of sun-dappled vistas or foggy mountain peaks, to wander through crowded city streets or stroll past others on well-trod footpaths. Games can give us someplace else to go. That makes games useful in another way. Some of us are shut in alone. But especially in cities, many are now effectively trapped inside modest apartments with family or roommates, and little private space. Games offer a form of personal escape, a way to simulate being elsewhere from the confines of your couch. And for those who are alone, games can also serve as social spaces, virtual fields of play for cooperative adventures or competitive contests. Many of today’s most popular games are online experiences that allow players to engage with friends as well as strangers, to forge digital versions of the same sort of bonds with teammates that can develop in the real world. If you’re new at this, the cost of entry is fairly low: There are thousands of high-quality games available for phones, and many more available to download directly to your computer. Even better, many big-budget games are free if you have a computer or game console on which to play them. Late last year, Destiny 2, released in 2017 as a full-priced game, reinvented itself as a free-to-play experience, with the base game available at no cost (players can pay for expansions). Several of the “battle royale” games that have defined the new wave of first-person shooters are also free: A relatively well-reviewed recent entry, Call of Duty: Warzone, offers several clever twists on the popular last-player-standing formula. Not everyone wants to play online shooters, but for those willing to spend a little there are now subscription services that offer access to a large library of games for an annual or monthly fee. For little more than the price of a standard Netflix plan, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate offers access to dozens of games, from moody, philosophical puzzle games like The Talos Principle to richly animated platformers like Ori and the Will of the Wisps. There are sports games, strategy games, role-playing games and simple twitchy diversions that recall the arcade games I pumped quarters into as a kid. And for those who not satisfied with our current quasi-apocalypse, there even games about viral outbreaks and attacks, from the strategic epidemic simulator Plague Inc., to the deftly scripted post-pandemic action game The Last of Us, to The Division 2, a military thriller set in emptied-out recreations of downtown Washington and New York after a viral bioweapon wipes out most of the population. Maybe that one hits a little too close to home. Yes, games are frivolous. Yes, they are escapist. But the longer the coronavirus keeps social life and culture in isolation, the more we’ll need frivolity and escapism. There’s a limit, of course, to what video games can do: They can’t serve as long-term substitutes for real places, real work or real human interaction. But they can give us a simulacrum of all those things at a time when the real ones are in short supply, and tide us over until the world we actually need returns.

                "Like many young hipsters in Austin, Tex., Michael Burns wanted to make it big in some creative field -- perhaps writing comedy scripts in Hollywood. Instead, he wound up in a dead-end job, managing a call center. To kill time, he made friends with a group of equally clever and bored young men at the company where he worked, and they'd sit around talking about their shared passion: video games. Their favorite title was Halo, a best-selling Xbox game in which players control armor-clad soldiers as they wander through gorgeous coastal forests and grim military bunkers and fight an army of lizardlike aliens. Burns and his gang especially loved the \"team versus team\" mode, which is like a digital version of paint ball: instead of fighting aliens, players hook their Xboxes to the Internet, then log on together in a single game, at which point they assemble into two teams -- red-armored soldiers versus blue-armored ones. Instead of shooting aliens, they try to slaughter one another, using grenades, machine guns and death rays. On evenings and weekends, Burns and his friends would cluster around their TV's until the wee hours of the morning, gleefully blowing one another to pieces. \"Halo is like crack,\" Burns recalls thinking. \"I could play it until I die.\" Whenever a friend discovered a particularly cool stunt inside Halo -- for example, obliterating an enemy with a new type of grenade toss -- Burns would record a video of the stunt for posterity. (His friend would perform the move after Burns had run a video cord from his TV to his computer, so he could save it onto his hard drive.) Then he'd post the video on a Web site to show other gamers how the trick was done. To make the videos funnier, sometimes Burns would pull out a microphone and record a comedic voice-over, using video-editing software to make it appear as if the helmeted soldier himself were doing the talking. Then one day he realized that the videos he was making were essentially computer-animated movies, almost like miniature emulations of \"Finding Nemo\" or \"The Incredibles.\" He was using the game to function like a personal Pixar studio. He wondered: Could he use it to create an actual movie or TV series? Burns's group decided to give it a shot. They gathered around the Xbox at Burns's apartment, manipulating their soldiers like tiny virtual actors, bobbing their heads to look as if they were deep in conversation. Burns wrote sharp, sardonic scripts for them to perform. He created a comedy series called \"Red vs. Blue,\" a sort of sci-fi version of \"M*A*S*H.\" In \"Red vs. Blue,\" the soldiers rarely do any fighting; they just stand around insulting one another and musing over the absurdities of war, sounding less like patriotic warriors than like bored, clever video-store clerks. The first 10-minute episode opened with a scene set in Halo's bleakest desert canyon. Two red soldiers stood on their base, peering at two blue soldiers far off in the distance, and traded quips that sounded almost like a slacker disquisition on Iraq: Red Soldier: \"Why are we out here? Far as I can tell, it's just a box canyon in the middle of nowhere, with no way in or out. And the only reason we set up a red base here is because they have a blue base there. And the only reason they have a blue base over there is because we have a red base here.\" When they were done, they posted the episode on their Web site (surreptitiously hosted on computers at work). They figured maybe a few hundred people would see it and get a chuckle or two. Instead, \"Red vs. Blue\" became an instant runaway hit on geek blogs, and within a single day, 20,000 people stampeded to the Web site to download the file. The avalanche of traffic crashed the company server. \"My boss came into the office and was like, 'What the hell is going on?' \" Burns recalls. \"I looked over at the server, and it was going blink, blink, blink.\" Thrilled, Burns and his crew quickly cranked out another video, then another. They kept up a weekly production schedule, and after a few months, \"Red vs. Blue\" had, like some dystopian version of \"Friends,\" become a piece of appointment viewing. Nearly a million people were downloading each episode every Friday, writing mash notes to the creators and asking if they could buy a DVD of the collected episodes. Mainstream media picked up on the phenomenon. The Village Voice described it as \" 'Clerks' meets 'Star Wars,' \" and the BBC called it \"riotously funny\" and said it was \"reminiscent of the anarchic energy of 'South Park.' \" Burns realized something strange was going on. He and his crew had created a hit comedy show -- entirely inside a video game. Video games have not enjoyed good publicity lately. Hillary Clinton has been denouncing the violence in titles like Grand Theft Auto, which was yanked out of many stores last month amid news that players had unlocked sex scenes hidden inside. Yet when they're not bemoaning the virtual bloodshed, cultural pundits grudgingly admit that today's games have become impressively cinematic. It's not merely that the graphics are so good: the camera angles inside the games borrow literally from the visual language of film. When you're playing Halo and look up at the sun, you'll see a little \"lens flare,\" as if you were viewing the whole experience through the eyepiece of a 16-millimeter Arriflex. By using the game to actually make cinema, Burns and his crew flipped a switch that neatly closed a self-referential media loop: movies begat games that begat movies. And Burns and his crew aren't alone. Video-game aficionados have been creating \"machinima\" -- an ungainly term mixing \"machine\" and \"cinema\" and pronounced ma-SHEEN-i-ma -- since the late 90's. \"Red vs. Blue\" is the first to break out of the underground, and now corporations like Volvo are hiring machinima artists to make short promotional films, while MTV, Spike TV and the Independent Film Channel are running comedy shorts and music videos produced inside games. By last spring, Burns and his friends were making so much money from \"Red vs. Blue\" that they left their jobs and founded Rooster Teeth Productions. Now they produce machinima full time. It may be the most unlikely form of indie filmmaking yet -- and one of the most weirdly democratic. \"It's like 'The Blair Witch Project' all over again, except you don't even need a camera,\" says Julie Kanarowski, a product manager with Electronic Arts, the nation's largest video-game publisher. \"You don't even need actors.\" Back in college, Burns and another Rooster Teeth founder, Matt Hullum, wrote and produced a traditional live-action indie movie. It cost $9,000, required a full year to make and was seen by virtually no one. By contrast, the four Xboxes needed to make \"Red vs. Blue\" cost a mere $600. Each 10-minute episode requires a single day to perform and edit and is viewed by hordes of feverish video-game fans the planet over. More than just a cheap way to make an animated movie, machinima allows game players to comment directly on the pop culture they so devotedly consume. Much like \"fan fiction\" (homespun tales featuring popular TV characters) or \"mash-ups\" (music fans blending two songs to create a new hybrid), machinima is a fan-created art form. It's what you get when gamers stop blasting aliens for a second and start messing with the narrative. And God knows, there's plenty to mess with. These days, the worlds inside games are so huge and open-ended that gamers can roam anywhere they wish. Indeed, players often abandon the official goal of the game -- save the princess; vanquish the eldritch forces of evil -- in favor of merely using the virtual environment as a gigantic jungle gym. In one popular piece of Halo machinima, \"Warthog Jump,\" a player cunningly used the game to conduct a series of dazzling physics experiments. He placed grenades in precise locations beneath jeeps and troops, such that when the targets blew sky-high, they pinwheeled through the air in precise formations, like synchronized divers. Another gamer recorded a machinima movie that poked subversive fun at Grand Theft Auto. Instead of playing as a dangerous, cop-killing gangster, the player pretended he was a naïve Canadian tourist -- putting down his gun, dressing in tacky clothes and simply wandering around the game's downtown environment for hours, admiring the scenery. So what's it like to actually shoot a movie inside a game? In June, I visited the Rooster Teeth offices in Buda, Tex., a tiny Austin suburb, to observe Burns and his group as they produced a scene of \"Red vs. Blue.\" Burns, a tall, burly 32-year-old, sat in front of two huge flat-panel screens, preparing the editing software. Nearby were the two Rooster Teeth producers who would be acting on-screen: Geoff Ramsey, a scraggly-bearded 30-year-old whose arms are completely covered in tattoos of fish and skulls, and Gustavo Sorola, a gangly 27-year-old who sprawled in a beanbag chair and peered through his thick architect glasses at the day's e-mail. They were fan letters, Sorola told me, that pour in from teenagers who are as enthusiastic as they are incoherent. \"The way kids write these days,\" he said with a grimace. \"It's like someone threw up on the keyboard.\" In the script they were acting out that day, a pair of \"Red vs. Blue\" soldiers engaged in one of their typically pointless existential arguments, bickering over whether it's possible to kill someone with a toy replica of a real weapon. The Rooster Teeth crew recorded the voice-overs earlier in the day; now they were going to create the animation for the scene. Burns picked up a controller and booted up Halo on an Xbox. He would act as the camera: whatever his character saw would be recorded, from his point of view. Then Sorola and Ramsey logged into the game, teleporting in as an orange-suited and a red-suited soldier. Burns posed them near a massive concrete bunker and frowned as he scrutinized the view on the computer screen. \"Hmmmm,\" he muttered. \"We need something to frame you guys -- some sort of prop.\" He ran his character over to a nearby alien hovercraft, jumped in and parked it next to the actors. \"Sweet!\" he said. \"I like it!\" In a \"Red vs. Blue\" shoot, the actors all must follow one important rule: Be careful not to accidentally kill another actor. \"Sometimes you'll drop your controller and it unintentionally launches a grenade. It takes, like, 20 minutes for the blood splatters to dry up,\" Ramsey said. \"Totally ruins the scene.\" Finally, Burns was ready to go. He shouted, \"Action!\" and the voice-overs began playing over loudspeakers. Sorola and Ramsey acted in time with the dialogue. Acting, in this context, was weirdly minimalist. They mashed the controller joysticks with their thumbs, bobbing the soldiers' heads back and forth roughly in time with important words in each line. \"It's puppetry, basically,\" Ramsey said, as he jiggled his controller. Of all the \"Red vs. Blue\" crew members, Ramsey is renowned for his dexterity with an Xbox. When a scene calls for more than five actors onstage, he'll put another controller on the ground and manipulate it with his right foot, allowing him to perform as two characters simultaneously. As I watched, I was reminded of what initially cracked me up so much about \"Red vs. Blue\": the idea that faceless, anonymous soldiers in a video game have interior lives. It's a \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern\" conceit; \"Red vs. Blue\" is what the game characters talk about when we're not around to play with them. As it turns out, they're a bunch of neurotics straight out of \"Seinfeld.\" One recruit reveals that he chain-smokes inside his airtight armor; a sergeant tells a soldier his battle instructions are to \"scream like a woman.\" And, in a sardonic gloss on the game's endless carnage, none of the soldiers have the vaguest clue why they're fighting. Yet as I discovered, real-life soldiers are among the most ardent fans of \"Red vs. Blue.\" When I walked around the Rooster Teeth office, I found it was festooned with letters, plaques and an enormous American flag, gifts from grateful American troops, many of whom are currently stationed in Iraq. Isn't it a little astonishing, I asked Burns when the crew went out in the baking Texas sun for a break, that actual soldiers are so enamored of a show that portrays troops as inept cowards, leaders as cynical sociopaths and war itself as a supremely meaningless endeavor? Burns laughed, but said the appeal was nothing sinister. \" 'Red vs. Blue' is about downtime,\" he said. \"There's very little action, which is precisely the way things are in real life.\" \"He's right,\" Ramsey added. He himself spent five years in the army after high school. \"We'd just sit around digging ditches and threatening to kill each other all day long,\" he said. \"We were bored out of our minds.\" Perhaps the most unusual thing about machinima is that none of its creators are in jail. After all, they're gleefully plundering intellectual property at a time when the copyright wars have become particularly vicious. Yet video-game companies have been upbeat -- even exuberant -- about the legions of teenagers and artists pillaging their games. This is particularly bewildering in the case of \"Red vs. Blue,\" because Halo is made by Bungie, a subsidiary of Microsoft, a company no stranger to using a courtroom to defend its goods. What the heck is going on? As it turns out, people at Bungie love \"Red vs. Blue.\" \"We thought it was kind of brilliant,\" says Brian Jarrard, the Bungie staff member who manages interactions with fans. \"There are people out there who would never have heard about Halo without 'Red vs. Blue.' It's getting an audience outside the hardcore gaming crowd.\" Sure, Rooster Teeth ripped off Microsoft's intellectual property. But Microsoft got something in return: \"Red vs. Blue\" gave the game a whiff of countercultural coolness, the sort of grass-roots street cred that major corporations desperately crave but can never manufacture. After talking with Rooster Teeth, Microsoft agreed, remarkably, to let them use the game without paying any licensing fees at all. In fact, the company later hired Rooster Teeth to produce \"Red vs. Blue\" videos to play as advertisements in game stores. Microsoft has been so strangely solicitous that when it was developing the sequel to Halo last year, the designers actually inserted a special command -- a joystick button that makes a soldier lower his weapon -- designed solely to make it easier for Rooster Teeth to do dialogue. \"If you're playing the game, there's no reason to lower your weapon at all,\" Burns explained. \"They put that in literally just so we can shoot machinima.\" Other game companies have gone even further. Many now include editing software with their games, specifically to encourage fans to shoot movies. When Valve software released its hit game Half-Life 2 last year, it included \"Faceposer\" software so that machinima creators could tweak the facial expressions of characters. When the Sims 2 -- a sequel to the top-selling game of all time -- came out last year, its publisher, Electronic Arts, set up a Web site so that fans could upload their Sims 2 movies to show to the world. (About 8,000 people so far have done so.) Still, it's one thing for gamers to produce a jokey comedy or a music video. Can machinima actually produce a work of art -- something with serious emotional depth? A few people have tried. In China, a visual artist named Feng Mengbo used the first-person-shooter game Quake III to produce Q4U, in which the screen is filled with multiple versions of himself, killing one another. Players' relationships with constant, blood-splattering violence is a common subject in game art. Last year, the 31-year-old artist Brody Condon produced an unsettling film that consisted of nothing but shots of himself committing suicide inside 50 different video games. \"I try to come to terms with what taking your life means in these games,\" Condon says. \"I'm trying to understand, spiritually, your relationship with an avatar on the screen.\" But even machinima's biggest fans admit that the vast majority of machinima is pretty amateurish. \"It's like if some friends of mine all broke into a movie set, and we all got to use all the cameras and special-effects equipment,\" says Carl Goodman, director of digital media at the American Museum of the Moving Image, which began to hold an annual machinima festival two years ago. \"We wouldn't quite know how to use it, but we'd make some pretty interesting stuff.\" Yet as Goodman points out, there's a competing proposition. Machinima does not always strive to emulate \"realistic,\" artistic movies. On the contrary, it is often explicitly devoted to celebrating the aesthetics of games -- the animations and in-jokes, the precise physics. Most machinima is probably meaningless to people who don't play games, much as ESPN is opaque to anyone who doesn't watch sports. But for those who do play Halo, it was genuinely thrilling to see something like \"Warthog Jump,\" with its meticulously synchronized explosions. The Rooster Teeth crew has its own hilariously stringent rule for making machinima: no cheating. When they shoot \"Red vs. Blue,\" they do not use any special effects that are not organically included in the game; everything you see in an episode of \"Red vs. Blue\" could in theory have taken place during an actual game of Halo, played by a fan in his bedroom. It's a charmingly purist attitude, a sci-fi version of the \"Dogma\" school of indie film, which argues that movies are best when cinematic trickery is kept to a minimum. One evening in New York, I visited with Ethan Vogt as he and his machinima team shot a car-chase scene for a Volvo promo. Vogt and two producers sat at computers, logged into a multiplayer game; each producer controlled a car racing through crowded city streets, while Vogt controlled a free-floating \"camera\" that followed behind, recording the visuals. The vehicles -- an enormous 1972 Chevy Impala and a Volvo V50 -- screamed along at about 60 miles an hour, fishtailing through corners while plowing into mailboxes, lampposts and, occasionally, clots of pedestrians. The lead car burst into flames. \"That's great,\" Vogt said. \"That's great.\" Though it shares with independent filmmaking a do-it-yourself aesthetic, machinima inverts the central tradition of indie film: smallness. With their skimpy budgets, indie directors tend to set movies in kitchens or living rooms -- and focus instead on providing quality acting and scripts. Machinima, in contrast, often has horribly cheesy acting and ham-fisted, purple-prose stories -- but they're set in outer space. Want massive shootouts? Howling mob scenes? Roman gladiatorial armies clashing by night? No problem. It is the rare form of amateur film in which the directors aspire to be not Wes Anderson but George Lucas. Indeed, with video games played on computers, it is now possible to build an entire world from scratch. The core of any video game is its game engine, the software that knows how to render 3-D objects and how to realistically represent the physics of how they move, bounce or collide. But the actual objects inside the game -- the people, the cars, the guns, even the buildings -- can be altered, tweaked or replaced by modifications, or \"mods.\" Mods do not require any deep programming skills; indeed, almost any teenager with a passing acquaintance in graphic-design software can \"re-skin\" a character in a game to make it look like himself, for instance. (Xbox and PlayStation games, in comparison, are much harder to mod, because the consoles are locked boxes, designed to prevent players from tampering with the games.) I was able to see modding in action one night when I visited the ILL Clan, a pioneering machinima group. Their headquarters are the kitchen table in the cramped one-bedroom Brooklyn apartment of Frank Dellario; a lanky, hyperkinetic 42-year-old, he sat on a rickety folding chair, pecking at a keyboard. The table was littered with four computer screens and laptops, the remnants of take-out sushi and a hopelessly tangled morass of computer cords and joysticks; a huge wide-screen TV lurked behind them for viewing their work. On the night I visited, they were using a game engine called Torque to shoot a short heist movie for Audi, in which two thugs beat up a concert violinist and make off with an antique violin in a van. To quickly create a gritty-looking city, Dellario and his colleague -- ILL Clan's co-founder, Matt Dominianni -- hired a local artist to build a generic-looking urban intersection inside the game. To customize it, Dominianni went onto Google, found snapshots of a few seedy stores (an adult bookstore, a tattoo parlor and a furniture outlet) and digitally pasted them onto the front of the buildings. Then they went to a site called Turbo-Squid, a sort of Amazon for virtual in-game items, and for $45 bought a van that could be plunked down inside the game. When I arrived, they were browsing the site and contemplating buying a few women. \"My God, look at this one,\" Dellario marveled, as he clicked open a picture of an eerily realistic 3-D brunette named Masha. \"I'm going to marry this woman. They've finally broken through to total reality.\" Dellario put the van into the correct location in the scene, then logged into the game to figure out the camera angle for this shot. He frowned. It didn't look right. The lighting was all off, with shadows falling in the wrong places. Dominianni figured out the problem: \"The sun is supposed to be at high noon. It's in the wrong place.\" \"Oh, yeah,\" Dellario said. \"Let me move it.\" He pulled up a menu, clicked on the \"sun\" command, and dragged it across the sky. Now they were finally ready to shoot. Dellario realized they needed an extra pair of hands to manipulate one of the thugs. \"Want to act in this scene?\" Dellario asked, and he handed me a joystick. I sat down at one of the computers and took control of \"Thug1,\" a brown-haired man in a golf shirt and brown pants, carrying the stolen violin. Dominianni was playing \"Thug2.\" Our characters were supposed to look around to make sure the coast is clear, then jump in the truck and race off. Dellario gave me my motivation: \"It's like you hear a suspicious noise. You're nervous.\" I used the joystick to practice moving my virtual character, craning its neck -- my neck? -- back and forth. I have played plenty of video games, but this felt awfully odd. Usually when I am inside a game, I'm just worried about staying alive while the bullets whiz past my ears. I've never had to emote. While Dellario and Dominianni fiddled with the camera angle, I grew impatient and wandered around, exploring the virtual set. I peered in a few shop windows -- they were strikingly photorealistic, even up close. Then I walked down an alley and suddenly arrived at the end of the set. It was like a tiny Western town in the desert: once you got beyond the few clustered buildings, there was nothing there -- just a vast, enormous plain, utterly empty and stretching off infinitely into the distance. This spring, electronic arts decided to promote the Sims 2 by hiring Rooster Teeth to create a machinima show using the game. Called \"The Strangerhood,\" it would be freely available online. \"The Strangerhood\" is a parody of reality TV: a group of people wake up one day to discover that they are living in new houses, and they can't remember who they are or how they got there. In the Sims 2, the animated people are impressively Pixar-like and expressive, making \"The Strangerhood\" even more like a mainstream animated show than \"Red vs. Blue\"; you could almost imagine watching it on Saturday morning. The problem is, the Sims 2 has turned out to be incredibly difficult to shoot with. When the Rooster Teeth gang uses Halo for machinima, the characters are mere puppets and can be posed any way the creators want. But in the Sims 2, the little virtual characters have artificial intelligence and free will. When you're playing, you do not control all the action: the fun is in putting your Sims in interesting social situations, then standing back and watching what they'll do. When Rooster Teeth's Matt Hullum builds a virtual set and puts the \"Strangerhood\" characters in place for a shoot, he's never quite sure what will happen. To shoot a scene in which two men wake up in bed together, Hullum had to spend hours playing with the two characters -- who are nominally heterosexual -- forcing them into repeated conversations until they eventually became such good friends they were willing to share a bed. Shooting machinima with Sims is thus maddeningly like using actual, human stars: they're stubborn; they stage hissy fits and stomp off to their trailers. \"We'll do three or four takes of a scene, and one of the Sims will start getting tired and want to go to sleep,\" Hullum said. \"It's just like being on a real set. You're screaming: 'Quick, quick, get the shot! We're losing light!' \" Hullum showed me a typical \"Strangerhood\" scene. He put Nikki, a young ponytailed brunette in a baseball cap, in the kitchen to interact with Wade, a slacker who looked eerily like a digital Owen Wilson. (To give Wade a mellow, San Francisco vibe, Hullum programmed him to move at a pace 50 percent slower than the other characters.) Hullum pointed to Nikki's \"mood\" bar; it was low, which meant she was in a bad mood and wouldn't want to talk. \"When they're bored, you have to lock them in a room alone for a few hours until they start to crave conversation,\" Hullum said. He tried anyway, prodding Wade to approach her and talk about food, one of Nikki's favorite subjects. It worked. The two became engrossed in a conversation, laughing and gesticulating wildly. \"See, this footage would be great if we were shooting a scene where these guys are maybe gossiping,\" Hullum mused, as he zoomed the camera in to frame a close-up on Wade. Then Nikki started to yawn. \"Oh, damn. See -- she's getting bored. Oh, no, she's walking away,\" Hullum said, as the little virtual Nikki wandered out of the room. \"Damn. You see what we have to deal with?\" The audience for \"The Strangerhood\" has not exploded the way \"Red vs. Blue\" did. The project is a gamble: its creators hope it will break out of machinima's geeky subculture and vault into the mainstream. Though in a way, Hullum said, the mainstream isn't always a fun place to be, either. Before he returned to Austin to work on \"Red vs. Blue,\" he spent six miserable years in Hollywood working on second-rate teen movies with big budgets, like \"Scooby-Doo\" and \"The Faculty.\" \"So now to come to this, where we have total creative control of our own stuff, it's amazing,\" Hullum said, as he watched Nikki walk out of the house in search of a more interesting conversation. \"I just pray we can keep this going. Because if we can't, I'm in big trouble.\" Clive Thompson is a contributing writer for the magazine."

                "SYNTHETIC WORLDS The Business and Culture of Online Games. By Edward Castronova. 332 pp. University of Chicago Press. $29. SMARTBOMB The Quest for Art, Entertainment and Big Bucks in the Videogame Revolution. By Heather Chaplin and Aaron Ruby. 287 pp. Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill. $24.95. Here's a theory that may be neither original nor empirically defensible but feels true: The more fun an activity is, the less interesting it is to read about. War producces great journalism; water-skiing does not. Can you guess where video games fall on this spectrum? In the last few years, a great many words have been expended to report on this flourishing cultural phenomenon. Most accounts begin with a hyperactive presentation of statistics, which we will not rehearse here. This is all you need to know (and perhaps already do): Video games have grown into a huge business, outpacing the movie industry and bulldozing childhood as we knew it. We adults are not safe, either. Whether they admit it or not, you probably have friends who can be found awake at 2 a.m. disemboweling orcs, foiling terrorist plots and scooping up fumbles and running them into end zones. It is the opinion of Edward Castronova, author of \"Synthetic Worlds,\" that such electronic experiences are not merely a hedge against boredom but a profound indicator of where the entire world is heading. Online, off-line; reality, fantasy -- these distinctions will cease to matter as more and more of us pass our time in virtual environments. Economies will evolve as we pay real money for virtual goods and vice versa. Conflicts that begin online will spill into the real world and back. Laws will be written to protect our newfound interests. Castronova's vision has elements of both utopia and dystopia. But mostly he is bullish. Life in these alternative zones may eventually become so fulfilling, he contends, \"that a fairly substantial exodus may loom in the distance.\" He means this, really. Like the Irish and Italians who left their native lands in the late 19th century to come to America, gamers could create a genuine human migration, away from the real and into the virtual. What will be real then? The specific object of Castronova's scholarship is Mmorpgs, the inelegant acronym for \"massively multiplayer online role-playing games,\" which can involve hundreds of thousands of players plugging in from all over the world. A disproportionate number of these games revolve around dwarfs, wizards, quests and magic lands, though the content is becoming ever more diverse. These days, there's a Mmorpg out there to suit the interests of just about anybody. One game, The Sims Online, merely simulates suburban life, and it is madly popular. Castronova is an economist who teaches telecommunications at Indiana University, and among academic economists he is a bold contrarian, if only because he dares to take computer games seriously. My oh my does he take them seriously. In dense, lifeless prose, he sledgehammers away at his major themes, constantly pausing to review the material he's just covered and preview what is to come. His sweeping conclusions are intriguing -- get ready for governments sending agents into virtual worlds and waging war with avatars! -- but he's not a vivid enough writer to animate most of his futuristic abstractions. In \"Smartbomb,\" Heather Chaplin and Aaron Ruby try harder to entertain. They've organized their history of video games as a study of ambitious individuals, breaking it down into a series of breezy, magazinelike profiles of uneven quality. A lot of the original reporting seems to take place at gaming conventions, which is not where one imagines the really interesting stuff happens. But the stories are pretty good, even when they don't break new ground. Rereading the legend of Nolan Bushnell and the founding of Atari is like hearing a bar band play a spirited \"Twist and Shout\" -- enjoyable, but no additional points for Degree of Difficulty. In two spots, though, Chaplin and Ruby really score. In their chapter on Mmorpgs, they sensitively profile David Reber, a 30-year-old Californian who spends every free moment chained to his computer, acting out a series of intense fantasy existences that provide him with the companionship and sense of achievement missing in his real life. Just as Castronova would predict, Reber withdraws from the real world as his fantasy life deepens -- he has lapses at work and when Chaplin and Ruby last check in with him, he's moved back in with his mother. The other winning portrait in \"Smartbomb\" is of Will Wright, the creator of SimCity, as well as its offshoot The Sims, and a new simulation called Spore in which players guide a new creature from its biological origin onward. In an industry that mimics Hollywood's craven predilection for cheap, gory theatrics, Wright stands apart as a humble philosopher in love with the potential of games to expand the human experience. Though Chaplin and Ruby don't have much to say themselves about the significance of video games, they wisely hand matters over to Wright, who foresees a future that might just keep us all staying up past 2 a.m. \"I think one thing that's unique about video games is not only that they can respond to you but down the road they'll be able to adapt themselves to you. They'll learn your desires,\" he says. \"It might just be that games become deeply personal artifacts -- more like dreams.\" Video Game Books Hugo Lindgren is the editorial director of New York Magazine."

                "THE great thing about shopping for video games is that the person you're buying the gift for almost certainly knows more about it than you do. If you have gamers in your life, no matter what age, odds are that they already know exactly what they want. You need only shut up and fork over the credit card. You can use this to your advantage. If you are lucky enough that the gamer on your list has said anything recently about a game or game machine that is not Microsoft's new Xbox 360, the smart move is to drop whatever you're doing right now and buy it. That way, you will not be among the hordes this holiday season already wondering if they can afford to miss a car payment, or maybe a mortgage installment, to satisfy their 360-craving gamer. That is because the 360, with its snazzy graphics and slick online interface, has emerged as the It gift of the 2005 holiday season. Theoretically, the 360 is supposed to cost $300 for a basic unit and $400 for the deluxe version. In reality, the console is sold out across the country and is now fetching $1,000 or so on eBay. And that's before you buy any games, which run up to $60 each. So if your favorite gamer is interested in anything else this year, consider yourself fortunate. Thankfully, forgoing the 360 doesn't mean returning to the Stone Age of, say, Pong. There are still excellent games being made for the current generation of home game consoles -- Sony's PlayStation 2, Nintendo's GameCube, and the original Xbox, which each cost less than $200 -- and Sony's $250 PSP headlines the strong current crop of hand-held units. Moreover, if you have a powerful PC, that may still be your most capable game machine. In any case, both Sony and Nintendo have new game consoles on the way next year. And availability of the 360 is sure to improve in early 2006. There is a chance that Microsoft could show up with a \"surprise\" boatload of additional 360's in the next few weeks. (The word from the company is that it is working as hard as it can to get units to retailers.) Unless you're willing to pay the prices on eBay or other auction sites, the best advice to shoppers who absolutely must have a 360 is to get themselves on waiting lists at as many retailers and Web sites as possible. So those folks you saw camped out on sidewalks before the 360 went on sale on Nov. 22 don't look so silly now, right? Waiting in line for a midnight sale at a Wal-Mart in Moline, Ill., Kara Harvell told The Quad-City Times that she wanted to buy the console for her five sons. Deliciously, the newspaper reported that Ms. Harvell, a nursing school student, \"got out of class by telling her professor that her son wasn't feeling well at school.\" Of course, some people don't like waiting in line. In the (very) few days before the machine sold out, scattered reports emerged of shoppers being held up for their 360's as they left stores. Please don't go robbing anyone. But if you've already gone through the effort of finding a 360 at its regular price, it is certainly worth the extra $100 for the higher-end model. The full version comes with a headset (for making free phone calls over the Internet to other Xbox users), a wireless controller (instead of a wired model) and a hard drive, which you need to play games made for the original Xbox. Top-line games are $50 to $60. The unit comes with a free basic membership to Microsoft's online game service, which lets you talk to other online 360 users and compare scores. But if you want to actually play head-to-head live over the Internet, you need to buy the \"gold\" membership, which costs $8 a month or $50 a year. In addition to playing games with eye-popping graphics, the machine plays DVD's and can display photos from your digital camera on your regular or high-definition television. Luckily, the 360 is not the only game system potentially worth buying this holiday season. There are cheaper and more readily available options, too. Besides the Xbox 360, the other major new game machine is Sony's PSP hand-held. The sleek black unit has a clear, colorful screen that is far more vibrant than one would expect from a hand-held device, and that may be why people on buses and trains seem to be using their PSP's to watch movies as much as playing games. Dozens of movies are now being released on the small UMD data discs that slip into the back of the PSP, which inexplicably comes with white headphones reminiscent of those supplied with Apple's iPods. Over all, the games for the PSP have been lackluster so far, but that trend shows signs of changing. Aimed at adults, the new Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories takes advantage of the PSP's built-in wireless capability to allow multiple PSP users to battle one another through the game's streets and alleys, even as the players themselves are on the go. Next year, a new installment of the quirky family-friendly Japanese game Katamari Damacy is expected for the PSP. Even cheaper and smaller than the PSP is Nintendo's DS hand-held, which costs about $130. Nintendo has long been popular with young gamers, but the new Nintendogs pet simulator is finding fans among both children and adult women. The screens on the DS, which stands for dual screen, are not quite as impressive as the PSP's, but are still clear enough for enjoyable gaming. But rather than play on the go, many people still prefer their video games on the television in the den. With all of the hype around the 360 it is easy to overlook that you can now buy the original Xbox or Sony's PlayStation 2 each for around $150. Bundles that include a console and a few games can be found under $300 on the Web. Nintendo's GameCube console now costs only around $100. Of course, the Xbox, GameCube and PS2 certainly don't have the cachet of the new 360. And most serious gamers already have one, two or even all three of the older systems. But if you are looking for a cost-effective way to introduce a young person to gaming, buying any of the older systems is a smart move. In fact, many serious gamers would argue that the games being made now for those mature machines are actually better than those for the 360, which is still so new that developers have not yet figured out how to fully harness its power. The older games just don't look quite as snazzy. But until Sony's PlayStation 3 and Nintendo's Revolution are released next year, the Xbox 360 is clearly the best gaming machine around (unless you want to consider a top-notch gaming PC, which could easily cost more than $2,000). If someone you know wants a 360 and you can't find it at a reasonable price, perhaps fend them off with a PSP or a gift certificate that can be exchanged for some new games for an existing console. Then promise you'll get a 360, PlayStation 3 or Revolution next year. You may forget the promise, but they won't. Is It Live, or Is It A Video Game? THERE are about 20 games available for Microsoft's new Xbox 360. It does not have a single hit title yet, as Halo became for the original Xbox, and the lineup is still missing some genres, like role-playing games. Nonetheless, games out now do a good job of demonstrating how the next generation of consoles deliver visual and social experiences far more sophisticated than those possible on older consoles. The strongest two genres on the 360 are auto racing and first-person shooters. On the racetrack, Project Gotham Racing 3 lets you speed through detailed recreated cities like New York, Las Vegas and London. You can race in online leagues, compete against \"ghosts\" that simulate your friends' best performances or \"tune in\" and watch from the sidelines as some of the best virtual drivers in the world go wheel to wheel. The shooters put a player in the perspective of a person fighting, often with guns. Among the standouts are Perfect Dark Zero, set in the near future, and Call of Duty 2, a gritty re-creation of World War II. The most visually impressive 360 game is Kameo: Elements of Power, an action adventure that looks like child's play, with its evocation of a Pixar animated film, but is challenging at points. About half the games for the 360 mimic real-life sports. NBA 2K6, which at times could pass for a live telecast, is the most impressive of the bunch. Amped 3, a snowboarding simulator, is easy to play and gorgeous to watch. SETH SCHIESEL"

                "Tomorrow the Xbox, the new video-game console from Microsoft, arrives in stores on the heels of a $500 million marketing blitz. But it doesn't seem as if much of that money is going to the thousands of musicians who have provided the company with songs to use in the games that will be played on it. Though a band can typically make $10,000 to $20,000 when a song is included in a video game, Microsoft has been asking musicians to contribute their music to video games for pennies -- and in some cases no money at all, with no upfront fee and no royalties on the back end. Musicians, from small, independent punk bands to major-label artists, have been accepting this deal, hoping for the promotional boost that comes with being heard in a game that is played obsessively by teenagers across the country. Joining a band is not a lucrative career choice for most musicians. Many who are signed to major labels spend their careers in debt to those record companies, trying to earn back advances and expenses. But the increasing use of contemporary songs in movies, video games and advertisements has meant an unexpected windfall for lesser-known and midlevel artists. Microsoft, however, is changing that dynamic. ''I asked if we could get any money, and they just said no,'' said Larry Cooper, who runs Revelation Records, a punk, metal and hardcore label that has several songs on the soundtrack to Amped, a snowboarding game. ''I almost thought that out of principle, if there's no payment, we shouldn't do that kind of stuff. But I didn't want to snip out an opportunity for a band that might want to do that kind of promotion.'' Of the bands Mr. Cooper asked, all but one agreed to provide free music to Microsoft. ''I think they were just looking for cheap music, and that's why they called a lot of small labels,'' Mr. Cooper continued. ''I asked them who else was on the soundtrack and made some suggestions, but they said they wanted to stick with certain labels because they didn't have to pay for licensing.'' Brenner Adams, a product planner on Amped, said that on his game Microsoft was looking not for cheap music but for an opportunity to expose as many small underground bands as possible. Under Microsoft policy the interview with Mr. Adams was conducted with a company publicist on the line, taking notes on the conversation. ''We're not saying, 'Hey, we want to use your music for nothing,' '' Mr. Adams said. ''We said, 'Hey, we really want to promote these artists and promote who they are and what they stand for.' '' Though Microsoft didn't give any money to musicians on such independent labels, it did offer small amounts to bands on major labels. It made a deal with Virgin Records, obtaining songs from acts like the Gorillaz, Iggy Pop, the Chemical Brothers and Timbaland & Magoo by paying ''small fees and publishing,'' said Brad Fox, the director of artist development at Virgin. The amount of course remains a big contrast to the millions of dollars that Microsoft is believed to have paid to use Madonna's ''Ray of Light'' in its 60-second Windows XP advertisement. ''We're looking at this as a marketing exercise,'' Mr. Fox said. ''There's no way I could get 10 to 15 different artists in somebody's house in front of an active consumer audience for 20 hours a week. If I could get 20 percent of those kids to go buy a record, that's great.'' But the Xbox isn't like other systems, nor are these deals like other deals. Many record labels are operating on the faith that Microsoft will make efforts to promote their bands. Mr. Fox said he hoped that the Virgin artists used in the games would be mentioned in Xbox promotional material, game catalogs and game boxes. But a trip to the Xbox Web site showed that the artists on games like Amped were not mentioned on the box or promotional poster shown online, nor were the bands on any game highlighted in any special way on the Web site. Other promotional efforts, however, have been made: there was a link at the site to a radio station playing music from Amped, and at a recent Xbox promotional party in Los Angeles Microsoft gave away a CD with music from Amped. Mr. Adams noted that most of the cash deals were made with better-known bands that don't need the publicity as much. ''So,'' he said, ''why not turn the decision around, bring the smaller guys up and give them the promotion they can't get anywhere else?'' He said that music from some 240 artists was used on Amped, that in the game the names of the record labels are shown on banners and that players had the option of seeing names of the bands, songs and record labels. He added that the company hoped to stage more promotions with the music. But there is no guarantee that gamers will hear much if any of the music of these bands. That is because in a feature unique to the Xbox consumers have the option of wiping out the soundtrack to a game and replacing it with music from their own CD's. Originally music executives were less worried about artists not getting paid than about the potential for Xbox to become a new Napster, since it has a large hard drive and online capabilities. But in a statement prepared for this article Microsoft said that though music could be stored on the hard drive, it could not be copied on ''CD's, MP3's or any other devices.'' Other executives in the music publishing business now worry that video game manufacturers and even advertising agencies will follow Microsoft's lead and tell bands that in exchange for use of their music at no cost, an extra effort will be made to promote the groups in products and commercials. As it is, artists sacrifice a lot of money and time at the altar of promotion, taking on costly and inconvenient tasks gratis, like performing concerts promoted by radio stations. So, some wonder, in a field in which just about anything musicians do can be seen as raising their profiles, where is the line between promotional and paid work? Jeff Koz, the chief executive of SubZero, a company that brokers deals between advertisers and musicians, said, ''We believe that people should be paid for what they do.'' Mr. Koz has worked with Microsoft on music and sound design. He added, however, that there was a give-and-take between payment and promotion, and lesser-known artists were often given somewhat lower fees in exchange for what could be career-enhancing exposure. ''There's value to cross-promotion,'' he said, ''and we're not privy to how those Microsoft deals went down. Some of those bands might see it as a tremendous opportunity.'' No. 1 and Dropping The new Britney Spears album, ''Britney,'' will enter the pop charts next week at No. 1 with 769,000 copies sold, according to Soundscan, a company that tracks retail sales. The number, a significant drop from the first-week sales of her previous album (1.3 million), reflects a teenage pop demand that is slipping but still hanging on tenaciously as Ms. Spears sagely remakes her image so she has one foot in the teenage world and the other in the general pop market (an approach best summed up by her song title ''I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman''). The following week, record executives say, ''Britney'' seems likely to slip to No. 2 when the Garth Brooks album ''Scarecrow'' makes its debut with predicted sales of more than one million copies."

                "LOS ANGELES — Microsoft, seeking to expand offerings on its Xbox 360 console, has reached an agreement with a company headed by Peter Safran, the veteran Hollywood producer and talent manager, to produce original shows for distribution on the system. Through his Safran Co., he represents clients like the actor and producer Sean Combs (\"Monster's Ball\"), the actor and writer Nia Vardalos (\"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\") and the filmmakers Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer (\"Epic Movie\"). Safran founded the company in 2006 after leaving Brillstein-Grey Management. Speaking by telephone last week, Scott Nocas, global marketing manager for programming of the Xbox Live entertainment service, said he expected similar deals to follow. \"We definitely look at this as the first of many,\" said Nocas. In an interview at his office in Los Angeles last week, Safran said his first round of programs would be scripted and would probably run under 10 minutes. He said his initial focus would be on genres like comedy and horror that appeal to the Xbox 360 audience, which is heavily concentrated from the ages of 14 to 34, and tends to be more male than female. The first shows are expected to be available to viewers by autumn in the Northern Hemisphere. \"The Xbox is unique; it operates at a level outside of what we generally consider Web entertainment,\" Safran said, referring to the system's tight demographic base, which is defined by the appeal of signature games like the Halo series. The new shows will be available exclusively via the Xbox 360 for a time, then may appear elsewhere, Safran said."

                "Looking for an advantage in the next round of the video-console wars, Microsoft has made the first move. Three and a half years after it entered the console market with the Xbox, Microsoft yesterday unveiled its successor, the Xbox 360, a creamy white console that is to go on sale in North America, Europe and Japan by the holiday season. Though noticeably smaller than its squat black predecessor, the console houses three 3.2-gigahertz I.B.M. microprocessors that could qualify it as the most powerful home computer on the market. Indeed, unlike the original Xbox, the new console can act as a home entertainment hub, streaming pictures, music and video from digital cameras, portable music players and computers that run Microsoft Windows XP. Most evidently different, Xbox 360, which Microsoft introduced last night in a 30-minute presentation on MTV, is designed to display games in wide-screen, high-definition format as well as in standard definition. Microsoft's move, after years of secrecy, rumors and fragmentary disclosures, comes as its competitors -- Sony, the undisputed industry leader, and Nintendo, a close third worldwide -- are also preparing presentations of their coming consoles for the Electronic Entertainment Expo, a major industry trade show, in Los Angeles next week. Representatives of those companies said their game systems, Sony's PlayStation 3 and Nintendo's, which is code-named Revolution, are set for release next year. For the game industry, with $10 billion a year in sales in the United States alone, the consoles' arrivals will not only give rise to new demand for game hardware but will set off a new wave of game development and purchases. As the consoles put new emphasis on high-definition video, they may stimulate TV sales as well. One analyst, describing the anticipation surrounding the announcements, said it was as if Detroit released a new line of automobiles only once every four or five years. \"The business is getting bigger, the stakes are getting higher, and there is such a big leap in technology, potentially making the games ever more realistic and involving,\" said Anita Frazier, entertainment industry analyst for NPD Funworld. Microsoft did not disclose the pricing of its new console. Since their introductions, the current Xbox and Sony's PlayStation 2 have dropped in price from $300 to $150 in the United States; Nintendo's GameCube, originally $200, is now $100. When Xbox arrived in 2001, it was heralded as the most powerful of the consoles and had innovations including a built-in hard drive and an Ethernet port for online play. The machine's biggest hits have been the Halo games, published by Microsoft itself; Halo 2, released last fall, has sold 6.3 million copies. Xbox has also developed a following among game developers, who have been drawn to its power. Still, even with 20 million consoles sold, Xbox has been far outdistanced by Sony's PlayStation 2, with sales of 80 million and 70 percent of the world market. While Halo 2's success put Microsoft's games unit in the black for one quarter last year, the Xbox effort has yet to provide sustained profitability. \"Xbox 1 was very much ready, fire, aim,\" said J Allard, corporate vice president at Microsoft and a leading architect of the Xbox effort. \"We had 19 months and a day between the day we approved the project to the day we were on store shelves.\" For the new Xbox project, Mr. Allard said his team had twice that time and aimed at conceiving a \"magical product\" that was so well integrated it would seem the creation of a single mind. In sheer computing power, the new Xbox is capable of a trillion calculations per second, many orders of magnitude above the original Xbox. (The current box depends mainly on a 733-megahertz processor.) The heat generated by all that power will be drawn off by a water-based cooling system, something usually seen only in high-end PC's. It will also include a redesigned wireless game controller. A Web camera, code-named Cyclops, and a TV-like remote control will be optional. Peter Moore, a Microsoft corporate vice president for worldwide sales and marketing, said Xbox 360 would be especially suited for wide-screen high-definition television and Digital Dolby 5.1 multichannel sound, a requirement for all Xbox 360 games. He added that the new console would also be more seamlessly integrated with Xbox Live, the service that connects games and gamers over high-speed Internet connections for multiplayer action. Xbox Live, which has 1.4 million subscribers, will include a new tier that waives the $6 monthly fee. A demonstration of the console's power delivered stunningly realistic scenes that were indistinguishable at some points from live-action video. \"We have to continue to feed that core audience,\" Robert J. Bach, senior vice president and chief Xbox officer at Microsoft, said of the most ardent gamers. \"But part of the challenge of this next generation is how do we cultivate a broader mass audience.\" Part of that strategy, he said, includes designing Xbox 360 to perform a range of nongaming functions suited to the living room, like streaming digital music and pictures, or videoconferencing. In addition to playing DVD's, as the current Xbox does, it can rip songs from CD's onto a 20-gigabyte hard drive -- a hard drive that can be removed, upgraded and interchanged with other 360 consoles. Judging by dozens of Web sites dedicated to interest in next-generation consoles, expectations are soaring that Xbox 360's competitors will also provide vastly improved graphics, sound and game playing. For example, it is widely believed that Sony's PlayStation 3, which will use a new cell processor technology, will be the most powerful. Molly Smith, a Sony spokeswoman, would not discuss hardware specifics of the PlayStation 3. But she did say that it would be able to deliver \"a quantum leap\" in gaming and electronic entertainment. Nintendo, struggling to shed an image that its technologies mostly appeal to children, is preparing to deliver a game console that is radically different from the cute and cuddly GameCube. Perrin Kaplan, Nintendo's vice president for corporate affairs, said GameCube's successor would be \"very, very sleek.\" She described it as horizontal and no taller than a stack of three DVD cases. Unlike GameCube, the new system will play DVD's, Ms. Kaplin said, and will feature a wireless controller. It will play GameCube games as well as a new class of high-definition games, with new emphasis on online play. Microsoft would not say whether games for the current Xbox would play on Xbox 360. Some industry analysts and game developers said it was likely that games for all three consoles would increase to $60 or $65; the typical price for premium titles on the current machines is $50. \"Over all, the introduction of the next-generation systems will have a very positive impact on the video game industry,\" said Will Kassoy, vice president for global brand management at Activision, a game publisher. \"They will expand the user base and grow software sales.\" Historically, he said, each new cycle of consoles has ushered in a 30 percent rise in the number of players. \"We believe this next generation will see similar growth,\" Mr. Kassoy said. Activision is scheduled to have four games for Xbox 360 at the start, including some of the company's best-selling series -- Tony Hawk, Call to Duty and Quake. Simon Jeffery, president of Sega, said his company would have two titles for Xbox 360 for the holiday season -- Condemned: Criminal Origins and Full Auto -- emphasizing that they will take advantage of the new console's increased power. \"Every successive jump in technology affords new elements of games,\" he said. \"We now will have processing power to do things we haven't been able to do before.\""

                "Sending voice and Webcam picture messages to fellow Xbox 360 players over Microsoft’s Xbox Live service is a cinch, but tapping out old-fashioned text messages using the 360’s onscreen keyboard isn’t much fun. A new $30 miniature keyboard called the Chatpad speeds up text entry to let you best even the fastest BlackBerry touch-typists.  The Chatpad, to go on sale Sept. 6, attaches to the underside of the 360’s controller without interfering with the controller’s comfortable feel in the hands. A backlight makes typing during late-night Gears of War campaigns easier on the eyes, and a dedicated Messenger button activates the 360’s instant messaging program so you can taunt your enemies without breaking from the action. Unfortunately you can’t use the keyboard to type a letter and jump to the corresponding spot in long lists of Xbox Live movie downloads or songs stored on an iPod connected to the 360. Instead, you need to hold down the scroll button. Albert Penello, director for global marketing for Xbox, said the company was looking into a way to add this feature. "

                "FORGET horsepower, forget miles per gallon: the key metric for judging the Nissan Urge, a design study to be introduced today at the North American International Automobile Show in Detroit, is polygons per second, an index of performance for video games. Five hundred million polygons a second is the rating for the Microsoft Xbox 360 video game system tucked away in the car's trunk. It pumps out images fast enough to generate dizzyingly sharp scenes of city streets and speeding cars on a display that folds down from above the windshield. The Urge's key trick is that when parked, its steering wheel and pedals can be used to control the Xbox. The game's soundtrack of roaring engines and screeching tires play through the car's speakers to accompany the action on the screen. Many cars have had video game displays installed in their dashboards. The Urge is the first car to be turned into a game controller -- the tail is now wagging the dog. The Urge, created at Nissan Design America in the La Jolla section of San Diego, is another of the auto industry's seemingly endless quests for \"echo boomer\" customers, a coterie that for carmakers gleams over the horizon the way the mythical city of Eldorado did for the conquistadors. In part, the Urge is a response to an online survey, said John Cupit, a design manager for Nissan. Mr. Cupit interpreted the survey results in the bare, exposed look of the Urge, an articulation of the car's parts aimed, he said, at giving the feel of a motorcycle. The fenders and structure, mostly aluminum, stand out as separate parts. The engine -- a piece of the car so unimportant in this case that Nissan did not even provide the usual specifications of horsepower and torque -- is visible beneath a transparent hood. Nissan calls the look \"minimalism to the maximum.\" The bottoms of the doors are cut away, revealing a surrounding frame of aluminum rendered in \"acid yellow,\" which Anka Mazzei, the color designer, said she chose to express intensity and speed. The front end of the Urge is similar to the GT-R Proto, a concept that Nissan unveiled at the Tokyo auto show last fall. But one should not take the exterior of the Urge too literally. Its weirdness signals that it is unlikely to become a production vehicle. What counts is the concept. Urge is an implicit response to cultural change: young buyers have proved more fascinated by the innovations of their new cellphones, hand-held devices and video games than by the automotive advances that captivated their parents. The showcase game for the Xbox 360 is a special edition of Project Gotham Racing, one of the hit titles for the original Xbox as well. Mr. Cupit said that he and his colleagues at the La Jolla studio spend a lot of time playing on a huge plasma screen. The project was a joint effort with Microsoft, so the Xbox 360 beneath the boattail- shape trunk, one of a half-million consoles shipped since the game system went on sale Nov. 22, is different from the others: no one stood in line to buy it. Video gaming is not the only technology incorporated into the Urge. In addition to the Xbox 360, there is an iPod docking station and a cellphone that doubles as a \"smart key\" to start the engine. In at least one respect, the Urge might be the perfect car: it burns no gasoline while parked for game playing; it generates no emissions; it lines up in no traffic jams. It can virtually roll through the streets of Las Vegas or spin around the Nürburgring. Its version of Gotham Racing can even run uptown on the parts of Broadway that are one-way heading downtown, a special thrill for Manhattan drivers. With a wireless connection, in theory, two Urges could be parked side-by-side for competition like the old racing games at the arcade in Atlantic City. Thanks to the Internet, the same thing could be done even if the Urges were half a world apart. The game encourages stylish driving. Good driving through the curves earns the driver style points, called Kudos, that can be redeemed for a better vehicle. According to the Microsoft programmers, power sliding, pulling off a 360-degree spin, getting air time, drafting and getting up on two wheels \"will earn gamers Kudos points for their style and skill.\" Too bad the real automotive world doesn't work this way. Each car in the game is made up of 80,000 polygons and takes eight days of programming by its creators, who are holed up in the London studio of Bizarre Creations. Real-world details include gauges that move and realistic bug-smash streaks on the windshield. Oddly, the Urge itself is not among the cars you can drive on the screen. That will probably be remedied soon. Project Gotham players and programmers regularly produce new cars that can be downloaded. The Urge's notion of car-as-video game is not unprecedented. A similar concept, the Scion Speedster -- a red Scion xA show car built by 5 Axis Productions in Huntington Beach, Calif. -- was displayed at the Specialty Equipment Market Association trade show in Las Vegas last fall. The Speedster also has an open panel in the doors -- and two Xboxes running the Forza racing game onboard. The two cars simply evolved at the same time, Mr. Cupit said. He prefers his version of the idea. \"We tried to take seriously designing the door glass to protect the occupants from wind and rain, and also vehicle ingress-egress,\" he said. \"Our door moves up and down to ease entry into the car, for example.\" \"We often visit tuner and customizing shows to see what young people are thinking about,\" Mr. Cupit said. \"The Urge helps reinvent the sports car for the next generation of young people.\" Observing young people at auto shows, it is impossible not to note that they pay more attention to how their cars look and sound than how fast they go. The investment tends to go into electronics and colorful bolt-on parts, rather than into making the engine run faster and more furious. Maybe more automakers should put Xboxes in their cars. General Motors and Ford might stir up interest by tucking Xbox 360's into all their trunks."

                "REDMOND, Wash. — Microsoft is betting it has a new way to win the wallets of consumers. The company on Tuesday introduced the new version of its Xbox video game console. The Xbox has been one of Microsoft’s few undeniable consumer hits of the last decade, a product that was not just a credible entry into the games business but also a sign of the innovation possible at a company that is rarely seen as an inventive thinker. “I think of Xbox as the accidental success out of Microsoft,” said James McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester Research, who added that the connection Microsoft has formed with the players of its current Xbox is “much deeper than any relationship Microsoft has ever achieved before.”  The new console, the Xbox One, will enter a market very different from the one its predecessor, the Xbox 360, entered nearly eight years ago, when there was no iPad, smartphones had keyboards and mobile gaming devices were primitive at best.  Today, video games can be played almost anywhere, on any device, with the biggest possible audience of online friends and without the aid of a costly gaming console. The last year or two has been bumpy for Microsoft’s consumer efforts. The Windows 8 operating system software and the Surface tablet-computing devices got a tepid reception from the public when they went on sale last fall.  The company’s mobile phone efforts have been largely ignored. And even Bing, Microsoft’s Internet search engine, has failed to close a wide gap with Google, the market leader.  Microsoft, though, could see better results with the Xbox. With it, it hopes it can reassert the living room as the place where people can still get the best gaming experience, complete with eye-popping graphics and innovative methods for controlling games. It is also a place where Microsoft’s technology can be at the center of a home entertainment system and the funnel through which people gain access to online video. Microsoft has sold more than 76 million of the device’s current incarnation, the Xbox 360 worldwide, compared with almost 100 million Wii consoles from Nintendo and more than 70 million PlayStation 3s from Sony.  The company also controls what may be the most valuable asset in console gaming, Xbox Live, a subscription-based online service with 48 million members who use it to play games against one another and watch movies.  “You can do a lot of things on the phone and a lot of things on tablets,” said John Taylor, an analyst at Arcadia Investment. But, he said, “you can’t do the same kinds of things on those devices” that you can on a television screen. Microsoft plans to develop its own original, live-action television series, which will be accessible through the Xbox. The series will be made in partnership with the director Steven Spielberg and will be based on the popular Halo video game franchise.  The company is also working with the National Football League to develop an app for Xbox that lets players interact with their fantasy football teams while watching a live game. In an interview, Don A. Mattrick, the president of Microsoft’s interactive entertainment business, said that he recognized the growing appeal of mobile devices for gaming and that Microsoft would aggressively tie smartphones and tablets into the experience of using its console. He became most animated when talking about the possibilities of the new Xbox for providers of video programming. “We’re going to the take the form from a one-way experience pushed through a straw to where you can communicate back and make it interactive,” Mr. Mattrick said.  Even if it is a wild success, the new Xbox is likely to have a bigger impact on consumer perception than it will on Microsoft’s overall sales. The Xbox remains a small slice of the company’s business, which is still dominated by sales of Windows, Office and other software. The company’s games division represented only 4 percent of its operating profit. At an event in a carnival tent on its corporate campus, Microsoft did not say how much the new system would cost or how publishing partners would charge for games, which typically start at around $60 for high-end game consoles.  A major feature of the new Xbox, which is expected to hit store shelves in time for the holiday season, will be a new generation of Kinect, the camera-based motion-control sensor introduced several years ago as an Xbox 360 accessory. The new Kinect will come with every Xbox One. Traditional retail sales of games have come under pressure in recent years as mobile devices like the iPhone and iPad have invaded their turf with free and low-cost games. While many gamers dismiss those offerings as inferior to console games, the games have nevertheless tapped into a huge audience of players who may never have played on an Xbox or Sony’s PlayStation. The games business could use a jolt. Total United States retail sales of game hardware and software fell 25 percent to $495.2 million in April from $657.5 million a year earlier, according to estimates by NPD Group, a research firm. That figure does not include the sale of downloadable content over the Internet. Alex St. John, an entrepreneur who worked on Microsoft’s pre-Xbox game efforts, says he is pessimistic about prospects for gaming consoles. “They’re coming out with the latest and greatest stone tool,” Mr. St. John said. “The new console that trumps the old console is called the Apple iPad. This generation of kids loves mobile games.”"

                "Three months after surprising the video game industry with strong sales of its first console, the Microsoft Corporation will dispatch its chairman, Bill Gates, to Tokyo this week to introduce its assault on an inhospitable Japanese market. Not since the industry's early days, when Atari competed for space in video arcades, has a major American game company tried to dethrone Japanese hardware makers on their own turf. When it begins selling its Xbox game system in Japan on Friday, Microsoft will try to use the star power of Mr. Gates and a lineup of specialized games to battle the leaders, Sony and Nintendo. Many industry insiders predict that the Xbox, which has sold more than 1.5 million units in North America since November, will face tough going in Japan, where American software companies have found tremendous difficulties merely putting their games onto store shelves. ''You are talking about a closed market and going up against two very strong, very entrenched competitors,'' said Heath A. Terry, a game software analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston. ''For Microsoft to expect significant success early on in that market is unrealistic.'' The Xbox has other strikes against it for Japanese consumers, who buy about a third of the world's game products. Analysts worry that the console is too big for the living room in a country where smaller gadgets rule. And at about $260, the Xbox costs $40 more than Sony's PlayStation2 and $75 more than Nintendo's GameCube. Yet analysts and software makers acknowledge that Microsoft, the world's No. 1 software company, managed the North American rollout of the Xbox better than they had expected. They also noted that it has deep pockets and has shown unflagging persistence in entering other businesses. The company has already made one significant adjustment specifically for Japan: after criticism from early testers, it built smaller game controllers, with buttons closer together, to better fit the hands of the average Japanese player. Peter Moore, president and chief operating officer for Sega of America, the American division of the Japanese games publisher, said Microsoft's early success in North America gave the company a fighting chance in Japan and Europe, where the Xbox goes on sale on March 14. ''It's eerily reminiscent of the power of the launch of the PlayStation,'' he said, referring to Sony's first console. ''The way a powerful global company can attack an industry, get under its skin and change an industry.'' Hirohisa Ohura, who runs Microsoft's Xbox division in Japan, said the North American introduction had proved that the company could compete in the video game business. While calling Japan ''the most challenging market'' for the Xbox, he said Microsoft would keep chipping away at its competitors for the loyalty of Japanese game players. ''U.S. companies coming into Japan as a game vendor tended to fail and walk away real quick,'' Mr. Ohura said. ''We're not willing to give up at any point. Once we're in this business, we're in here to win.'' In its quest for the buzz that makes or breaks video games, Microsoft set up hundreds of Xbox kiosks in Tokyo and Osaka earlier this month. And for the introduction on Friday, Mr. Gates himself will stump for the Xbox at an event similar to his appearance last November at the opening of the Toys ''R'' Us store in Times Square. Microsoft began taking advance orders on Feb. 2 for consoles, including 50,000 special edition systems with a translucent case and a silver-plated key chain engraved with the autograph of Mr. Gates -- an accessory that has been mocked on online message boards and game publications. Sony, the consumer electronics giant, has an enormous head start on Microsoft. By Dec. 31, Sony said, it had shipped 25 million of its next-generation consoles, the PlayStation2, including 10 million to North America and 8 million to Japan. ''The burden isn't on our company to compete with them; the burden is significantly on Microsoft to compete with us,'' said Molly Smith, a spokeswoman for Sony Computer Entertainment America, the company's American division. The list of best-selling software is dominated by titles that run on the PlayStation2. Yet while they have capitalized on Sony's success in North America, large American game publishers have found the Japanese market difficult to penetrate and have been forced to cooperate with Japanese publishers to develop games specifically for Japan and have games sold there. Electronic Arts is the No. 1 publisher of PlayStation2 titles in North America, but only No. 7 in Japan. ''The secret in Japan is getting product that's culturally appealing to Japanese consumers,'' said Stan McKee, chief financial officer of Electronic Arts. Microsoft has forged partnerships of its own with more than 90 Japanese publishers, but still faces an uphill battle. Because of Sony's lead, analysts said, Microsoft will consider its introduction a success if it wins close to 20 percent of the Japanese market."

                "Reaching out to millions of aspiring game developers around the world, Microsoft plans today to announce a contest that will award $10,000 and the opportunity to entice millions of eyeballs to the next great digital diversion for the company’s Xbox 360. In addition to the game console’s snazzy graphics, the Xbox Live online service has been the most important component of the Xbox 360’s success since its debut in 2005. And perhaps the most popular aspect of Xbox Live has been the service’s arcade component, which allows users to download and play smaller, relatively simpler games like Uno and Geometry Wars that usually cost less than $10. (By contrast, top-end games can sell in stores for around $60.) The popularity of Xbox Live Arcade has in turn attracted the attention of game developers looking to create the next Tetris or Minesweeper. Late last year, Microsoft introduced a suite of software tools for making so-called casual games called XNA.  And so at a game makers’ convention in San Francisco, Microsoft plans to announce a contest akin to the television show “Project Greenlight” that will award a cash prize and a potential slot on Xbox Live Arcade to the best new game created with XNA tools. The company intends to announce the winner of the contest, called “Dream-Build-Play,” in August.  “This competition highlights the power of XNA and the popularity of the Xbox Live Arcade service with its millions of users,” Aaron Greenberg, Microsoft’s group product manager for the Xbox 360 and Xbox Live, said in a telephone interview.  To help increase the popularity of casual games, Microsoft will also announce the introduction of a new 512-megabyte portable storage device for the Xbox 360. The previous portable storage unit contained only 64 megabytes of data, and so Xbox Live Arcade games had been limited to an official size of 50 megabytes. With the new unit, Microsoft will also raise the official size limit on Xbox Live Arcade games to 150 megabytes, allowing enhanced graphics, sound and artificial intelligence. SETH SCHIESEL"

                "Raising the ante in the video game wars, Microsoft is bringing out a new version of the Xbox 360 game machine that has a bigger hard drive, better high-definition video support and a stylish black finish, not an insignificant feature in a world where looking cool ranks high. The idea is to appeal to an elite class of hardcore game players who would like a little more of everything.   “Today’s games-and-entertainment enthusiast has an insatiable appetite for digital high-definition content,” said Peter Moore, corporate vice president for Microsoft’s interactive entertainment business, in Redmond, Wash.   The Xbox 360 Elite, which is to be announced today and will be in stores in late April, will have a list price of $479, or $80 more than the Xbox 360 Pro and $180 more than the basic Xbox 360. The new model has a 120-gigabyte hard drive, in contrast to the standard model’s 20-gigabyte drive. It also has a high-definition multimedia interface port and cable and a wireless controller and headset. Current Xbox 360 owners can buy the new 120-gigabyte hard drive as a separate accessory for $179.  Microsoft is clearly hoping to fill what it sees as a hole at the top end of the market. The Nintendo Wii has been outselling the PlayStation 3 from Sony and the Xbox 360 in recent months, but that system is largely positioned as a family-friendly game machine that can be purchased for $50 less than the lowest-priced Xbox. The Sony system is priced higher than both the Nintendo and the Microsoft systems, with the cheapest model priced at $499.  Both Microsoft and Sony have positioned their consoles as entertainment hubs, not just for playing sophisticated video games but also for listening to music and viewing downloaded movies and television shows.   John Rodman, group product manager for the Xbox platform and Xbox Live, pointed to a recent Microsoft survey that revealed that nearly 40 percent of the time that Xbox 360 users spent with their consoles was for activities other than gaming.   Yet when it comes to gaming, Xbox 360 users are serious, Mr. Rodman says. Six out of 10 Xbox 360 users use Xbox Live, Microsoft’s online gaming service.   “We don’t feel like the Wii customer and the Xbox customer are the same thing,” he said. “We think that as soon as the Wii customer turns 14 they want something else.”  James L. McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester Research, said that Microsoft hoped to encourage customers to spend more money downloading movies and games, which require considerable hard-drive space. "

                "LOS ANGELES  Reaching out beyond hardcore video game players to everyday consumers, Microsoft outlined an entertainment strategy on Monday for making the company’s Xbox 360 game console a gateway for movies, television and social networking. In a media presentation on the eve of E3, the video game industry’s biggest North American convention, Microsoft announced new relationships with the social networking giants Facebook and Twitter as well as Sky, the big British satellite television provider that is a unit of the News Corporation.  Microsoft announced that Facebook users would be able to access their profiles and share photos on their television through the Xbox Live network and that Twitter devotees would also be able to post and read messages through the service.  More far-reaching was Microsoft’s new deal with Sky, under which Xbox Live users in Britain will be able to watch live television, including professional soccer, over an Internet version of the Sky service. Not every channel available over satellite will be available over Xbox Live, but the offering will include dozens of stations, Microsoft executives said. Users will be able to watch television in a virtual party room with their friends, discussing the program as they are watching, they said.  Microsoft has long sought a bigger role in home television, going so far in years past as to try to build its own set-top box business. Partnering with Sky represents a back door into the television market. The company has also recognized how Nintendo has expanded the traditional audience for video games with its innovative motion-sensitive controller for the Wii. Microsoft provided the first public demonstration of its futuristic Project Natal, which it hopes will usher in an age of completely controller-free gaming.  Using a sophisticated camera, infrared sensors and voice recognition software, Natal allows users to control a game or other programs, like a virtual painting studio, merely by waving their arms, speaking to the system and moving around. Microsoft did not say when the technology would become available. Microsoft also demonstrated some of its coming big games, including Forza Motorsport 3, the suspense-thriller Alan Wake and a new version of its biggest hit, Halo. Hideo Kojima, the developer behind the Metal Gear series, said that the next major installment in that franchise would be available for Xbox 360, a coup for Microsoft because previous Metal Gear games had been exclusive to Sony game machines."

                " NEW YORK — Buyers of the Xbox 360, Microsoft's second-generation video game console, will expect to play big, expensive marquee games like \"Call of Duty 2\" from Activision and \"Madden NFL 06\" by Electronic Arts. But Microsoft is also banking on them to play small arcade-style video games, purchased and downloaded from the Internet. Unlike its competitors, the Sony PlayStation 2 and Nintendo GameCube, the new Xbox, which goes on sale on Nov. 22, can play games on two separate tracks. One is the familiar terrain of big-budget, deeply immersive games that feel more like interactive movies than games. The other is a return to the video game's arcade roots. But the arcade games are not simple, said Greg Canessa, group manager of Xbox Live Arcade, part of the Xbox division.\"Arcade games are really miniature Xbox 360 games,\" he said. The price is somewhat miniaturized as well. To develop the arcade games cost $100,000 to $200,000, compared with $15 million to $20 million for the larger games. The arcade games will be sold only online, downloadable through the Xbox's broadband-only Internet connection. Microsoft has not officially announced prices for the games, but it is widely expected that they will cost $5 to $10. By contrast, new Xbox games sold at retailers like Best Buy are likely to cost $60, or about $10 more than previous Xbox games, according to some game publishers. The new machines, slimmer and more powerful than the original Xbox released in 2001, will cost $300 for a basic model and $400 for a model with a 20-gigabyte hard drive. They will also be able to play DVDs, CDs and standard music files, including MP3 and Windows Media Audio files, as well as display digital snapshots on a TV screen. Those functions and the arcade-type gaming feature are central to Microsoft's strategy to reach a broader family market, beyond the young male players who have been the Xbox's primary audience.To do that, Peter Moore, vice president for marketing at Xbox International, said Microsoft would eliminate the need for credit cards in making online purchases of games, accessories and upgrades. Instead of credit cards, the Xbox Live online service will accept Microsoft value cards that can be bought in various denominations online or at retail and convenience stores, Moore said. The value cards would function, in effect, like tokens in an arcade. \"We have to get credit cards out of the way,\" he said. \"We've got to broaden this to younger demographics.\" Another big selling point for the 360 is its enhanced Internet connectivity through the Xbox Live service.Microsoft will give Xbox 360 owners a free subscription to Xbox Live Silver, which gives players access to the online system's features, including the ability to buy and download games. A Gold membership, at $50 a year, permits users to play games with others over the Internet. Canessa, the group manager of Xbox Live Arcade, said that each arcade game could play at 1080i high definition and that most could take advantage of the 360's ability to communicate with other players over a broadband Internet connection. \"We will have from 12 to 15 games by launch,\" Canessa said. At least 75 percent, he added, will be capable of being played live online by more than one player.Each Xbox 360, he said, will include a free copy of the full version of \"Hexic HD,\" an arcade-style puzzle game developed by Alexey Pajitnov, the creator of \"Tetris.\" \"We created a whole market, a whole new world, for downloadable games,\" Canessa said. While online arcade games have proved popular on personal computers, Canessa said he believed that the 360's embrace of arcade games would further invigorate independent game design. \"The indie game developers is one of the opportunities I'm most excited about,\" he said. \"You have small, independent, three guys in a garage making games, totally innovating. It's the Sundance Film Festival, if you will, of games.\" "

                " SEATTLE — In a bid to make its games unit profitable by 2007, Microsoft is planning to start selling a more expensive version of its Xbox game console this autumn. The premium Xbox 360 console will sell for $399.99 in the United States, nearly three times the price of the current Xbox, according to an announcement made by Microsoft on Wednesday. The premium console will sell for399.99, or $490.67, in Continental Europe, while its scaled-back version, called \"Xbox 360 Core System,\" will sell for $299.99 in the United States and299.99 in Europe. Microsoft is counting on the new releases of its console to make its video game unit profitable by 2007, according to Robert Bach, senior vice president for Microsoft's home and entertainment division. The game unit of Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, has lost $2.8 billion in the last three years, while Sony's rival console, the PlayStation, is profitable. Bach predicted that the Xbox 360 would outsell Sony's PlayStation 3, which is scheduled for release next year, even though the PlayStation 2 has outsold the Xbox by nearly 4 to 1. Various Xbox accessories, like a 20-gigabyte detachable hard drive and a wireless controller that will be delivered with the premium version of the console, will also be available for purchase as an add-on for the less expensive \"core\" console. Microsoft is also planning to sell other Xbox accessories, like a wireless controller and TV remote, a headset for the Xbox Live online service and an Ethernet cable for high-speed Internet connections. The company said that it remained on target to ship the new Xbox to stores in North America, Europe and Japan in time for the upcoming holiday season, ahead of Sony's PlayStation 3, which is slated to replace the PlayStation 2 in the spring. Bach noted that both new versions of the Xbox would support high-definition visuals and play music and movies. These features were not part of the original Xbox release, which cost $299 four years ago but now sells for $150. Matt Rosoff, an analyst at the independent research firm Directions on Microsoft, said he doubted that enthusiasts would balk at the price increase for the new releases.\"Hard-core gamers will be on board,\" Rosoff said. \"I think the sticker shock might be in the larger audience Microsoft is trying to reach,\" like casual game players and neophytes, he added. Microsoft sells its current Xbox console at a loss because its primary goal was to break into the lucrative game market. It makes money selling games, but does not expect its home and entertainment division to post profits regularly until 2007. \"They need to not lose a lot of money on the console this time,\" said Ben Bajarin, an analyst at Creative Strategies in Campbell, California. \"They'd like to get closer to a small margin of profit on the console.\" The core console will not be able to play games designed for the original Xbox unless a consumer spends $99.99 to add a hard drive. Microsoft has asked developers working on future games to make them in such a way that they could be played on both the fully loaded and basic versions of the console. Pricing for the new Xbox in Japan, where Microsoft sells just a few hundred consoles a week, will not be announced until the Tokyo Game Show in September, Bach said. "

                " SAN JOSE, California — The tit-for- tat battle for customers between Sony and Microsoft continued Thursday as the Japanese electronics group announced plans to introduce an online gaming service when its PlayStation 3 video game console is released in the fall. The news of the service, which lets users buy games and communicate and compete with other players via the Web, comes days after Tokyo-based Sony said that it would delay the release of its next-generation PlayStationconsole until November, putting it a year behind Microsoft's popular Xbox 360. The much-awaited start had originally been scheduled for the spring and the news, on March 15, prompted Microsoft to announce this week that it was more than doubling shipments of the Xbox 360. Phil Harrison, president of worldwide studios for Sony Computer Entertainment, said that the basic level of Sony's online service, known internally as PlayStation Network Platform, would be free, and would allow users to play against each other online, e-mail and chat with friends. Additional game services and premium content will be made available to users who pay a subscription fee, Harrison said. Sony, one of the world's leading technology manufacturers and entertainment companies, is hoping to retain its dominance over the roughly $30 billion global video game market with the PS3. Microsoft introduced the Xbox 360 game console in November. The company's Xbox Live subscription service, which offers game downloads and online play, has been a hit on the new machine and Sony had been widely expected to offer a similar service. Built in collaboration with Sony Online Entertainment, which already offers PC game downloads and a marketplace for trading virtual assets, the service was inspired by businesses like the online auction site eBay and the online retailer Amazon.com, where communities of users contribute ratings and recommendations. It also steals a page from social networking sites like Myspace.com, which has attracted millions of users. \"We have to fall into step with consumer expectations,\" said Harrison, who said the social aspects of the network promise to get people more involved in gaming. With broadband adoption on the rise and television viewership dropping, advertisers are exploring the possibility of buying ad space in games much like they now do on the Web. \"This can provide a tremendous revenue stream for our industry,\" Harrison said. Video game makers, which have seen sales fall as gamers wait and save for new consoles, have been under pressure to find new ways to offset rising game development costs. Microsoft said Tuesday that Xbox Live had logged more than 10 million downloads.More than 85 percent of Xbox 360 consoles that are connected to the Internet have downloaded games, trailers and videos from the subscription service, Microsoft said. Downloads appeal to many game makers, because they can cut costs by selling direct to consumers. Online distribution also gives them a way to head off piracy and used game sales by providing a way to check that the player of a game is also its owner. Anita Frazier, an analyst with NPD Group, a market research company, said most publishers were \"treading lightly\" into direct online sales of games because they do not want to alienate retailers, but added that such services would likely open the market for more games.$@ "

                "Executives at Microsoft are fond of saying that its subscription gaming service, Xbox Live, should be thought of as a cable channel. They want Xbox to be seen not merely as a gaming machine for teenagers, but as a media portal for parents and grandparents, too. The company is even producing shows for users: it is in the middle of the second season of “1 vs. 100,” an interactive version of a game show that was on NBC. The content ambitions do not end there. Microsoft has held in-depth talks with the Walt Disney Company about a programming deal with ESPN, according to people close to the talks, who requested anonymity because the talks were intended to be private. For a per-subscriber fee, ESPN could provide live streams of sporting events, similar to the ones available through ESPN 360, a service that is available from some high-speed Internet providers. Microsoft could also create some interactive games in association with ESPN, the people said. One of the people said the deal was not imminent. The companies declined to comment. Already, video game consoles are putting a new emphasis on the video, rather than the game.  The roughly 20 million monthly members of Xbox Live can surf Facebook, browse an online mall of movies and TV episodes and, if they pay, watch Netflix.  “It’s 20 million connected living rooms,” said Marc Whitten, the general manager of Xbox Live. Similarly, users of the Sony PlayStation can tune into BBC shows and see Weather Channel updates, as well as stream Netflix. Last week, Netflix extended its streaming service to the Nintendo Wii.  Among the many companies that want to transport the on-demand qualities of the Internet into the living room  the over-the-top model, in industry parlance  the console makers have a significant head start. Nearly 60 percent of American homes now have at least one console, according to the consulting firm Deloitte, up from 44 percent three years ago. “For both of the big guys, it’s about extending the value of the hardware platform,” said Mike McGuire, a vice president for the research firm Gartner, referring to Microsoft and Sony. “The devices are hooked to TVs and have broadband connections, and there are more and more opportunities to license movies and TV shows and deliver them in over-the-top models.” Microsoft said this month that it had sold 39 million Xbox 360 consoles around the world. About half sign into Xbox Live each month. At that size, “it starts to feel like a cable network,” said Mark Kroese, who oversees Xbox advertising sales for Microsoft. The company does not specify how many members pay for access to premium services like Netflix; basic functions of Xbox Live are free. The company says it regularly counts more than a million concurrent users  and topped out at 2.2 million at one point during Christmas week last month. That compares favorably to some of the top channels on cable, like TBS and the Cartoon Network, which reach about one million viewers at any given time, according to the Nielsen Company.  The comparisons are crude at best because many of Xbox Live’s users are playing games rather than watching video. No third-party measurement exists, because ratings companies like Nielsen do not yet track the service fully. But there is no doubt that consoles are expanding their domain, something that is evident in Mr. Whitten’s vision of the service: “The entertainment you want, the people you care about, wherever you are.” The addition of Netflix in late 2008 was an important step into the entertainment arena for Xbox, and perhaps a precursor to Microsoft’s current talks with Hollywood producers. Without releasing specific numbers, Mr. Whitten said the streaming movies and TV service were “very, very popular,” including in his own household. Mr. Whitten said Microsoft wanted to be a bigger player in television and film viewing. He declined to comment on the conversations with Disney but said more than once that “there’s going to be a ton of experimentation around business models and rights.” “Our goal is, really, how can we get as much content there as possible,” he said. Disney is not alone in showing an interest in the console market. Many companies sell TV episodes and film rentals through Microsoft’s online store, and Web video ventures are clamoring to have a place on the service. Console makers have a long way to go to be considered replacements for cable subscriptions, but, at the very least, they could put a dent in the time spent viewing traditional TV. The interactive game show “1 vs. 100” drew well over 100,000 concurrent users at times during its first season last year, according to Microsoft’s internal data. During the second season, which began in November, two-hour TV-style trivia competitions are scheduled on Tuesday and Friday nights. A voice-over announcer, shown onscreen as an avatar, provides live color commentary. Like the defunct NBC show, the game has a contestant, “The One,” and a “Mob” of 100 other players. Members of the audience can watch passively or play along, improving their odds of being picked to play for prizes. Unlike on the live-action TV show, every player on Xbox is represented by a cartoonish avatar. Dave McCarthy, a general manager at Microsoft Game Studios, said the scheduled TV-style shows provided a guarantee that “you’re a part of something bigger.” Beyond the game show realm, Microsoft also exclusively shows “The Guild,” a sitcom that it bills as “Seinfeld” meets video game culture. It stars its creator, the actress Felicia Day, and is sponsored by Sprint. For advertisers like Sprint, online communities like Xbox Live are another arena to pursue consumers. Within “1 vs. 100” there are 15- and 30-second commercial breaks like on TV. Those spots account for about 15 percent of the service’s advertising revenue; most of the rest comes from ads on Xbox Live navigation pages, like display ads on Web sites.  In November, Nielsen started to track “1 vs. 100” play and ad views. The pilot program “is the tip of the iceberg,” said Gerardo Guzman, a director for Nielsen Games; eventually, he hopes to generate TV-style ratings. Mr. Kroese said Xbox advertisers were “very interested in being able to compare the media buy on Xbox to other media buys they do.” Microsoft says nearly half of Xbox Live members use its entertainment content; the rest mostly play multiplayer games. But it expects that more of its users will try the entertainment side and the line between them will blur further. “I don’t think there’s a real difference between a game and ‘Lost.’ Or a game and ‘American Idol.’ They’re all ways we spend our leisure time,” Mr. Whitten said.  Over time, he predicted, “these narrow swim lanes  games, music, movies, etc.  will dissolve.”"

But there is no doubt that consoles are expanding their domain, something that is evident in Mr. Whitten’s vision of the service: “The entertainment you want, the people you care about, wherever you are.” The addition of Netflix in late 2008 was an important step into the entertainment arena for Xbox, and perhaps a precursor to Microsoft’s current talks with Hollywood producers. Without releasing specific numbers, Mr. Whitten said the streaming movies and TV service were “very, very popular,” including in his own household. Mr. Whitten said Microsoft wanted to be a bigger player in television and film viewing. He declined to comment on the conversations with Disney but said more than once that “there’s going to be a ton of experimentation around business models and rights.” “Our goal is, really, how can we get as much content there as possible,” he said. Disney is not alone in showing an interest in the console market. Many companies sell TV episodes and film rentals through Microsoft’s online store, and Web video ventures are clamoring to have a place on the service. Console makers have a long way to go to be considered replacements for cable subscriptions, but, at the very least, they could put a dent in the time spent viewing traditional TV. The interactive game show “1 vs. 100” drew well over 100,000 concurrent users at times during its first season last year, according to Microsoft’s internal data. During the second season, which began in November, two-hour TV-style trivia competitions are scheduled on Tuesday and Friday nights. A voice-over announcer, shown onscreen as an avatar, provides live color commentary. Like the defunct NBC show, the game has a contestant, “The One,” and a “Mob” of 100 other players. Members of the audience can watch passively or play along, improving their odds of being picked to play for prizes. Unlike on the live-action TV show, every player on Xbox is represented by a cartoonish avatar. Dave McCarthy, a general manager at Microsoft Game Studios, said the scheduled TV-style shows provided a guarantee that “you’re a part of something bigger.” Beyond the game show realm, Microsoft also exclusively shows “The Guild,” a sitcom that it bills as “Seinfeld” meets video game culture. It stars its creator, the actress Felicia Day, and is sponsored by Sprint. For advertisers like Sprint, online communities like Xbox Live are another arena to pursue consumers. Within “1 vs. 100” there are 15- and 30-second commercial breaks like on TV. Those spots account for about 15 percent of the service’s advertising revenue; most of the rest comes from ads on Xbox Live navigation pages, like display ads on Web sites.  In November, Nielsen started to track “1 vs. 100” play and ad views. The pilot program “is the tip of the iceberg,” said Gerardo Guzman, a director for Nielsen Games; eventually, he hopes to generate TV-style ratings. Mr. Kroese said Xbox advertisers were “very interested in being able to compare the media buy on Xbox to other media buys they do.” Microsoft says nearly half of Xbox Live members use its entertainment content; the rest mostly play multiplayer games. But it expects that more of its users will try the entertainment side and the line between them will blur further. “I don’t think there’s a real difference between a game and ‘Lost.’ Or a game and ‘American Idol.’ They’re all ways we spend our leisure time,” Mr. Whitten said.  Over time, he predicted, “these narrow swim lanes  games, music, movies, etc.  will dissolve.”"

                "LOS ANGELES, July 5 — In what may be one of the costliest consumer warranty repairs in history, Microsoft announced on Thursday that it would spend up to $1.15 billion to repair failing Xbox 360 game machine consoles. While the company would not say how many units were failing, Robbie Bach, president of Microsoft’s entertainment and devices division, said that there have been an “unacceptable high number of repairs.” The majority of Xbox 360 owners, he said, have not experienced hardware failure.  Company officials said that Microsoft had sold 11.6 million Xbox 360 units by the end of June, shy of the 12 million units the company had predicted. The Xbox 360, which first went of sale in November 2005, is currently the best-selling game machine in the United States, according to NPD, a market research firm. The size of the anticipated repair bill suggests that a third to as many as half of the machines are flawed.  Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., said it would take a charge of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion against earnings in the quarter ended June 30. Consumers know they have a problem if three red flashing lights appear on the console. Gamers on online forums have been referring to the event as “the Red Ring of Death” because the machine then shuts down.  The company declined to explain the nature of the failure, but said that it was not caused by a single problem in the console, which it said contained 1,700 components and 500 million transistors. The company also said there were no health or safety concerns involved. The problem began to appear over the last three to four months, Mr. Bach said, after “significant usage” of the consoles. He said the company has taken steps to correct the problem in new devices. Microsoft said it would extend the warranty of the game console to three years to customers worldwide. Previously, products sold in the United States were covered by a one-year warranty, while Xbox 360 units sold in Europe had a two-year warranty.  In addition, customers who have had their consoles repaired because of the “three flashing lights” problem will be reimbursed for the cost of the repairs. Microsoft has succeeded in establishing the Xbox brand against the better known Sony PlayStation and other game machines. The Xbox and its successor, the Xbox 360, was the software maker’s first major foray into hardware. Although sales are small relative to the rest of Microsoft’s revenue, the Xbox has been an important venture for the company and was viewed by many analysts as Microsoft’s attempt to compete with the likes of Sony and Apple for control of electronics and entertainment within homes.  The device can be used to access the Internet and view movies. Microsoft said its entertainment and devices division reported an operating loss of $315 million on $929 million in revenue for the three-month period that ended in March, and analysts have estimated that the company lost about $6 billion getting a foothold in the game machine industry.  A new Xbox 360 with a 20-gigabyte hard drive sells for about $400, but other versions cost about $300.  The announcement comes on the eve of the E3 Media and Business Summit, the video-game industry’s major trade show, to be held next week in Los Angeles. “This is bound to affect discussions between Microsoft and its developers and retailers,” said Richard Doherty, a partner in the research company Envisioneering Group."

                "One of the enduring attractions of comic books and graphic novels is the ease with which they explain the universe. Evil is identifiable, external and fairly simple to vanquish with the application of the appropriate superpowers. And sometimes, as in the case of ABC Family’s new comic-based series “The Middleman,” evil is downright funny. In “Middleman’s” first episode, last week, a slimy, many-eyed, multitentacled creature erupts in a DNA lab. Later, evil’s personification is a mobster ape with a machine gun. These over-the-top creatures are more comic than threatening. Usually the phrase “cartoonish violence” is a pejorative; here it’s a compliment. “The Middleman,” written as a graphic novel by Javier Grillo-Marxuach, who has also written for the series “Lost” and “Medium,” stars Matt Keeslar in the title role, a straight-arrow, milk-drinking former member of the Navy Seals who stands between us and horrors we’re not even aware of, fighting evil “so you don’t have to.” He dresses like a Canadian Mountie and delivers his lines with the stone-face confidence of a young Peter Graves. Early on, he explains the world to his protégée. “You know how in comic books there’s all kinds of mad scientists and aliens and androids and monsters who want to either take over or destroy the world?” he asks. “Well, it really does work like that.” This is news to Wendy Watson (Natalie Morales), an art-school graduate and temp secretary whose calm in the face of the multitentacled slime creature  she stabs it with a letter opener  inspires the Middleman to recruit her. “You’re good under pressure,” he says. She asks, “Are you hitting on me?” There is some sexual tension between these two, but you hope it won’t become a big part of the story; there’s much more interesting material here. “Middleman” is full of hilarious throwaways, as when our hero, preparing to drink a glass of “cool refreshing milk” with some bad guys, empties his pockets  of grenades, flamethrowers and a crossbow.  The genius is in the details. When the Middleman asks Wendy if she has experience with firearms, and she says she’s a pacifist, he looks at her fingers. Their calluses tell him that she is a veteran Xbox player. “You probably have better hand-eye than a bush sniper,” he concludes. “Middleman” skillfully incorporates real-life details into its fantastic scenarios. Its characters aren’t just Manichaean warriors; they also live the kinds of lives that people read comic books to escape from. “Did I get any calls?” Wendy asks her roommate after a rough day at the office. The roommate says: “Yeah. Your mom called to ask if you’re a lesbian.” That would be the mom whom Wendy describes as “on me 24/7 to quit painting, move back to Orlando, meet a good man, eat fried foods, swell up like a tick and start squeezing out calves like Elsie mainlining fertility drugs.” Then there’s the motive of the mad scientist who created the gun-toting ape; she’s just trying to compensate for federal cuts to her research grants. Saving the world is easy; making a world as complex and funny as this one is the real feat of “Middleman.” THE MIDDLEMAN ABC Family, Monday nights at 8, Eastern and Pacific times; 7, Central time. Created by Javier Grillo-Marxuach, based on his Viper Comics graphic novels, with illustrations by Les McClaine; directed by Jeremiah Chechik; Mr. Grillo-Marxuach and John Ziffren, executive producers; Hans Beimler, co-executive producer; Jon Pare, producer; Sarah Watson, co-producer; Mr. Chechik and Tracey Stern, supervising producers.  WITH: Matt Keeslar (the Middleman), Natalie Morales (Wendy Watson), Mary Pat Gleason (Ida), Brit Morgan (Lacey) and Jake Smollett (Noser)."

                "TOKYO, Dec. 16 - In the United States, Microsoft's Xbox 360 video game console has been so popular it is hard to keep on store shelves. But in Tokyo's neon-drenched Akihabara neighborhood, known as Electronics Town, there are plenty of the sleek white machines to go around, if you can find takers. At Yodobashi Camera, an eight-story electronics department store selling everything from hair curlers to home computer servers, a small corner display of Xbox 360's draws little attention from passing shoppers. It is not hard to figure out why. Lined up on a rack near the display are the only nine games sold for Xbox 360. But behind it are some 3,000 games, spread across six store aisles, for Microsoft's biggest rival here, the Sony PlayStation 2. \"Xbox doesn't even have Gran Turismo,\" said Shun'ichi Moriizumi, naming a popular auto racing game. One of the few shoppers to stop in front of the Xbox display, Mr. Moriizumi, a 22-year-old university student, said he came to see the Xbox 360, which went on sale here Dec. 10, 18 days after its debut in the United States. \"I like the graphics,\" he said \"But I'm not going to buy it, at least not today. I'm waiting until the new PlayStation comes out before deciding which to buy.\" That appears to be a common sentiment in Japan, the world's second-largest video game market after the United States. The Xbox 360 had a disappointing opening day in Japan. During the first weekend the Xbox 360 was in stores, Microsoft sold 62,135 of about 159,000 machines shipped, or about 39 percent, according to a Japanese market research company, Enterbrain. That pace was even slower than in 2002, when Microsoft introduced its earlier Xbox model in Japan, where it was considered a flop. Microsoft was hoping to make a bigger splash this time, not just because of the market's size here but also because of Japan's importance as a proving ground for new products. Japan is, after all, home to Microsoft's two biggest rivals in video games, Sony and Nintendo, and its software companies write many of the games played worldwide, from Super Mario Brothers to Final Fantasy. Winning over Japan's finicky consumers, who are known to reject games for seemingly minor shortcomings in performance and appearance, represents a coveted seal of approval, analysts say. So far, Microsoft has failed the test. As of June, the latest data available, 470,000 Xbox machines over all have been sold in Japan, versus 13 million in the United States, according to the market research site Famitsu.com. That gave Xbox a mere 2 percent slice of the 22 million game machines sold in Japan. By contrast, Xbox had a 25 percent share of the 52 million machines sold in the United States, according to Famitsu. Analysts say the biggest hurdle the Xbox 360 faces in Japan is the dominance of Sony and to a lesser extent Nintendo. Sony has 81 percent of the Japanese market; Nintendo has most of the rest, according to Famitsu. Worldwide, PlayStation's market share is about 68 percent; Xbox is in second place with 17 percent and Nintendo has the rest. Microsoft had hoped to steal a march by rolling out its next-generation XBox game machine ahead of its two Japanese rivals. Sony plans to sell its newest game console, PlayStation 3, in the spring, though the company will not say exactly when. Nintendo says it will release its new console, Revolution, in 2006. But Microsoft's strategy does not seem to be working, analysts say. One problem they note is that Microsoft introduced Xbox 360 before there was much game software to play on it. That makes the Xbox 360 less attractive next to the vastly larger number of games available for PlayStation. Microsoft says more games are in the pipeline, including the latest version of the popular Dead or Alive, which is supposed to go on sale here later this month. \"We didn't have a rocket start,\" said Asako Miyata, a spokeswoman in Japan for Microsoft. \"But we see sales steadily picking up as more games become available.\" Analysts say, however, that even when more games appear, Microsoft may have trouble luring first-time buyers because of the need to replace their game software libraries. Because so many consumers now own PlayStation 2, it would be easier for them to wait for the arrival of PlayStation 3, which would be able to play all their current games, . \"Sony has such a high penetration rate,\" said John Yang, an electronics analyst in Tokyo for Standard & Poor's rating agency. \"It is not uncommon for households here to have two or even three PS2's,\" he said, referring to the current PlayStation model. \"Why would an entire household want to switch to Xbox?\" Takashi Sudo, a manager for the video game department at the Yodobashi Camera store, said several hundred people showed up for the opening day of Xbox 360 at his store. But he said he expected a crowd at least five times as large for the PlayStation 3 debut in the spring. For that, he says, he will need to set up a line of special booths to handle the crunch. \"This is Sony's country,\" Mr. Sudo said. \"Xbox has to break into a market that Sony built.\""

                "SANTA MONICA, Calif., July 10 — As Microsoft executives played down the impact of an extensive repair program for defective Xbox 360 game machines, they announced several efforts to broaden the appeal of their machine to families.  Opening the annual E3 game conference here, Microsoft executives announced a deal to distribute films from the Walt Disney Company on Microsoft’s Xbox Live Internet service and outlined a broader array of games focused mostly on children and families.  Executives predicted that the company’s recently announced plan to spend up to $1.15 billion to fix defective Xbox 360 game machine would improve, not undermine, the system’s image with consumers.   “The important impact for us is that our customers know we’re going to support the console and support them and if they have issues, we’ll take care of it,” said Robert J. Bach, president of Microsoft’s entertainment and devices division, in an interview. “It won’t change what’s happening in the marketplace because the industry is about the games and we think we have the games that will get people really excited this year.”  As the game industry’s growth has slowed in recent years, game developers have tried to reach beyond the young male players who have been the target audience.  “We believe we have the best game lineup in video-game history for the holiday season,” said Mr. Bach. “You can look top to bottom and we think we have the goods to please any type of gamer.”  Part of Microsoft’s strategy has been to position the Xbox 360 as a living room media hub and an essential element of that plan has been allowing users to download films and television shows to the machine. Adding Disney to the roster of companies distributing movies and video programming over the Xbox Live service should help broaden the appeal of the game system to families with children. The same could be said of the new games Microsoft announced here, including a new installment of the company’s Viva Pinata game and a version of the Scene It? board game. Scene It? will come with a new controller for the Xbox 360 with large buttons and a simple layout that game novices, intimidated by a traditional game controller, may find easier to use “Part of our strategy is we want to win this generation and in order to do that we have to expand beyond the core gamer audience that we’ve had success with and that means appealing to the broad consumer market,” said Shane Kim, general manager of Microsoft Game Studios. The company also said it was developing a keyboard for the Xbox 360 controller. Currently, Xbox Live users send text messages using an on-screen keyboard. The company recently announced plans to integrate the popular Windows Live Messenger service with Xbox Live.  But even as Microsoft hopes to appeal to new sorts of users, the company wants to avoid neglecting the serious player. So Microsoft also said that the next version of the popular Resident Evil series from Capcom of Japan would also be designed to run on the Xbox 360.   In the past, Resident Evil games have run only on Nintendo and Sony consoles. Persuading Capcom to develop games for the Xbox 360 underlines the success Microsoft has had recently in attracting Japanese developers who had shied away from the American console. "

                "AFTER a 31-year-old Manhattan financial executive received Microsoft's Xbox video game system as a gift in January, he walked to a store and bought a half-dozen game titles. The video game industry would have been pleased to hear it. After he played those games a few times against computer-controlled opponents, he got a bit bored and signed up for Microsoft's Xbox Live service, which enabled him to play against other people online. The video game industry, again, would have been pleased. After a few months on the Xbox Live network, in May, he got a bit bored again. This time, however, he opened his Xbox and soldered in a chip that allowed him to change the console's basic computer code and bypass its internal security technology. After installing a new hard drive, he transferred about 3,000 MP3 music files to the system and downloaded illegal copies of 3,500 old-time arcade games. Then he installed the Linux operating system, which allowed him to use the box essentially as a personal computer. Needless to say, the video game industry would not have been pleased. When Microsoft released the Xbox in November 2001, it was heralded as far more than a game machine. Even as the Xbox took aim at Sony's PlayStation 2 game empire, the console was meant to lead Microsoft's broader invasion of the living room. Incorporating a hard drive, which made it more readily adaptable than other consoles, the Xbox had the potential to be a digital-entertainment nerve center. Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, said at the time, ''We're going to put new software that runs on Xbox that, both in the gaming dimension and other dimensions, will amaze people with the power that's in this box.'' That is happening, but not necessarily as Microsoft planned. All sorts of new software is indeed running on Xbox consoles these days, and they are in fact becoming home-entertainment hubs, but it is not Microsoft doing the amazing. Rather, an online confederacy apparently numbering in the thousands -- including accomplished hackers of varied motives and everyday technophiles like the Manhattan financial executive (who shared his experience on the condition of anonymity) -- is taking the lead. Those involved often call their efforts ''unleashing'' or ''unshackling'' -- freeing the Xbox to express its inner PC. Technology industry executives, however, often call such activity a bald attempt to hijack the Xbox illegally. It is a battle that involves many of the ethical and legal issues facing the technology and media industries at this digital moment. What rights do consumers have to tinker with products they own? How far should companies go to protect their intellectual property? What happens when the desires of consumers conflict with the business models of companies they patronize? Who gets to decide just what a particular product may be used for? The Xbox is a particularly attractive target for hackers because while it is essentially a standard PC modified to do only a few things, like play Xbox games, it is much cheaper than a PC. It is like an economy car modified to follow only a few roads -- but one potentially as powerful as a far more expensive model. In the Xbox, that power comes in the form of a 733-megahertz Intel processor, comparable to a midrange personal computer, and sophisticated graphics and audio systems. Its limited operating system, based on a version of Windows, can be used by a programmer to run simple software like a music player -- or the machine can run a new operating system altogether, namely Linux. ''The reality is that if you could bypass Microsoft's operating system you would end up with a fairly powerful computer for less than $200,'' the Manhattan financial executive said. In fact, Microsoft lowered the price for Xbox to $179.99 in May. In a sense, Xbox hackers are exploiting Microsoft's business model, which is to sell Xbox hardware at a loss (to build penetration of the system) and make the money back on royalties from the sale of Xbox software. A PC manufacturer like Dell, meanwhile, has to recoup its costs and generate a profit from the initial sale. So someone who buys the Xbox hardware, modifies it into a general-purpose computer and does not buy Xbox games potentially undermines not only Microsoft but also the personal computer industry. But that is not how some Xbox hackers think about it. ''Especially in Europe, computers are more expensive than they are here, and the Xbox is the cheapest computer you can get,'' Andrew Huang, author of a new book called ''Hacking the Xbox: An Introduction to Reverse Engineering,'' said in a telephone interview. ''Basically,'' he added by e-mail, ''once you have Linux, you have everything.'' It is unclear just how many Xbox hackers there are. Officials of the Interactive Digital Software Association, a trade group of video game publishers, said that Xbox hacking appeared more prevalent in parts of Asia than in North America. Michael Steil, a 24-year-old German who is project leader of a group that calls itself the Xbox Linux Project, said by e-mail that a full version of Linux software for the Xbox had been downloaded more than 220,000 times. Whatever the numbers, Microsoft does not appear eager to discuss Xbox hacking. In recent weeks, a Microsoft public relations representative repeatedly declined to make any company executives available to discuss the matter. Instead, the company issued a statement through a public relations firm that said in part: ''Microsoft is a company passionate about innovation and creativity. We are also very committed to respect for others' intellectual property and we request the same respect applied to our innovations.'' The statement made no reference to the potential use of hacked Xbox consoles as personal computers, saying Microsoft's ''primary concern'' was with the sale of modified chips for the boxes ''that enable game counterfeiting.'' And that is the area that most clearly raises legal issues. Although there are several methods, hacking an Xbox typically involves obtaining a special chip called a modchip, available on the Internet, and soldering it into the machine. (For those who find the process daunting, there are also vendors on the Internet who sell ''pre-modded'' Xbox units.) Modchips, of which there are several varieties, allow users to load new versions of the basic computer code, known as the BIOS, that tells the machine how to operate. A hacked BIOS generally incorporates modified versions of copyrighted Microsoft code and so is generally illegal. The main Web sites that deal with Xbox hacking do not include links to hacked BIOS, and hackers generally find their forbidden fruit in Internet chat rooms. Once the modchip is installed and the BIOS modified, the console can do a number of things it cannot do ''out of the box.'' Xbox games normally must be run from an optical disk, and a hacked Xbox can ''back up'' a game to the unit's hard drive and run the game without the disk. This technique could be used simply to avoid having to insert and remove disks -- or it could be used for piracy (say, by renting a game, putting the software on the hard drive and returning the game). Until passage of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act in 1998, the mere sale of a modified chip would not have appeared illegal. That law, however, prohibits the sale of devices that are primarily meant to circumvent copyright protection. Companies and technologists will fight over the exact legal meaning of those provisions for years. For now, however, the software industry is relying on them. ''Our view over all on modchips is that they are illegal infringing devices, that where we find people engaged in the widespread manufacturing and distribution of them, we and our members, individually and collectively, are committed to doing what we can to shut down their manufacturing and go after the distributors,'' said Doug Lowenstein, president of the Interactive Digital Software Association. Some advocates, however, say that while software piracy is illegal and morally offensive, the mere act of modifying hardware should not be illegal. ''The most important dimension of this debate from our view is that people should have the right to tinker with the stuff that they own,'' said Fred von Lohmann, senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a civil-liberties group in San Francisco. ''Others will say that this is about piracy and all that, but they forget that the principle of tinkering with the stuff that you own was the principle on which the entire personal computer industry was founded,'' he added. ''This is basic business and basic science in the technology world and we think that this right to tinker, this freedom to tinker, remains legally protected.'' For now, however, the federal government seems to agree with Mr. Lowenstein. Last December, David M. Rocci, a 22-year-old from Blacksburg, Va., pleaded guilty to a federal charge of conspiring to import, market and sell modchips for the Xbox. In April, he was sentenced to five months in prison and five months of home detention. Simply from the standpoint of accessibility, the PlayStation 2 would seem to be a more likely candidate for hacking. IDG, the technology research firm, estimates that at the end of last year, 38.1 million PlayStation 2 units were in use in Europe, North America and Japan combined, compared with 6.7 million Xbox units in those regions. In one sense, however, the hacking scene for PlayStation 2 is less developed than the one for Xbox because there is less appetite for it. Sony sells an official conversion kit for the PlayStation 2 that includes a hard drive and allows that system to run the Linux operating system, which in turn allows the system to run MP3's, movies, spreadsheets or any other program or data that works under Linux. It is relatively easy for Sony to embrace Linux because Sony, unlike Microsoft, is not in the operating system business. The PlayStation 2 hacking community seems focused on developing chips that allow PlayStation 2 units to run illegal copies of games and games meant for far-flung parts of the world. (For marketing reasons, many PlayStation 2 games include regional coding, much as DVD's do.) In 2001, Sony sued an Australian for selling modchips that allowed Australian PlayStation 2 units to play games from other parts of the world. After the Australian government argued on the man's behalf, however, the Federal Court of Australia last July ruled mostly against Sony. Mr. von Lohmann said that Microsoft had not been particularly aggressive in combating Xbox hackers but that Sony had actively fought them. A Sony spokeswoman did not respond this week to requests for comment about the company's approach to hackers. For its part, Microsoft, through its public relations agency, indicated that it believed Xbox hackers were a relatively small band. ''Aside from a set of hobbyists,'' it said, ''the vast majority of Xbox owners are not focused on this niche.'' But those who are appear quite focused indeed. By e-mail, Mr. Steil, the German leader of the Xbox Linux project, declared: ''In very simple words: The Xbox is cheaper than a PC. The Xbox is a lot smaller than a PC. The Xbox looks better (next to a TV set). The Xbox is more silent. Therefore it's an ideal Linux computer in the living room.'' That was probably not the vision Mr. Gates had in mind."

                "WHEN the dust finally settled on the 2006 holiday buying season, American consumers — who braved long lines, cold weather and possibly a few kicks to the shins — had spent $3.7 billion on new video-game consoles and software. And while the more than two million youngsters (and not-so-youngsters) who discovered a next-generation gaming system under the Christmas tree — a Microsoft Xbox 360, a Sony PlayStation 3 or a Nintendo Wii — represent a substantial user base for these platforms, they mean even more to the entertainment industry as a whole. To the makers of these video-game systems and to a growing number of film and television studios, they represent a significant new audience for full-length movies and television shows that can be downloaded directly to gaming consoles. In late November Microsoft began expanding the library on its Xbox Live network, a broadband service available by subscription to Xbox 360 owners. In addition to the video-game trailers and playable demonstrations that the network has traditionally offered, you can now find an eclectically selected collection of films and television shows offered for downloading to a console’s hard drive: for a few dollars you can view “Mission: Impossible III” or “Chinatown” or the episode of “Chappelle’s Show” with the blind white supremacist, on your television, just as if you were watching a DVD or a video-on-demand channel.  For gamers with top-shelf home-theater setups, Xbox Live also offers content in high definition: download the HD version of the “Star Trek” episode “Mirror, Mirror,” in which the Enterprise crew is accidentally beamed into a malevolent alternate reality, and you can practically count each strand of hair in evil Mr. Spock’s goatee. This month XBox Live will offer a new view of the corpulent form of Eric Cartman when it becomes the first outlet ever to offer an episode of “South Park” in high definition. While Microsoft acknowledges that most consumers are buying Xbox 360s primarily, if not solely, to play video games, the company also sees an opportunity to use film and television content to draw an audience that doesn’t fit the stereotypical gamer profile.  “The original Xbox was probably the domain of that testosterone-fueled male in the household, and while we love him to death, we also want his little brother and sister and mom and dad and their friends to be able to enjoy it,” said Peter Moore, corporate vice president of Microsoft’s interactive entertainment business division.  To that end Microsoft spent several months negotiating with Hollywood studios and television networks, including Warner Brothers, Paramount, CBS and MTV, to secure a broad variety of programming before rolling out the expanded Xbox Live service.  Although more than 4.5 million Xbox 360s have been sold, and some 60 percent of owners are connected to Xbox Live, the network’s audience will not make broadcast television or movie theaters obsolete any time soon. Yet the kind of content most abundantly available on the network — goofy comedies like “Nacho Libre” and “Zoolander,” clips of Nascar races and adventure films like “Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior” — clearly indicates whom Microsoft expects to make the most use of it: men in their 20s and 30s with enough disposable income to buy lots of video games.  “This guy is typically not going to the movies, and more often than not he’s not watching television, he’s playing games in the living room,” Mr. Moore said. “He’s a difficult person to get to in the first place.”  It is Xbox Live’s potential to deliver such a narrowly defined and increasingly difficult-to-reach demographic that makes it so enticing to the entertainment industry. “This is, to a large extent, an entirely new audience for us,” said Steve Beeks, the president of Lionsgate, an independent studio whose library includes horror movies like “The Descent” and the “Saw” franchise and which recently announced it would make its films available for download on Xbox Live. “These are active buyers of games, but we don’t believe they’ve been active buyers of movies. We’re turning them into consumers of films.”  For television networks whose programming appears on the service, Xbox Live offers the additional benefit of a precise metric to determine how many gamers are downloading their shows and how many are then seeking out these shows on broadcast television.  “We’re gauging how different clips translate into what kind of pickup in viewership we get and what kind of buzz we’re getting on the blogs,” said Dennis Quinn, Turner Broadcasting’s executive vice president for business development. “If they’re watching a six-minute clip of ‘Robot Chicken,’ is that translating into a greater sampling of the network show? If we see older shows like ‘Harvey Birdman’ picking up again, what does that mean for people who produce the content?” At least one of Microsoft’s competitors is also preparing to enter this digital arena. Sony’s PlayStation 3, which comes with the ability to play high-definition Blu-ray DVDs, also allows gamers to connect to Sony’s own broadband network. Right now that network doesn’t offer much more than video-game demos and movie trailers, but that will soon change.  “As long as you’re downloading a trailer, what’s to stop us from offering the entire program, whether it’s a movie or a TV show?” said Peter Dille, the senior vice president for marketing for Sony Computer Entertainment America. “Being part of Sony Corporation, with a film entertainment company as a sister company and a music company at arm’s length, the world is our oyster in many respects.” For the moment Nintendo has no immediate plans to make film and television programming available for its Wii game console, which also lets gamers connect to an Internet-based network of content channels. But the company did not rule out the possibility.  “There’s a lot of plans we have for the channels,” said Perrin Kaplan, Nintendo’s vice president for marketing. “And there are ways that they could be used that we haven’t yet really conceived of.” Though Microsoft is the only gaming company to provide a substantial content library (roughly 100 movies and several hundred television episodes so far), some gamers feel the offerings are too limited to encourage them to use the feature regularly.  “Until you feel like it’s a pretty comprehensive list where you can look up just about anything, it’s not a service that I think most people will use,” said Dan Hsu, editor in chief of Electronic Gaming Monthly magazine. “You can just go, ‘Well, maybe I’ll check the iTunes music store or nbc.com and see if they have the shows that I want.’ ”  Other industry executives say the current push to provide entertainment content has more to do with satisfying console manufacturers’ needs than with fulfilling gamers’ demands.  “For this round of consoles it makes total sense that they have to focus on entertainment,” said Ricardo Sanchez, an executive at GameTap, a service that lets subscribers play console and arcade games on their personal computers. “For Sony I’ve got to believe the PS3 is as much about establishing Blu-ray as it is about selling games. On the Microsoft side they’re betting so much on Xbox Live that they’ll do practically anything to drive awareness and interest in it.”  At the same time, Mr. Sanchez said, “I don’t see them spending a lot of effort, beyond just aggregating content you can get elsewhere.”  Most gamers understand that in exchange for the ability to watch “South Park” reruns on demand, they are giving the console makers something: a valuable piece of real estate in their home-theater cabinets that a DVD player or stereo receiver might otherwise occupy. That bargain is especially precious for Microsoft, which is still better known as a monolithic software company than a trusted manufacturer of home electronics.  “This is following years of Bill Gates wanting to pursue something around a set-top box,” said Josh Larson, the director of the video-game Web site GameSpot.com. “It’s kind of a Trojan horse into the living room.” But as media ploys go, Mr. Larson would rather download his movies from Xbox Live than from PC-based services like Movielink or Amazon.com’s Unbox. “Is it more likely for a gamer that you’re going to download from iTunes and hook your PC up to your TV set?” he asked. “Or a couple button-pushes and you’re watching it in a way that you’re used to watching that content? I think that’s pretty powerful.” Despite the enduring perception that his company is seeking to conquer the universe, Mr. Moore said Microsoft was looking only to provide an audience of savvy, affluent media consumers with the kind of products they want in the way they’ve grown accustomed to consuming them. “In my case,” he said, “I very rarely watch live television anymore. Shows like ‘Lost,’ I’ll wait for the DVD, thank you, rather than have to see it chopped up into five-minute increments with four minutes of commercials. In today’s world we don’t have appointment viewing anymore.” More recently, Mr. Moore said, he was looking to catch up on some recent episodes of “CSI” — in high-definition, preferably — and sure enough, the only place he could find them was on Xbox Live. “I live in Seattle,” he explained, “and I have DirecTV. They don’t put the local networks on in high-def.”"

                "WASHINGTON — In late January, as China locked down some provinces to contain the spread of the coronavirus, average internet speeds in the country slowed as people who were stuck inside went online more and clogged the networks. In Hubei Province, the epicenter of infections, mobile broadband speeds fell by more than half. In mid-February, when the virus hit Italy, Germany and Spain, internet speeds in those countries also began to deteriorate. And last week, as a wave of stay-at-home orders rolled out across the United States, the average time it took to download videos, emails and documents increased as broadband speeds declined 4.9 percent from the previous week, according to Ookla, a broadband speed testing service. Median download speeds dropped 38 percent in San Jose, Calif., and 24 percent in New York, according to Broadband Now, a consumer broadband research site. Quarantines around the world have made people more reliant on the internet to communicate, work, learn and stay entertained. But as the use of YouTube, Netflix, Zoom videoconferencing, Facebook calls and videogaming has surged to new highs, the stress on internet infrastructure is starting to show in Europe and the United States — and the traffic is probably far from its peak. “This is totally unprecedented,” said Thierry Breton, a European Union commissioner who oversees digital policy and was a chief executive of France Télécom. “We have to be proactive.” To head off problems, European regulators like Mr. Breton have pushed streaming companies such as Netflix and YouTube to reduce the size of their video files so they don’t take up as much bandwidth. In the United States, regulators have given wireless carriers access to more spectrum to bolster the capacity of their networks. Some tech companies have responded to the call to ease internet traffic. YouTube, which is owned by Google, said this week that it would reduce the quality of its videos from high to standard definition across the globe. Disney delayed the start of its Disney Plus streaming service in France by two weeks, and Microsoft’s Xbox asked gaming companies to introduce online updates and new releases only at certain times to prevent network congestion. “We really don’t know how long we’re going to be in this mode for,” Dave Temkin, Netflix’s vice president of network and systems infrastructure, said in a webinar on Wednesday on how the coronavirus could affect internet infrastructure. Internet service providers like Comcast, Vodafone, Verizon and Telefónica have been building out their networks for years to account for increasing demand. But company officials said they had never seen such a steep, sudden surge. Growth that the industry had expected to take a year is happening over days, said Enrique Blanco, the chief technology officer at Telefónica, a Spanish telecommunications company. “In just two days we grew all the traffic we had planned for 2020,” Mr. Blanco said. On Monday, traffic on AT&T’s networks was up 27 percent compared to the same day last month, and last week Verizon experienced a 22 percent increase in traffic on its wireless and fiber broadband service. Wi-Fi calls doubled from their normal volume, the carriers said. In Europe, internet traffic into homes over fixed lines was up more than 30 percent, according to Telefónica. Activities like online gaming and video conferencing have more than doubled, while messages over WhatsApp have more than quadrupled. So much traffic and stress on internet networks has slowed the speed of downloading web pages and apps, according to Ookla. “Congestion is higher,” said Adriane Blum, an Ookla spokeswoman. “We’re all at home, and the activities we’re doing in this unprecedented time are not low-bandwidth usage, which means a lot of activity on a network.” Cisco said demand for its WebEx teleconference service had tracked the spread of the coronavirus. Demand first surged in Asia, then in Europe, and last week it soared 240 percent in the United States. The demand has pushed up failure rates delivering video conferencing, said Sri Srinivasan, a Cisco senior vice president in charge of WebEx. “I don’t know if we’ll soon see a peak, not for weeks to come,” he said. “The reason I say that is because we aren’t seeing traffic in Asia slow down even now.” Internet service providers said they could handle the deluge of traffic but were adding capacity. Verizon, Cox and AT&T said they were building more cell sites to strengthen mobile networks, increasing the number of fiber connections on their network backbones, and upgrading the routing and switching technology that lets devices talk to one another and share an internet connection. Orange, formerly France Télécom, has doubled its capacity inside undersea internet cables. In Italy, where home internet use is up 90 percent, Telecom Italia said its technicians continued to make repairs and add capacity. Vodafone, one of Europe’s largest networks operators, said it had increased its capacity 50 percent in recent weeks through a mix of software and the addition of more equipment in the field. “We’re seeing some signs of stress,” AT&T’s chief executive, Randall Stephenson, said in an interview on CNN on Sunday. “We’re having to go out and do some augmentation of networks, and so we’re sending our employees out there to get that done, but right now the network is performing quite well.” To prevent clogged networks, Europe has taken the most aggressive steps. Last week, Mr. Breton, the European Union commissioner, discussed reducing the bitstreams of videos with Reed Hastings, the chief executive of Netflix; Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Google; and Susan Wojcicki, the head of YouTube. The companies agreed, as did Amazon for its Prime Video streaming service and Twitch, its online gaming platform. Many of the companies then went further. On Tuesday, Netflix decided to switch its high-definition video streams in India, Australia and Latin America to slightly lower quality to reduce the traffic they create there by 25 percent, and YouTube said it would make all global streams standard definition. “We continue to work closely with governments and network operators around the globe to do our part to minimize stress on the system during this unprecedented situation,” YouTube said in a statement. Microsoft’s Xbox gaming business recently asked large gaming companies to release online updates of their games during off-peak hours while it helped focus on the critical internet needs of people involved in the coronavirus crisis, according to an Xbox email reviewed by The New York Times. Video game updates can require great amounts of bandwidth to download. Xbox asked the companies to release updates in a four-hour overnight window in North America, and only from Monday through Thursday. “Microsoft is actively monitoring performance and usage trends to ensure we’re optimizing service for our customers worldwide, and accommodating new growth and demand,” the company said. “At the same time, these are unprecedented times, and we’re also taking proactive steps to plan for these high-usage periods.” While U.S. regulators said they did not plan to follow Europe in asking for streaming and social media companies to degrade their services, they are taking other steps. Last week, the Federal Communications Commission granted Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile temporary access to more airwaves. “The F.C.C. has been coordinating closely with network operators to ensure those networks remain up and running,” Ajit Pai, the agency’s chairman, said in a statement. Telefónica’s Mr. Blanco, who has been living under a lockdown in Spain, said he expected the record traffic to last for some time. It may even become the new normal, he said. In Spain, internet use drops only at 8 p.m., when people across the country go to their windows to cheer health workers and others who are helping to manage the crisis. “Suddenly at 8 p.m. it goes down, then it goes back up,” Mr. Blanco said. “It’s a beautiful thing.” Cecilia Kang reported from Washington, Davey Alba from New York and Adam Satariano from London. Karen Weise contributed reporting from Seattle."

                "The last time I was unemployed was in the depths of the Great Recession. I had recently moved in with my girlfriend, who suddenly found herself with an out-of-work partner who rarely left the house. But she gave me some surprising advice: Play video games. I would have a lot of time on my hands, she said, and while I could and should certainly do other things — housework, exercise, searching for a job — I would mostly be stuck at home with limited resources. Without something to occupy my mind, I’d go crazy. She was right. Playing video games helped ease my mind, elevate my mood and possibly saved our relationship. This year we’ll celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary. So now I’m going to give the same advice to anyone who is now out of work, or otherwise kept at home: Play video games. And don’t feel bad about it. If you’re not a gamer, you might think of video games as simple time-wasters. But for those stuck mostly inside without work, killing time is a real problem. And in the world of big-budget console games, 10 to 15 hours is a fairly short experience. Some can take hundreds of hours to complete. There are online games designed to be played and replayed for thousands of hours. But games are more than just empty time-wasters. In periods of pain, boredom or personal emptiness, video games can serve as palliative care for both the body and the mind. Think of gaming as a personal stimulus plan for a nation of unexpected shut-ins: It’s not a long-term solution, it won’t work for everyone, and it won’t solve the underlying problems — but it can provide limited, temporary relief for some. Video games take many forms, but they are all essentially simulations. And when the real world is temporarily unavailable, a simulated version might be what we need. Among other things, video games simulate work: Even the simplest games give players tasks, objectives, lists of things they have to do, problems to solve and a sense of accomplishment upon completion. And the biggest modern games offer seemingly endless lists of quests and objectives, tasks and subtasks, systems to learn and skills to be mastered. A game like the online shooter Destiny 2 offers hundreds, if not thousands, of hours of play, exploration and study. Set in an intricately designed sci-fi world, it tasks players with taking out wave after wave of alien enemies. It also rewards them for understanding a complex character progression system that involves completing ever-more-difficult goals and objectives, sometimes multiple times, in exchange for rarer and more powerful weapons and armor. You might not actually accomplish anything after a day spent checking off quests and gathering virtual materials, but you’ll feel like you did. Game critics have noted the worklike nature of many modern games for years, not always favorably. But in a world of stay-at-home mass unemployment, even the illusion of accomplishment is probably better than none at all. Indeed, the particular shut-in nature of our current crisis makes video games unusually relevant in a different way: What video games do better than any other medium is simulate places. Open-world games like Skyrim, Red Dead Redemption II or The Witcher 3 are built around giant, explorable spaces, sometimes the virtual equivalent of hundreds of square miles, with elaborate geography and shifting weather. They can take days or weeks to fully explore and at their best can be unexpectedly beautiful, offering the opportunity to encounter animated versions of sun-dappled vistas or foggy mountain peaks, to wander through crowded city streets or stroll past others on well-trod footpaths. Games can give us someplace else to go. That makes games useful in another way. Some of us are shut in alone. But especially in cities, many are now effectively trapped inside modest apartments with family or roommates, and little private space. Games offer a form of personal escape, a way to simulate being elsewhere from the confines of your couch. And for those who are alone, games can also serve as social spaces, virtual fields of play for cooperative adventures or competitive contests. Many of today’s most popular games are online experiences that allow players to engage with friends as well as strangers, to forge digital versions of the same sort of bonds with teammates that can develop in the real world. If you’re new at this, the cost of entry is fairly low: There are thousands of high-quality games available for phones, and many more available to download directly to your computer. Even better, many big-budget games are free if you have a computer or game console on which to play them. Late last year, Destiny 2, released in 2017 as a full-priced game, reinvented itself as a free-to-play experience, with the base game available at no cost (players can pay for expansions). Several of the “battle royale” games that have defined the new wave of first-person shooters are also free: A relatively well-reviewed recent entry, Call of Duty: Warzone, offers several clever twists on the popular last-player-standing formula. Not everyone wants to play online shooters, but for those willing to spend a little there are now subscription services that offer access to a large library of games for an annual or monthly fee. For little more than the price of a standard Netflix plan, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate offers access to dozens of games, from moody, philosophical puzzle games like The Talos Principle to richly animated platformers like Ori and the Will of the Wisps. There are sports games, strategy games, role-playing games and simple twitchy diversions that recall the arcade games I pumped quarters into as a kid. And for those who not satisfied with our current quasi-apocalypse, there even games about viral outbreaks and attacks, from the strategic epidemic simulator Plague Inc., to the deftly scripted post-pandemic action game The Last of Us, to The Division 2, a military thriller set in emptied-out recreations of downtown Washington and New York after a viral bioweapon wipes out most of the population. Maybe that one hits a little too close to home. Yes, games are frivolous. Yes, they are escapist. But the longer the coronavirus keeps social life and culture in isolation, the more we’ll need frivolity and escapism. There’s a limit, of course, to what video games can do: They can’t serve as long-term substitutes for real places, real work or real human interaction. But they can give us a simulacrum of all those things at a time when the real ones are in short supply, and tide us over until the world we actually need returns.

                "Like many young hipsters in Austin, Tex., Michael Burns wanted to make it big in some creative field -- perhaps writing comedy scripts in Hollywood. Instead, he wound up in a dead-end job, managing a call center. To kill time, he made friends with a group of equally clever and bored young men at the company where he worked, and they'd sit around talking about their shared passion: video games. Their favorite title was Halo, a best-selling Xbox game in which players control armor-clad soldiers as they wander through gorgeous coastal forests and grim military bunkers and fight an army of lizardlike aliens. Burns and his gang especially loved the \"team versus team\" mode, which is like a digital version of paint ball: instead of fighting aliens, players hook their Xboxes to the Internet, then log on together in a single game, at which point they assemble into two teams -- red-armored soldiers versus blue-armored ones. Instead of shooting aliens, they try to slaughter one another, using grenades, machine guns and death rays. On evenings and weekends, Burns and his friends would cluster around their TV's until the wee hours of the morning, gleefully blowing one another to pieces. \"Halo is like crack,\" Burns recalls thinking. \"I could play it until I die.\" Whenever a friend discovered a particularly cool stunt inside Halo -- for example, obliterating an enemy with a new type of grenade toss -- Burns would record a video of the stunt for posterity. (His friend would perform the move after Burns had run a video cord from his TV to his computer, so he could save it onto his hard drive.) Then he'd post the video on a Web site to show other gamers how the trick was done. To make the videos funnier, sometimes Burns would pull out a microphone and record a comedic voice-over, using video-editing software to make it appear as if the helmeted soldier himself were doing the talking. Then one day he realized that the videos he was making were essentially computer-animated movies, almost like miniature emulations of \"Finding Nemo\" or \"The Incredibles.\" He was using the game to function like a personal Pixar studio. He wondered: Could he use it to create an actual movie or TV series? Burns's group decided to give it a shot. They gathered around the Xbox at Burns's apartment, manipulating their soldiers like tiny virtual actors, bobbing their heads to look as if they were deep in conversation. Burns wrote sharp, sardonic scripts for them to perform. He created a comedy series called \"Red vs. Blue,\" a sort of sci-fi version of \"M*A*S*H.\" In \"Red vs. Blue,\" the soldiers rarely do any fighting; they just stand around insulting one another and musing over the absurdities of war, sounding less like patriotic warriors than like bored, clever video-store clerks. The first 10-minute episode opened with a scene set in Halo's bleakest desert canyon. Two red soldiers stood on their base, peering at two blue soldiers far off in the distance, and traded quips that sounded almost like a slacker disquisition on Iraq: Red Soldier: \"Why are we out here? Far as I can tell, it's just a box canyon in the middle of nowhere, with no way in or out. And the only reason we set up a red base here is because they have a blue base there. And the only reason they have a blue base over there is because we have a red base here.\" When they were done, they posted the episode on their Web site (surreptitiously hosted on computers at work). They figured maybe a few hundred people would see it and get a chuckle or two. Instead, \"Red vs. Blue\" became an instant runaway hit on geek blogs, and within a single day, 20,000 people stampeded to the Web site to download the file. The avalanche of traffic crashed the company server. \"My boss came into the office and was like, 'What the hell is going on?' \" Burns recalls. \"I looked over at the server, and it was going blink, blink, blink.\" Thrilled, Burns and his crew quickly cranked out another video, then another. They kept up a weekly production schedule, and after a few months, \"Red vs. Blue\" had, like some dystopian version of \"Friends,\" become a piece of appointment viewing. Nearly a million people were downloading each episode every Friday, writing mash notes to the creators and asking if they could buy a DVD of the collected episodes. Mainstream media picked up on the phenomenon. The Village Voice described it as \" 'Clerks' meets 'Star Wars,' \" and the BBC called it \"riotously funny\" and said it was \"reminiscent of the anarchic energy of 'South Park.' \" Burns realized something strange was going on. He and his crew had created a hit comedy show -- entirely inside a video game. Video games have not enjoyed good publicity lately. Hillary Clinton has been denouncing the violence in titles like Grand Theft Auto, which was yanked out of many stores last month amid news that players had unlocked sex scenes hidden inside. Yet when they're not bemoaning the virtual bloodshed, cultural pundits grudgingly admit that today's games have become impressively cinematic. It's not merely that the graphics are so good: the camera angles inside the games borrow literally from the visual language of film. When you're playing Halo and look up at the sun, you'll see a little \"lens flare,\" as if you were viewing the whole experience through the eyepiece of a 16-millimeter Arriflex. By using the game to actually make cinema, Burns and his crew flipped a switch that neatly closed a self-referential media loop: movies begat games that begat movies. And Burns and his crew aren't alone. Video-game aficionados have been creating \"machinima\" -- an ungainly term mixing \"machine\" and \"cinema\" and pronounced ma-SHEEN-i-ma -- since the late 90's. \"Red vs. Blue\" is the first to break out of the underground, and now corporations like Volvo are hiring machinima artists to make short promotional films, while MTV, Spike TV and the Independent Film Channel are running comedy shorts and music videos produced inside games. By last spring, Burns and his friends were making so much money from \"Red vs. Blue\" that they left their jobs and founded Rooster Teeth Productions. Now they produce machinima full time. It may be the most unlikely form of indie filmmaking yet -- and one of the most weirdly democratic. \"It's like 'The Blair Witch Project' all over again, except you don't even need a camera,\" says Julie Kanarowski, a product manager with Electronic Arts, the nation's largest video-game publisher. \"You don't even need actors.\" Back in college, Burns and another Rooster Teeth founder, Matt Hullum, wrote and produced a traditional live-action indie movie. It cost $9,000, required a full year to make and was seen by virtually no one. By contrast, the four Xboxes needed to make \"Red vs. Blue\" cost a mere $600. Each 10-minute episode requires a single day to perform and edit and is viewed by hordes of feverish video-game fans the planet over. More than just a cheap way to make an animated movie, machinima allows game players to comment directly on the pop culture they so devotedly consume. Much like \"fan fiction\" (homespun tales featuring popular TV characters) or \"mash-ups\" (music fans blending two songs to create a new hybrid), machinima is a fan-created art form. It's what you get when gamers stop blasting aliens for a second and start messing with the narrative. And God knows, there's plenty to mess with. These days, the worlds inside games are so huge and open-ended that gamers can roam anywhere they wish. Indeed, players often abandon the official goal of the game -- save the princess; vanquish the eldritch forces of evil -- in favor of merely using the virtual environment as a gigantic jungle gym. In one popular piece of Halo machinima, \"Warthog Jump,\" a player cunningly used the game to conduct a series of dazzling physics experiments. He placed grenades in precise locations beneath jeeps and troops, such that when the targets blew sky-high, they pinwheeled through the air in precise formations, like synchronized divers. Another gamer recorded a machinima movie that poked subversive fun at Grand Theft Auto. Instead of playing as a dangerous, cop-killing gangster, the player pretended he was a naïve Canadian tourist -- putting down his gun, dressing in tacky clothes and simply wandering around the game's downtown environment for hours, admiring the scenery. So what's it like to actually shoot a movie inside a game? In June, I visited the Rooster Teeth offices in Buda, Tex., a tiny Austin suburb, to observe Burns and his group as they produced a scene of \"Red vs. Blue.\" Burns, a tall, burly 32-year-old, sat in front of two huge flat-panel screens, preparing the editing software. Nearby were the two Rooster Teeth producers who would be acting on-screen: Geoff Ramsey, a scraggly-bearded 30-year-old whose arms are completely covered in tattoos of fish and skulls, and Gustavo Sorola, a gangly 27-year-old who sprawled in a beanbag chair and peered through his thick architect glasses at the day's e-mail. They were fan letters, Sorola told me, that pour in from teenagers who are as enthusiastic as they are incoherent. \"The way kids write these days,\" he said with a grimace. \"It's like someone threw up on the keyboard.\" In the script they were acting out that day, a pair of \"Red vs. Blue\" soldiers engaged in one of their typically pointless existential arguments, bickering over whether it's possible to kill someone with a toy replica of a real weapon. The Rooster Teeth crew recorded the voice-overs earlier in the day; now they were going to create the animation for the scene. Burns picked up a controller and booted up Halo on an Xbox. He would act as the camera: whatever his character saw would be recorded, from his point of view. Then Sorola and Ramsey logged into the game, teleporting in as an orange-suited and a red-suited soldier. Burns posed them near a massive concrete bunker and frowned as he scrutinized the view on the computer screen. \"Hmmmm,\" he muttered. \"We need something to frame you guys -- some sort of prop.\" He ran his character over to a nearby alien hovercraft, jumped in and parked it next to the actors. \"Sweet!\" he said. \"I like it!\" In a \"Red vs. Blue\" shoot, the actors all must follow one important rule: Be careful not to accidentally kill another actor. \"Sometimes you'll drop your controller and it unintentionally launches a grenade. It takes, like, 20 minutes for the blood splatters to dry up,\" Ramsey said. \"Totally ruins the scene.\" Finally, Burns was ready to go. He shouted, \"Action!\" and the voice-overs began playing over loudspeakers. Sorola and Ramsey acted in time with the dialogue. Acting, in this context, was weirdly minimalist. They mashed the controller joysticks with their thumbs, bobbing the soldiers' heads back and forth roughly in time with important words in each line. \"It's puppetry, basically,\" Ramsey said, as he jiggled his controller. Of all the \"Red vs. Blue\" crew members, Ramsey is renowned for his dexterity with an Xbox. When a scene calls for more than five actors onstage, he'll put another controller on the ground and manipulate it with his right foot, allowing him to perform as two characters simultaneously. As I watched, I was reminded of what initially cracked me up so much about \"Red vs. Blue\": the idea that faceless, anonymous soldiers in a video game have interior lives. It's a \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern\" conceit; \"Red vs. Blue\" is what the game characters talk about when we're not around to play with them. As it turns out, they're a bunch of neurotics straight out of \"Seinfeld.\" One recruit reveals that he chain-smokes inside his airtight armor; a sergeant tells a soldier his battle instructions are to \"scream like a woman.\" And, in a sardonic gloss on the game's endless carnage, none of the soldiers have the vaguest clue why they're fighting. Yet as I discovered, real-life soldiers are among the most ardent fans of \"Red vs. Blue.\" When I walked around the Rooster Teeth office, I found it was festooned with letters, plaques and an enormous American flag, gifts from grateful American troops, many of whom are currently stationed in Iraq. Isn't it a little astonishing, I asked Burns when the crew went out in the baking Texas sun for a break, that actual soldiers are so enamored of a show that portrays troops as inept cowards, leaders as cynical sociopaths and war itself as a supremely meaningless endeavor? Burns laughed, but said the appeal was nothing sinister. \" 'Red vs. Blue' is about downtime,\" he said. \"There's very little action, which is precisely the way things are in real life.\" \"He's right,\" Ramsey added. He himself spent five years in the army after high school. \"We'd just sit around digging ditches and threatening to kill each other all day long,\" he said. \"We were bored out of our minds.\" Perhaps the most unusual thing about machinima is that none of its creators are in jail. After all, they're gleefully plundering intellectual property at a time when the copyright wars have become particularly vicious. Yet video-game companies have been upbeat -- even exuberant -- about the legions of teenagers and artists pillaging their games. This is particularly bewildering in the case of \"Red vs. Blue,\" because Halo is made by Bungie, a subsidiary of Microsoft, a company no stranger to using a courtroom to defend its goods. What the heck is going on? As it turns out, people at Bungie love \"Red vs. Blue.\" \"We thought it was kind of brilliant,\" says Brian Jarrard, the Bungie staff member who manages interactions with fans. \"There are people out there who would never have heard about Halo without 'Red vs. Blue.' It's getting an audience outside the hardcore gaming crowd.\" Sure, Rooster Teeth ripped off Microsoft's intellectual property. But Microsoft got something in return: \"Red vs. Blue\" gave the game a whiff of countercultural coolness, the sort of grass-roots street cred that major corporations desperately crave but can never manufacture. After talking with Rooster Teeth, Microsoft agreed, remarkably, to let them use the game without paying any licensing fees at all. In fact, the company later hired Rooster Teeth to produce \"Red vs. Blue\" videos to play as advertisements in game stores. Microsoft has been so strangely solicitous that when it was developing the sequel to Halo last year, the designers actually inserted a special command -- a joystick button that makes a soldier lower his weapon -- designed solely to make it easier for Rooster Teeth to do dialogue. \"If you're playing the game, there's no reason to lower your weapon at all,\" Burns explained. \"They put that in literally just so we can shoot machinima.\" Other game companies have gone even further. Many now include editing software with their games, specifically to encourage fans to shoot movies. When Valve software released its hit game Half-Life 2 last year, it included \"Faceposer\" software so that machinima creators could tweak the facial expressions of characters. When the Sims 2 -- a sequel to the top-selling game of all time -- came out last year, its publisher, Electronic Arts, set up a Web site so that fans could upload their Sims 2 movies to show to the world. (About 8,000 people so far have done so.) Still, it's one thing for gamers to produce a jokey comedy or a music video. Can machinima actually produce a work of art -- something with serious emotional depth? A few people have tried. In China, a visual artist named Feng Mengbo used the first-person-shooter game Quake III to produce Q4U, in which the screen is filled with multiple versions of himself, killing one another. Players' relationships with constant, blood-splattering violence is a common subject in game art. Last year, the 31-year-old artist Brody Condon produced an unsettling film that consisted of nothing but shots of himself committing suicide inside 50 different video games. \"I try to come to terms with what taking your life means in these games,\" Condon says. \"I'm trying to understand, spiritually, your relationship with an avatar on the screen.\" But even machinima's biggest fans admit that the vast majority of machinima is pretty amateurish. \"It's like if some friends of mine all broke into a movie set, and we all got to use all the cameras and special-effects equipment,\" says Carl Goodman, director of digital media at the American Museum of the Moving Image, which began to hold an annual machinima festival two years ago. \"We wouldn't quite know how to use it, but we'd make some pretty interesting stuff.\" Yet as Goodman points out, there's a competing proposition. Machinima does not always strive to emulate \"realistic,\" artistic movies. On the contrary, it is often explicitly devoted to celebrating the aesthetics of games -- the animations and in-jokes, the precise physics. Most machinima is probably meaningless to people who don't play games, much as ESPN is opaque to anyone who doesn't watch sports. But for those who do play Halo, it was genuinely thrilling to see something like \"Warthog Jump,\" with its meticulously synchronized explosions. The Rooster Teeth crew has its own hilariously stringent rule for making machinima: no cheating. When they shoot \"Red vs. Blue,\" they do not use any special effects that are not organically included in the game; everything you see in an episode of \"Red vs. Blue\" could in theory have taken place during an actual game of Halo, played by a fan in his bedroom. It's a charmingly purist attitude, a sci-fi version of the \"Dogma\" school of indie film, which argues that movies are best when cinematic trickery is kept to a minimum. One evening in New York, I visited with Ethan Vogt as he and his machinima team shot a car-chase scene for a Volvo promo. Vogt and two producers sat at computers, logged into a multiplayer game; each producer controlled a car racing through crowded city streets, while Vogt controlled a free-floating \"camera\" that followed behind, recording the visuals. The vehicles -- an enormous 1972 Chevy Impala and a Volvo V50 -- screamed along at about 60 miles an hour, fishtailing through corners while plowing into mailboxes, lampposts and, occasionally, clots of pedestrians. The lead car burst into flames. \"That's great,\" Vogt said. \"That's great.\" Though it shares with independent filmmaking a do-it-yourself aesthetic, machinima inverts the central tradition of indie film: smallness. With their skimpy budgets, indie directors tend to set movies in kitchens or living rooms -- and focus instead on providing quality acting and scripts. Machinima, in contrast, often has horribly cheesy acting and ham-fisted, purple-prose stories -- but they're set in outer space. Want massive shootouts? Howling mob scenes? Roman gladiatorial armies clashing by night? No problem. It is the rare form of amateur film in which the directors aspire to be not Wes Anderson but George Lucas. Indeed, with video games played on computers, it is now possible to build an entire world from scratch. The core of any video game is its game engine, the software that knows how to render 3-D objects and how to realistically represent the physics of how they move, bounce or collide. But the actual objects inside the game -- the people, the cars, the guns, even the buildings -- can be altered, tweaked or replaced by modifications, or \"mods.\" Mods do not require any deep programming skills; indeed, almost any teenager with a passing acquaintance in graphic-design software can \"re-skin\" a character in a game to make it look like himself, for instance. (Xbox and PlayStation games, in comparison, are much harder to mod, because the consoles are locked boxes, designed to prevent players from tampering with the games.) I was able to see modding in action one night when I visited the ILL Clan, a pioneering machinima group. Their headquarters are the kitchen table in the cramped one-bedroom Brooklyn apartment of Frank Dellario; a lanky, hyperkinetic 42-year-old, he sat on a rickety folding chair, pecking at a keyboard. The table was littered with four computer screens and laptops, the remnants of take-out sushi and a hopelessly tangled morass of computer cords and joysticks; a huge wide-screen TV lurked behind them for viewing their work. On the night I visited, they were using a game engine called Torque to shoot a short heist movie for Audi, in which two thugs beat up a concert violinist and make off with an antique violin in a van. To quickly create a gritty-looking city, Dellario and his colleague -- ILL Clan's co-founder, Matt Dominianni -- hired a local artist to build a generic-looking urban intersection inside the game. To customize it, Dominianni went onto Google, found snapshots of a few seedy stores (an adult bookstore, a tattoo parlor and a furniture outlet) and digitally pasted them onto the front of the buildings. Then they went to a site called Turbo-Squid, a sort of Amazon for virtual in-game items, and for $45 bought a van that could be plunked down inside the game. When I arrived, they were browsing the site and contemplating buying a few women. \"My God, look at this one,\" Dellario marveled, as he clicked open a picture of an eerily realistic 3-D brunette named Masha. \"I'm going to marry this woman. They've finally broken through to total reality.\" Dellario put the van into the correct location in the scene, then logged into the game to figure out the camera angle for this shot. He frowned. It didn't look right. The lighting was all off, with shadows falling in the wrong places. Dominianni figured out the problem: \"The sun is supposed to be at high noon. It's in the wrong place.\" \"Oh, yeah,\" Dellario said. \"Let me move it.\" He pulled up a menu, clicked on the \"sun\" command, and dragged it across the sky. Now they were finally ready to shoot. Dellario realized they needed an extra pair of hands to manipulate one of the thugs. \"Want to act in this scene?\" Dellario asked, and he handed me a joystick. I sat down at one of the computers and took control of \"Thug1,\" a brown-haired man in a golf shirt and brown pants, carrying the stolen violin. Dominianni was playing \"Thug2.\" Our characters were supposed to look around to make sure the coast is clear, then jump in the truck and race off. Dellario gave me my motivation: \"It's like you hear a suspicious noise. You're nervous.\" I used the joystick to practice moving my virtual character, craning its neck -- my neck? -- back and forth. I have played plenty of video games, but this felt awfully odd. Usually when I am inside a game, I'm just worried about staying alive while the bullets whiz past my ears. I've never had to emote. While Dellario and Dominianni fiddled with the camera angle, I grew impatient and wandered around, exploring the virtual set. I peered in a few shop windows -- they were strikingly photorealistic, even up close. Then I walked down an alley and suddenly arrived at the end of the set. It was like a tiny Western town in the desert: once you got beyond the few clustered buildings, there was nothing there -- just a vast, enormous plain, utterly empty and stretching off infinitely into the distance. This spring, electronic arts decided to promote the Sims 2 by hiring Rooster Teeth to create a machinima show using the game. Called \"The Strangerhood,\" it would be freely available online. \"The Strangerhood\" is a parody of reality TV: a group of people wake up one day to discover that they are living in new houses, and they can't remember who they are or how they got there. In the Sims 2, the animated people are impressively Pixar-like and expressive, making \"The Strangerhood\" even more like a mainstream animated show than \"Red vs. Blue\"; you could almost imagine watching it on Saturday morning. The problem is, the Sims 2 has turned out to be incredibly difficult to shoot with. When the Rooster Teeth gang uses Halo for machinima, the characters are mere puppets and can be posed any way the creators want. But in the Sims 2, the little virtual characters have artificial intelligence and free will. When you're playing, you do not control all the action: the fun is in putting your Sims in interesting social situations, then standing back and watching what they'll do. When Rooster Teeth's Matt Hullum builds a virtual set and puts the \"Strangerhood\" characters in place for a shoot, he's never quite sure what will happen. To shoot a scene in which two men wake up in bed together, Hullum had to spend hours playing with the two characters -- who are nominally heterosexual -- forcing them into repeated conversations until they eventually became such good friends they were willing to share a bed. Shooting machinima with Sims is thus maddeningly like using actual, human stars: they're stubborn; they stage hissy fits and stomp off to their trailers. \"We'll do three or four takes of a scene, and one of the Sims will start getting tired and want to go to sleep,\" Hullum said. \"It's just like being on a real set. You're screaming: 'Quick, quick, get the shot! We're losing light!' \" Hullum showed me a typical \"Strangerhood\" scene. He put Nikki, a young ponytailed brunette in a baseball cap, in the kitchen to interact with Wade, a slacker who looked eerily like a digital Owen Wilson. (To give Wade a mellow, San Francisco vibe, Hullum programmed him to move at a pace 50 percent slower than the other characters.) Hullum pointed to Nikki's \"mood\" bar; it was low, which meant she was in a bad mood and wouldn't want to talk. \"When they're bored, you have to lock them in a room alone for a few hours until they start to crave conversation,\" Hullum said. He tried anyway, prodding Wade to approach her and talk about food, one of Nikki's favorite subjects. It worked. The two became engrossed in a conversation, laughing and gesticulating wildly. \"See, this footage would be great if we were shooting a scene where these guys are maybe gossiping,\" Hullum mused, as he zoomed the camera in to frame a close-up on Wade. Then Nikki started to yawn. \"Oh, damn. See -- she's getting bored. Oh, no, she's walking away,\" Hullum said, as the little virtual Nikki wandered out of the room. \"Damn. You see what we have to deal with?\" The audience for \"The Strangerhood\" has not exploded the way \"Red vs. Blue\" did. The project is a gamble: its creators hope it will break out of machinima's geeky subculture and vault into the mainstream. Though in a way, Hullum said, the mainstream isn't always a fun place to be, either. Before he returned to Austin to work on \"Red vs. Blue,\" he spent six miserable years in Hollywood working on second-rate teen movies with big budgets, like \"Scooby-Doo\" and \"The Faculty.\" \"So now to come to this, where we have total creative control of our own stuff, it's amazing,\" Hullum said, as he watched Nikki walk out of the house in search of a more interesting conversation. \"I just pray we can keep this going. Because if we can't, I'm in big trouble.\" Clive Thompson is a contributing writer for the magazine."

                "SYNTHETIC WORLDS The Business and Culture of Online Games. By Edward Castronova. 332 pp. University of Chicago Press. $29. SMARTBOMB The Quest for Art, Entertainment and Big Bucks in the Videogame Revolution. By Heather Chaplin and Aaron Ruby. 287 pp. Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill. $24.95. Here's a theory that may be neither original nor empirically defensible but feels true: The more fun an activity is, the less interesting it is to read about. War producces great journalism; water-skiing does not. Can you guess where video games fall on this spectrum? In the last few years, a great many words have been expended to report on this flourishing cultural phenomenon. Most accounts begin with a hyperactive presentation of statistics, which we will not rehearse here. This is all you need to know (and perhaps already do): Video games have grown into a huge business, outpacing the movie industry and bulldozing childhood as we knew it. We adults are not safe, either. Whether they admit it or not, you probably have friends who can be found awake at 2 a.m. disemboweling orcs, foiling terrorist plots and scooping up fumbles and running them into end zones. It is the opinion of Edward Castronova, author of \"Synthetic Worlds,\" that such electronic experiences are not merely a hedge against boredom but a profound indicator of where the entire world is heading. Online, off-line; reality, fantasy -- these distinctions will cease to matter as more and more of us pass our time in virtual environments. Economies will evolve as we pay real money for virtual goods and vice versa. Conflicts that begin online will spill into the real world and back. Laws will be written to protect our newfound interests. Castronova's vision has elements of both utopia and dystopia. But mostly he is bullish. Life in these alternative zones may eventually become so fulfilling, he contends, \"that a fairly substantial exodus may loom in the distance.\" He means this, really. Like the Irish and Italians who left their native lands in the late 19th century to come to America, gamers could create a genuine human migration, away from the real and into the virtual. What will be real then? The specific object of Castronova's scholarship is Mmorpgs, the inelegant acronym for \"massively multiplayer online role-playing games,\" which can involve hundreds of thousands of players plugging in from all over the world. A disproportionate number of these games revolve around dwarfs, wizards, quests and magic lands, though the content is becoming ever more diverse. These days, there's a Mmorpg out there to suit the interests of just about anybody. One game, The Sims Online, merely simulates suburban life, and it is madly popular. Castronova is an economist who teaches telecommunications at Indiana University, and among academic economists he is a bold contrarian, if only because he dares to take computer games seriously. My oh my does he take them seriously. In dense, lifeless prose, he sledgehammers away at his major themes, constantly pausing to review the material he's just covered and preview what is to come. His sweeping conclusions are intriguing -- get ready for governments sending agents into virtual worlds and waging war with avatars! -- but he's not a vivid enough writer to animate most of his futuristic abstractions. In \"Smartbomb,\" Heather Chaplin and Aaron Ruby try harder to entertain. They've organized their history of video games as a study of ambitious individuals, breaking it down into a series of breezy, magazinelike profiles of uneven quality. A lot of the original reporting seems to take place at gaming conventions, which is not where one imagines the really interesting stuff happens. But the stories are pretty good, even when they don't break new ground. Rereading the legend of Nolan Bushnell and the founding of Atari is like hearing a bar band play a spirited \"Twist and Shout\" -- enjoyable, but no additional points for Degree of Difficulty. In two spots, though, Chaplin and Ruby really score. In their chapter on Mmorpgs, they sensitively profile David Reber, a 30-year-old Californian who spends every free moment chained to his computer, acting out a series of intense fantasy existences that provide him with the companionship and sense of achievement missing in his real life. Just as Castronova would predict, Reber withdraws from the real world as his fantasy life deepens -- he has lapses at work and when Chaplin and Ruby last check in with him, he's moved back in with his mother. The other winning portrait in \"Smartbomb\" is of Will Wright, the creator of SimCity, as well as its offshoot The Sims, and a new simulation called Spore in which players guide a new creature from its biological origin onward. In an industry that mimics Hollywood's craven predilection for cheap, gory theatrics, Wright stands apart as a humble philosopher in love with the potential of games to expand the human experience. Though Chaplin and Ruby don't have much to say themselves about the significance of video games, they wisely hand matters over to Wright, who foresees a future that might just keep us all staying up past 2 a.m. \"I think one thing that's unique about video games is not only that they can respond to you but down the road they'll be able to adapt themselves to you. They'll learn your desires,\" he says. \"It might just be that games become deeply personal artifacts -- more like dreams.\" Video Game Books Hugo Lindgren is the editorial director of New York Magazine."

                "THE great thing about shopping for video games is that the person you're buying the gift for almost certainly knows more about it than you do. If you have gamers in your life, no matter what age, odds are that they already know exactly what they want. You need only shut up and fork over the credit card. You can use this to your advantage. If you are lucky enough that the gamer on your list has said anything recently about a game or game machine that is not Microsoft's new Xbox 360, the smart move is to drop whatever you're doing right now and buy it. That way, you will not be among the hordes this holiday season already wondering if they can afford to miss a car payment, or maybe a mortgage installment, to satisfy their 360-craving gamer. That is because the 360, with its snazzy graphics and slick online interface, has emerged as the It gift of the 2005 holiday season. Theoretically, the 360 is supposed to cost $300 for a basic unit and $400 for the deluxe version. In reality, the console is sold out across the country and is now fetching $1,000 or so on eBay. And that's before you buy any games, which run up to $60 each. So if your favorite gamer is interested in anything else this year, consider yourself fortunate. Thankfully, forgoing the 360 doesn't mean returning to the Stone Age of, say, Pong. There are still excellent games being made for the current generation of home game consoles -- Sony's PlayStation 2, Nintendo's GameCube, and the original Xbox, which each cost less than $200 -- and Sony's $250 PSP headlines the strong current crop of hand-held units. Moreover, if you have a powerful PC, that may still be your most capable game machine. In any case, both Sony and Nintendo have new game consoles on the way next year. And availability of the 360 is sure to improve in early 2006. There is a chance that Microsoft could show up with a \"surprise\" boatload of additional 360's in the next few weeks. (The word from the company is that it is working as hard as it can to get units to retailers.) Unless you're willing to pay the prices on eBay or other auction sites, the best advice to shoppers who absolutely must have a 360 is to get themselves on waiting lists at as many retailers and Web sites as possible. So those folks you saw camped out on sidewalks before the 360 went on sale on Nov. 22 don't look so silly now, right? Waiting in line for a midnight sale at a Wal-Mart in Moline, Ill., Kara Harvell told The Quad-City Times that she wanted to buy the console for her five sons. Deliciously, the newspaper reported that Ms. Harvell, a nursing school student, \"got out of class by telling her professor that her son wasn't feeling well at school.\" Of course, some people don't like waiting in line. In the (very) few days before the machine sold out, scattered reports emerged of shoppers being held up for their 360's as they left stores. Please don't go robbing anyone. But if you've already gone through the effort of finding a 360 at its regular price, it is certainly worth the extra $100 for the higher-end model. The full version comes with a headset (for making free phone calls over the Internet to other Xbox users), a wireless controller (instead of a wired model) and a hard drive, which you need to play games made for the original Xbox. Top-line games are $50 to $60. The unit comes with a free basic membership to Microsoft's online game service, which lets you talk to other online 360 users and compare scores. But if you want to actually play head-to-head live over the Internet, you need to buy the \"gold\" membership, which costs $8 a month or $50 a year. In addition to playing games with eye-popping graphics, the machine plays DVD's and can display photos from your digital camera on your regular or high-definition television. Luckily, the 360 is not the only game system potentially worth buying this holiday season. There are cheaper and more readily available options, too. Besides the Xbox 360, the other major new game machine is Sony's PSP hand-held. The sleek black unit has a clear, colorful screen that is far more vibrant than one would expect from a hand-held device, and that may be why people on buses and trains seem to be using their PSP's to watch movies as much as playing games. Dozens of movies are now being released on the small UMD data discs that slip into the back of the PSP, which inexplicably comes with white headphones reminiscent of those supplied with Apple's iPods. Over all, the games for the PSP have been lackluster so far, but that trend shows signs of changing. Aimed at adults, the new Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories takes advantage of the PSP's built-in wireless capability to allow multiple PSP users to battle one another through the game's streets and alleys, even as the players themselves are on the go. Next year, a new installment of the quirky family-friendly Japanese game Katamari Damacy is expected for the PSP. Even cheaper and smaller than the PSP is Nintendo's DS hand-held, which costs about $130. Nintendo has long been popular with young gamers, but the new Nintendogs pet simulator is finding fans among both children and adult women. The screens on the DS, which stands for dual screen, are not quite as impressive as the PSP's, but are still clear enough for enjoyable gaming. But rather than play on the go, many people still prefer their video games on the television in the den. With all of the hype around the 360 it is easy to overlook that you can now buy the original Xbox or Sony's PlayStation 2 each for around $150. Bundles that include a console and a few games can be found under $300 on the Web. Nintendo's GameCube console now costs only around $100. Of course, the Xbox, GameCube and PS2 certainly don't have the cachet of the new 360. And most serious gamers already have one, two or even all three of the older systems. But if you are looking for a cost-effective way to introduce a young person to gaming, buying any of the older systems is a smart move. In fact, many serious gamers would argue that the games being made now for those mature machines are actually better than those for the 360, which is still so new that developers have not yet figured out how to fully harness its power. The older games just don't look quite as snazzy. But until Sony's PlayStation 3 and Nintendo's Revolution are released next year, the Xbox 360 is clearly the best gaming machine around (unless you want to consider a top-notch gaming PC, which could easily cost more than $2,000). If someone you know wants a 360 and you can't find it at a reasonable price, perhaps fend them off with a PSP or a gift certificate that can be exchanged for some new games for an existing console. Then promise you'll get a 360, PlayStation 3 or Revolution next year. You may forget the promise, but they won't. Is It Live, or Is It A Video Game? THERE are about 20 games available for Microsoft's new Xbox 360. It does not have a single hit title yet, as Halo became for the original Xbox, and the lineup is still missing some genres, like role-playing games. Nonetheless, games out now do a good job of demonstrating how the next generation of consoles deliver visual and social experiences far more sophisticated than those possible on older consoles. The strongest two genres on the 360 are auto racing and first-person shooters. On the racetrack, Project Gotham Racing 3 lets you speed through detailed recreated cities like New York, Las Vegas and London. You can race in online leagues, compete against \"ghosts\" that simulate your friends' best performances or \"tune in\" and watch from the sidelines as some of the best virtual drivers in the world go wheel to wheel. The shooters put a player in the perspective of a person fighting, often with guns. Among the standouts are Perfect Dark Zero, set in the near future, and Call of Duty 2, a gritty re-creation of World War II. The most visually impressive 360 game is Kameo: Elements of Power, an action adventure that looks like child's play, with its evocation of a Pixar animated film, but is challenging at points. About half the games for the 360 mimic real-life sports. NBA 2K6, which at times could pass for a live telecast, is the most impressive of the bunch. Amped 3, a snowboarding simulator, is easy to play and gorgeous to watch. SETH SCHIESEL"

                "Tomorrow the Xbox, the new video-game console from Microsoft, arrives in stores on the heels of a $500 million marketing blitz. But it doesn't seem as if much of that money is going to the thousands of musicians who have provided the company with songs to use in the games that will be played on it. Though a band can typically make $10,000 to $20,000 when a song is included in a video game, Microsoft has been asking musicians to contribute their music to video games for pennies -- and in some cases no money at all, with no upfront fee and no royalties on the back end. Musicians, from small, independent punk bands to major-label artists, have been accepting this deal, hoping for the promotional boost that comes with being heard in a game that is played obsessively by teenagers across the country. Joining a band is not a lucrative career choice for most musicians. Many who are signed to major labels spend their careers in debt to those record companies, trying to earn back advances and expenses. But the increasing use of contemporary songs in movies, video games and advertisements has meant an unexpected windfall for lesser-known and midlevel artists. Microsoft, however, is changing that dynamic. ''I asked if we could get any money, and they just said no,'' said Larry Cooper, who runs Revelation Records, a punk, metal and hardcore label that has several songs on the soundtrack to Amped, a snowboarding game. ''I almost thought that out of principle, if there's no payment, we shouldn't do that kind of stuff. But I didn't want to snip out an opportunity for a band that might want to do that kind of promotion.'' Of the bands Mr. Cooper asked, all but one agreed to provide free music to Microsoft. ''I think they were just looking for cheap music, and that's why they called a lot of small labels,'' Mr. Cooper continued. ''I asked them who else was on the soundtrack and made some suggestions, but they said they wanted to stick with certain labels because they didn't have to pay for licensing.'' Brenner Adams, a product planner on Amped, said that on his game Microsoft was looking not for cheap music but for an opportunity to expose as many small underground bands as possible. Under Microsoft policy the interview with Mr. Adams was conducted with a company publicist on the line, taking notes on the conversation. ''We're not saying, 'Hey, we want to use your music for nothing,' '' Mr. Adams said. ''We said, 'Hey, we really want to promote these artists and promote who they are and what they stand for.' '' Though Microsoft didn't give any money to musicians on such independent labels, it did offer small amounts to bands on major labels. It made a deal with Virgin Records, obtaining songs from acts like the Gorillaz, Iggy Pop, the Chemical Brothers and Timbaland & Magoo by paying ''small fees and publishing,'' said Brad Fox, the director of artist development at Virgin. The amount of course remains a big contrast to the millions of dollars that Microsoft is believed to have paid to use Madonna's ''Ray of Light'' in its 60-second Windows XP advertisement. ''We're looking at this as a marketing exercise,'' Mr. Fox said. ''There's no way I could get 10 to 15 different artists in somebody's house in front of an active consumer audience for 20 hours a week. If I could get 20 percent of those kids to go buy a record, that's great.'' But the Xbox isn't like other systems, nor are these deals like other deals. Many record labels are operating on the faith that Microsoft will make efforts to promote their bands. Mr. Fox said he hoped that the Virgin artists used in the games would be mentioned in Xbox promotional material, game catalogs and game boxes. But a trip to the Xbox Web site showed that the artists on games like Amped were not mentioned on the box or promotional poster shown online, nor were the bands on any game highlighted in any special way on the Web site. Other promotional efforts, however, have been made: there was a link at the site to a radio station playing music from Amped, and at a recent Xbox promotional party in Los Angeles Microsoft gave away a CD with music from Amped. Mr. Adams noted that most of the cash deals were made with better-known bands that don't need the publicity as much. ''So,'' he said, ''why not turn the decision around, bring the smaller guys up and give them the promotion they can't get anywhere else?'' He said that music from some 240 artists was used on Amped, that in the game the names of the record labels are shown on banners and that players had the option of seeing names of the bands, songs and record labels. He added that the company hoped to stage more promotions with the music. But there is no guarantee that gamers will hear much if any of the music of these bands. That is because in a feature unique to the Xbox consumers have the option of wiping out the soundtrack to a game and replacing it with music from their own CD's. Originally music executives were less worried about artists not getting paid than about the potential for Xbox to become a new Napster, since it has a large hard drive and online capabilities. But in a statement prepared for this article Microsoft said that though music could be stored on the hard drive, it could not be copied on ''CD's, MP3's or any other devices.'' Other executives in the music publishing business now worry that video game manufacturers and even advertising agencies will follow Microsoft's lead and tell bands that in exchange for use of their music at no cost, an extra effort will be made to promote the groups in products and commercials. As it is, artists sacrifice a lot of money and time at the altar of promotion, taking on costly and inconvenient tasks gratis, like performing concerts promoted by radio stations. So, some wonder, in a field in which just about anything musicians do can be seen as raising their profiles, where is the line between promotional and paid work? Jeff Koz, the chief executive of SubZero, a company that brokers deals between advertisers and musicians, said, ''We believe that people should be paid for what they do.'' Mr. Koz has worked with Microsoft on music and sound design. He added, however, that there was a give-and-take between payment and promotion, and lesser-known artists were often given somewhat lower fees in exchange for what could be career-enhancing exposure. ''There's value to cross-promotion,'' he said, ''and we're not privy to how those Microsoft deals went down. Some of those bands might see it as a tremendous opportunity.'' No. 1 and Dropping The new Britney Spears album, ''Britney,'' will enter the pop charts next week at No. 1 with 769,000 copies sold, according to Soundscan, a company that tracks retail sales. The number, a significant drop from the first-week sales of her previous album (1.3 million), reflects a teenage pop demand that is slipping but still hanging on tenaciously as Ms. Spears sagely remakes her image so she has one foot in the teenage world and the other in the general pop market (an approach best summed up by her song title ''I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman''). The following week, record executives say, ''Britney'' seems likely to slip to No. 2 when the Garth Brooks album ''Scarecrow'' makes its debut with predicted sales of more than one million copies."

                "LOS ANGELES — Microsoft, seeking to expand offerings on its Xbox 360 console, has reached an agreement with a company headed by Peter Safran, the veteran Hollywood producer and talent manager, to produce original shows for distribution on the system. Through his Safran Co., he represents clients like the actor and producer Sean Combs (\"Monster's Ball\"), the actor and writer Nia Vardalos (\"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\") and the filmmakers Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer (\"Epic Movie\"). Safran founded the company in 2006 after leaving Brillstein-Grey Management. Speaking by telephone last week, Scott Nocas, global marketing manager for programming of the Xbox Live entertainment service, said he expected similar deals to follow. \"We definitely look at this as the first of many,\" said Nocas. In an interview at his office in Los Angeles last week, Safran said his first round of programs would be scripted and would probably run under 10 minutes. He said his initial focus would be on genres like comedy and horror that appeal to the Xbox 360 audience, which is heavily concentrated from the ages of 14 to 34, and tends to be more male than female. The first shows are expected to be available to viewers by autumn in the Northern Hemisphere. \"The Xbox is unique; it operates at a level outside of what we generally consider Web entertainment,\" Safran said, referring to the system's tight demographic base, which is defined by the appeal of signature games like the Halo series. The new shows will be available exclusively via the Xbox 360 for a time, then may appear elsewhere, Safran said."

                "Looking for an advantage in the next round of the video-console wars, Microsoft has made the first move. Three and a half years after it entered the console market with the Xbox, Microsoft yesterday unveiled its successor, the Xbox 360, a creamy white console that is to go on sale in North America, Europe and Japan by the holiday season. Though noticeably smaller than its squat black predecessor, the console houses three 3.2-gigahertz I.B.M. microprocessors that could qualify it as the most powerful home computer on the market. Indeed, unlike the original Xbox, the new console can act as a home entertainment hub, streaming pictures, music and video from digital cameras, portable music players and computers that run Microsoft Windows XP. Most evidently different, Xbox 360, which Microsoft introduced last night in a 30-minute presentation on MTV, is designed to display games in wide-screen, high-definition format as well as in standard definition. Microsoft's move, after years of secrecy, rumors and fragmentary disclosures, comes as its competitors -- Sony, the undisputed industry leader, and Nintendo, a close third worldwide -- are also preparing presentations of their coming consoles for the Electronic Entertainment Expo, a major industry trade show, in Los Angeles next week. Representatives of those companies said their game systems, Sony's PlayStation 3 and Nintendo's, which is code-named Revolution, are set for release next year. For the game industry, with $10 billion a year in sales in the United States alone, the consoles' arrivals will not only give rise to new demand for game hardware but will set off a new wave of game development and purchases. As the consoles put new emphasis on high-definition video, they may stimulate TV sales as well. One analyst, describing the anticipation surrounding the announcements, said it was as if Detroit released a new line of automobiles only once every four or five years. \"The business is getting bigger, the stakes are getting higher, and there is such a big leap in technology, potentially making the games ever more realistic and involving,\" said Anita Frazier, entertainment industry analyst for NPD Funworld. Microsoft did not disclose the pricing of its new console. Since their introductions, the current Xbox and Sony's PlayStation 2 have dropped in price from $300 to $150 in the United States; Nintendo's GameCube, originally $200, is now $100. When Xbox arrived in 2001, it was heralded as the most powerful of the consoles and had innovations including a built-in hard drive and an Ethernet port for online play. The machine's biggest hits have been the Halo games, published by Microsoft itself; Halo 2, released last fall, has sold 6.3 million copies. Xbox has also developed a following among game developers, who have been drawn to its power. Still, even with 20 million consoles sold, Xbox has been far outdistanced by Sony's PlayStation 2, with sales of 80 million and 70 percent of the world market. While Halo 2's success put Microsoft's games unit in the black for one quarter last year, the Xbox effort has yet to provide sustained profitability. \"Xbox 1 was very much ready, fire, aim,\" said J Allard, corporate vice president at Microsoft and a leading architect of the Xbox effort. \"We had 19 months and a day between the day we approved the project to the day we were on store shelves.\" For the new Xbox project, Mr. Allard said his team had twice that time and aimed at conceiving a \"magical product\" that was so well integrated it would seem the creation of a single mind. In sheer computing power, the new Xbox is capable of a trillion calculations per second, many orders of magnitude above the original Xbox. (The current box depends mainly on a 733-megahertz processor.) The heat generated by all that power will be drawn off by a water-based cooling system, something usually seen only in high-end PC's. It will also include a redesigned wireless game controller. A Web camera, code-named Cyclops, and a TV-like remote control will be optional. Peter Moore, a Microsoft corporate vice president for worldwide sales and marketing, said Xbox 360 would be especially suited for wide-screen high-definition television and Digital Dolby 5.1 multichannel sound, a requirement for all Xbox 360 games. He added that the new console would also be more seamlessly integrated with Xbox Live, the service that connects games and gamers over high-speed Internet connections for multiplayer action. Xbox Live, which has 1.4 million subscribers, will include a new tier that waives the $6 monthly fee. A demonstration of the console's power delivered stunningly realistic scenes that were indistinguishable at some points from live-action video. \"We have to continue to feed that core audience,\" Robert J. Bach, senior vice president and chief Xbox officer at Microsoft, said of the most ardent gamers. \"But part of the challenge of this next generation is how do we cultivate a broader mass audience.\" Part of that strategy, he said, includes designing Xbox 360 to perform a range of nongaming functions suited to the living room, like streaming digital music and pictures, or videoconferencing. In addition to playing DVD's, as the current Xbox does, it can rip songs from CD's onto a 20-gigabyte hard drive -- a hard drive that can be removed, upgraded and interchanged with other 360 consoles. Judging by dozens of Web sites dedicated to interest in next-generation consoles, expectations are soaring that Xbox 360's competitors will also provide vastly improved graphics, sound and game playing. For example, it is widely believed that Sony's PlayStation 3, which will use a new cell processor technology, will be the most powerful. Molly Smith, a Sony spokeswoman, would not discuss hardware specifics of the PlayStation 3. But she did say that it would be able to deliver \"a quantum leap\" in gaming and electronic entertainment. Nintendo, struggling to shed an image that its technologies mostly appeal to children, is preparing to deliver a game console that is radically different from the cute and cuddly GameCube. Perrin Kaplan, Nintendo's vice president for corporate affairs, said GameCube's successor would be \"very, very sleek.\" She described it as horizontal and no taller than a stack of three DVD cases. Unlike GameCube, the new system will play DVD's, Ms. Kaplin said, and will feature a wireless controller. It will play GameCube games as well as a new class of high-definition games, with new emphasis on online play. Microsoft would not say whether games for the current Xbox would play on Xbox 360. Some industry analysts and game developers said it was likely that games for all three consoles would increase to $60 or $65; the typical price for premium titles on the current machines is $50. \"Over all, the introduction of the next-generation systems will have a very positive impact on the video game industry,\" said Will Kassoy, vice president for global brand management at Activision, a game publisher. \"They will expand the user base and grow software sales.\" Historically, he said, each new cycle of consoles has ushered in a 30 percent rise in the number of players. \"We believe this next generation will see similar growth,\" Mr. Kassoy said. Activision is scheduled to have four games for Xbox 360 at the start, including some of the company's best-selling series -- Tony Hawk, Call to Duty and Quake. Simon Jeffery, president of Sega, said his company would have two titles for Xbox 360 for the holiday season -- Condemned: Criminal Origins and Full Auto -- emphasizing that they will take advantage of the new console's increased power. \"Every successive jump in technology affords new elements of games,\" he said. \"We now will have processing power to do things we haven't been able to do before.\""

                "Sending voice and Webcam picture messages to fellow Xbox 360 players over Microsoft’s Xbox Live service is a cinch, but tapping out old-fashioned text messages using the 360’s onscreen keyboard isn’t much fun. A new $30 miniature keyboard called the Chatpad speeds up text entry to let you best even the fastest BlackBerry touch-typists.  The Chatpad, to go on sale Sept. 6, attaches to the underside of the 360’s controller without interfering with the controller’s comfortable feel in the hands. A backlight makes typing during late-night Gears of War campaigns easier on the eyes, and a dedicated Messenger button activates the 360’s instant messaging program so you can taunt your enemies without breaking from the action. Unfortunately you can’t use the keyboard to type a letter and jump to the corresponding spot in long lists of Xbox Live movie downloads or songs stored on an iPod connected to the 360. Instead, you need to hold down the scroll button. Albert Penello, director for global marketing for Xbox, said the company was looking into a way to add this feature. "

                "FORGET horsepower, forget miles per gallon: the key metric for judging the Nissan Urge, a design study to be introduced today at the North American International Automobile Show in Detroit, is polygons per second, an index of performance for video games. Five hundred million polygons a second is the rating for the Microsoft Xbox 360 video game system tucked away in the car's trunk. It pumps out images fast enough to generate dizzyingly sharp scenes of city streets and speeding cars on a display that folds down from above the windshield. The Urge's key trick is that when parked, its steering wheel and pedals can be used to control the Xbox. The game's soundtrack of roaring engines and screeching tires play through the car's speakers to accompany the action on the screen. Many cars have had video game displays installed in their dashboards. The Urge is the first car to be turned into a game controller -- the tail is now wagging the dog. The Urge, created at Nissan Design America in the La Jolla section of San Diego, is another of the auto industry's seemingly endless quests for \"echo boomer\" customers, a coterie that for carmakers gleams over the horizon the way the mythical city of Eldorado did for the conquistadors. In part, the Urge is a response to an online survey, said John Cupit, a design manager for Nissan. Mr. Cupit interpreted the survey results in the bare, exposed look of the Urge, an articulation of the car's parts aimed, he said, at giving the feel of a motorcycle. The fenders and structure, mostly aluminum, stand out as separate parts. The engine -- a piece of the car so unimportant in this case that Nissan did not even provide the usual specifications of horsepower and torque -- is visible beneath a transparent hood. Nissan calls the look \"minimalism to the maximum.\" The bottoms of the doors are cut away, revealing a surrounding frame of aluminum rendered in \"acid yellow,\" which Anka Mazzei, the color designer, said she chose to express intensity and speed. The front end of the Urge is similar to the GT-R Proto, a concept that Nissan unveiled at the Tokyo auto show last fall. But one should not take the exterior of the Urge too literally. Its weirdness signals that it is unlikely to become a production vehicle. What counts is the concept. Urge is an implicit response to cultural change: young buyers have proved more fascinated by the innovations of their new cellphones, hand-held devices and video games than by the automotive advances that captivated their parents. The showcase game for the Xbox 360 is a special edition of Project Gotham Racing, one of the hit titles for the original Xbox as well. Mr. Cupit said that he and his colleagues at the La Jolla studio spend a lot of time playing on a huge plasma screen. The project was a joint effort with Microsoft, so the Xbox 360 beneath the boattail- shape trunk, one of a half-million consoles shipped since the game system went on sale Nov. 22, is different from the others: no one stood in line to buy it. Video gaming is not the only technology incorporated into the Urge. In addition to the Xbox 360, there is an iPod docking station and a cellphone that doubles as a \"smart key\" to start the engine. In at least one respect, the Urge might be the perfect car: it burns no gasoline while parked for game playing; it generates no emissions; it lines up in no traffic jams. It can virtually roll through the streets of Las Vegas or spin around the Nürburgring. Its version of Gotham Racing can even run uptown on the parts of Broadway that are one-way heading downtown, a special thrill for Manhattan drivers. With a wireless connection, in theory, two Urges could be parked side-by-side for competition like the old racing games at the arcade in Atlantic City. Thanks to the Internet, the same thing could be done even if the Urges were half a world apart. The game encourages stylish driving. Good driving through the curves earns the driver style points, called Kudos, that can be redeemed for a better vehicle. According to the Microsoft programmers, power sliding, pulling off a 360-degree spin, getting air time, drafting and getting up on two wheels \"will earn gamers Kudos points for their style and skill.\" Too bad the real automotive world doesn't work this way. Each car in the game is made up of 80,000 polygons and takes eight days of programming by its creators, who are holed up in the London studio of Bizarre Creations. Real-world details include gauges that move and realistic bug-smash streaks on the windshield. Oddly, the Urge itself is not among the cars you can drive on the screen. That will probably be remedied soon. Project Gotham players and programmers regularly produce new cars that can be downloaded. The Urge's notion of car-as-video game is not unprecedented. A similar concept, the Scion Speedster -- a red Scion xA show car built by 5 Axis Productions in Huntington Beach, Calif. -- was displayed at the Specialty Equipment Market Association trade show in Las Vegas last fall. The Speedster also has an open panel in the doors -- and two Xboxes running the Forza racing game onboard. The two cars simply evolved at the same time, Mr. Cupit said. He prefers his version of the idea. \"We tried to take seriously designing the door glass to protect the occupants from wind and rain, and also vehicle ingress-egress,\" he said. \"Our door moves up and down to ease entry into the car, for example.\" \"We often visit tuner and customizing shows to see what young people are thinking about,\" Mr. Cupit said. \"The Urge helps reinvent the sports car for the next generation of young people.\" Observing young people at auto shows, it is impossible not to note that they pay more attention to how their cars look and sound than how fast they go. The investment tends to go into electronics and colorful bolt-on parts, rather than into making the engine run faster and more furious. Maybe more automakers should put Xboxes in their cars. General Motors and Ford might stir up interest by tucking Xbox 360's into all their trunks."

                "REDMOND, Wash. — Microsoft is betting it has a new way to win the wallets of consumers. The company on Tuesday introduced the new version of its Xbox video game console. The Xbox has been one of Microsoft’s few undeniable consumer hits of the last decade, a product that was not just a credible entry into the games business but also a sign of the innovation possible at a company that is rarely seen as an inventive thinker. “I think of Xbox as the accidental success out of Microsoft,” said James McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester Research, who added that the connection Microsoft has formed with the players of its current Xbox is “much deeper than any relationship Microsoft has ever achieved before.”  The new console, the Xbox One, will enter a market very different from the one its predecessor, the Xbox 360, entered nearly eight years ago, when there was no iPad, smartphones had keyboards and mobile gaming devices were primitive at best.  Today, video games can be played almost anywhere, on any device, with the biggest possible audience of online friends and without the aid of a costly gaming console. The last year or two has been bumpy for Microsoft’s consumer efforts. The Windows 8 operating system software and the Surface tablet-computing devices got a tepid reception from the public when they went on sale last fall.  The company’s mobile phone efforts have been largely ignored. And even Bing, Microsoft’s Internet search engine, has failed to close a wide gap with Google, the market leader.  Microsoft, though, could see better results with the Xbox. With it, it hopes it can reassert the living room as the place where people can still get the best gaming experience, complete with eye-popping graphics and innovative methods for controlling games. It is also a place where Microsoft’s technology can be at the center of a home entertainment system and the funnel through which people gain access to online video. Microsoft has sold more than 76 million of the device’s current incarnation, the Xbox 360 worldwide, compared with almost 100 million Wii consoles from Nintendo and more than 70 million PlayStation 3s from Sony.  The company also controls what may be the most valuable asset in console gaming, Xbox Live, a subscription-based online service with 48 million members who use it to play games against one another and watch movies.  “You can do a lot of things on the phone and a lot of things on tablets,” said John Taylor, an analyst at Arcadia Investment. But, he said, “you can’t do the same kinds of things on those devices” that you can on a television screen. Microsoft plans to develop its own original, live-action television series, which will be accessible through the Xbox. The series will be made in partnership with the director Steven Spielberg and will be based on the popular Halo video game franchise.  The company is also working with the National Football League to develop an app for Xbox that lets players interact with their fantasy football teams while watching a live game. In an interview, Don A. Mattrick, the president of Microsoft’s interactive entertainment business, said that he recognized the growing appeal of mobile devices for gaming and that Microsoft would aggressively tie smartphones and tablets into the experience of using its console. He became most animated when talking about the possibilities of the new Xbox for providers of video programming. “We’re going to the take the form from a one-way experience pushed through a straw to where you can communicate back and make it interactive,” Mr. Mattrick said.  Even if it is a wild success, the new Xbox is likely to have a bigger impact on consumer perception than it will on Microsoft’s overall sales. The Xbox remains a small slice of the company’s business, which is still dominated by sales of Windows, Office and other software. The company’s games division represented only 4 percent of its operating profit. At an event in a carnival tent on its corporate campus, Microsoft did not say how much the new system would cost or how publishing partners would charge for games, which typically start at around $60 for high-end game consoles.  A major feature of the new Xbox, which is expected to hit store shelves in time for the holiday season, will be a new generation of Kinect, the camera-based motion-control sensor introduced several years ago as an Xbox 360 accessory. The new Kinect will come with every Xbox One. Traditional retail sales of games have come under pressure in recent years as mobile devices like the iPhone and iPad have invaded their turf with free and low-cost games. While many gamers dismiss those offerings as inferior to console games, the games have nevertheless tapped into a huge audience of players who may never have played on an Xbox or Sony’s PlayStation. The games business could use a jolt. Total United States retail sales of game hardware and software fell 25 percent to $495.2 million in April from $657.5 million a year earlier, according to estimates by NPD Group, a research firm. That figure does not include the sale of downloadable content over the Internet. Alex St. John, an entrepreneur who worked on Microsoft’s pre-Xbox game efforts, says he is pessimistic about prospects for gaming consoles. “They’re coming out with the latest and greatest stone tool,” Mr. St. John said. “The new console that trumps the old console is called the Apple iPad. This generation of kids loves mobile games.”"

                "Three months after surprising the video game industry with strong sales of its first console, the Microsoft Corporation will dispatch its chairman, Bill Gates, to Tokyo this week to introduce its assault on an inhospitable Japanese market. Not since the industry's early days, when Atari competed for space in video arcades, has a major American game company tried to dethrone Japanese hardware makers on their own turf. When it begins selling its Xbox game system in Japan on Friday, Microsoft will try to use the star power of Mr. Gates and a lineup of specialized games to battle the leaders, Sony and Nintendo. Many industry insiders predict that the Xbox, which has sold more than 1.5 million units in North America since November, will face tough going in Japan, where American software companies have found tremendous difficulties merely putting their games onto store shelves. ''You are talking about a closed market and going up against two very strong, very entrenched competitors,'' said Heath A. Terry, a game software analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston. ''For Microsoft to expect significant success early on in that market is unrealistic.'' The Xbox has other strikes against it for Japanese consumers, who buy about a third of the world's game products. Analysts worry that the console is too big for the living room in a country where smaller gadgets rule. And at about $260, the Xbox costs $40 more than Sony's PlayStation2 and $75 more than Nintendo's GameCube. Yet analysts and software makers acknowledge that Microsoft, the world's No. 1 software company, managed the North American rollout of the Xbox better than they had expected. They also noted that it has deep pockets and has shown unflagging persistence in entering other businesses. The company has already made one significant adjustment specifically for Japan: after criticism from early testers, it built smaller game controllers, with buttons closer together, to better fit the hands of the average Japanese player. Peter Moore, president and chief operating officer for Sega of America, the American division of the Japanese games publisher, said Microsoft's early success in North America gave the company a fighting chance in Japan and Europe, where the Xbox goes on sale on March 14. ''It's eerily reminiscent of the power of the launch of the PlayStation,'' he said, referring to Sony's first console. ''The way a powerful global company can attack an industry, get under its skin and change an industry.'' Hirohisa Ohura, who runs Microsoft's Xbox division in Japan, said the North American introduction had proved that the company could compete in the video game business. While calling Japan ''the most challenging market'' for the Xbox, he said Microsoft would keep chipping away at its competitors for the loyalty of Japanese game players. ''U.S. companies coming into Japan as a game vendor tended to fail and walk away real quick,'' Mr. Ohura said. ''We're not willing to give up at any point. Once we're in this business, we're in here to win.'' In its quest for the buzz that makes or breaks video games, Microsoft set up hundreds of Xbox kiosks in Tokyo and Osaka earlier this month. And for the introduction on Friday, Mr. Gates himself will stump for the Xbox at an event similar to his appearance last November at the opening of the Toys ''R'' Us store in Times Square. Microsoft began taking advance orders on Feb. 2 for consoles, including 50,000 special edition systems with a translucent case and a silver-plated key chain engraved with the autograph of Mr. Gates -- an accessory that has been mocked on online message boards and game publications. Sony, the consumer electronics giant, has an enormous head start on Microsoft. By Dec. 31, Sony said, it had shipped 25 million of its next-generation consoles, the PlayStation2, including 10 million to North America and 8 million to Japan. ''The burden isn't on our company to compete with them; the burden is significantly on Microsoft to compete with us,'' said Molly Smith, a spokeswoman for Sony Computer Entertainment America, the company's American division. The list of best-selling software is dominated by titles that run on the PlayStation2. Yet while they have capitalized on Sony's success in North America, large American game publishers have found the Japanese market difficult to penetrate and have been forced to cooperate with Japanese publishers to develop games specifically for Japan and have games sold there. Electronic Arts is the No. 1 publisher of PlayStation2 titles in North America, but only No. 7 in Japan. ''The secret in Japan is getting product that's culturally appealing to Japanese consumers,'' said Stan McKee, chief financial officer of Electronic Arts. Microsoft has forged partnerships of its own with more than 90 Japanese publishers, but still faces an uphill battle. Because of Sony's lead, analysts said, Microsoft will consider its introduction a success if it wins close to 20 percent of the Japanese market."

                "Reaching out to millions of aspiring game developers around the world, Microsoft plans today to announce a contest that will award $10,000 and the opportunity to entice millions of eyeballs to the next great digital diversion for the company’s Xbox 360. In addition to the game console’s snazzy graphics, the Xbox Live online service has been the most important component of the Xbox 360’s success since its debut in 2005. And perhaps the most popular aspect of Xbox Live has been the service’s arcade component, which allows users to download and play smaller, relatively simpler games like Uno and Geometry Wars that usually cost less than $10. (By contrast, top-end games can sell in stores for around $60.) The popularity of Xbox Live Arcade has in turn attracted the attention of game developers looking to create the next Tetris or Minesweeper. Late last year, Microsoft introduced a suite of software tools for making so-called casual games called XNA.  And so at a game makers’ convention in San Francisco, Microsoft plans to announce a contest akin to the television show “Project Greenlight” that will award a cash prize and a potential slot on Xbox Live Arcade to the best new game created with XNA tools. The company intends to announce the winner of the contest, called “Dream-Build-Play,” in August.  “This competition highlights the power of XNA and the popularity of the Xbox Live Arcade service with its millions of users,” Aaron Greenberg, Microsoft’s group product manager for the Xbox 360 and Xbox Live, said in a telephone interview.  To help increase the popularity of casual games, Microsoft will also announce the introduction of a new 512-megabyte portable storage device for the Xbox 360. The previous portable storage unit contained only 64 megabytes of data, and so Xbox Live Arcade games had been limited to an official size of 50 megabytes. With the new unit, Microsoft will also raise the official size limit on Xbox Live Arcade games to 150 megabytes, allowing enhanced graphics, sound and artificial intelligence. SETH SCHIESEL"

                "Raising the ante in the video game wars, Microsoft is bringing out a new version of the Xbox 360 game machine that has a bigger hard drive, better high-definition video support and a stylish black finish, not an insignificant feature in a world where looking cool ranks high. The idea is to appeal to an elite class of hardcore game players who would like a little more of everything.   “Today’s games-and-entertainment enthusiast has an insatiable appetite for digital high-definition content,” said Peter Moore, corporate vice president for Microsoft’s interactive entertainment business, in Redmond, Wash.   The Xbox 360 Elite, which is to be announced today and will be in stores in late April, will have a list price of $479, or $80 more than the Xbox 360 Pro and $180 more than the basic Xbox 360. The new model has a 120-gigabyte hard drive, in contrast to the standard model’s 20-gigabyte drive. It also has a high-definition multimedia interface port and cable and a wireless controller and headset. Current Xbox 360 owners can buy the new 120-gigabyte hard drive as a separate accessory for $179.  Microsoft is clearly hoping to fill what it sees as a hole at the top end of the market. The Nintendo Wii has been outselling the PlayStation 3 from Sony and the Xbox 360 in recent months, but that system is largely positioned as a family-friendly game machine that can be purchased for $50 less than the lowest-priced Xbox. The Sony system is priced higher than both the Nintendo and the Microsoft systems, with the cheapest model priced at $499.  Both Microsoft and Sony have positioned their consoles as entertainment hubs, not just for playing sophisticated video games but also for listening to music and viewing downloaded movies and television shows.   John Rodman, group product manager for the Xbox platform and Xbox Live, pointed to a recent Microsoft survey that revealed that nearly 40 percent of the time that Xbox 360 users spent with their consoles was for activities other than gaming.   Yet when it comes to gaming, Xbox 360 users are serious, Mr. Rodman says. Six out of 10 Xbox 360 users use Xbox Live, Microsoft’s online gaming service.   “We don’t feel like the Wii customer and the Xbox customer are the same thing,” he said. “We think that as soon as the Wii customer turns 14 they want something else.”  James L. McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester Research, said that Microsoft hoped to encourage customers to spend more money downloading movies and games, which require considerable hard-drive space. "

                "LOS ANGELES  Reaching out beyond hardcore video game players to everyday consumers, Microsoft outlined an entertainment strategy on Monday for making the company’s Xbox 360 game console a gateway for movies, television and social networking. In a media presentation on the eve of E3, the video game industry’s biggest North American convention, Microsoft announced new relationships with the social networking giants Facebook and Twitter as well as Sky, the big British satellite television provider that is a unit of the News Corporation.  Microsoft announced that Facebook users would be able to access their profiles and share photos on their television through the Xbox Live network and that Twitter devotees would also be able to post and read messages through the service.  More far-reaching was Microsoft’s new deal with Sky, under which Xbox Live users in Britain will be able to watch live television, including professional soccer, over an Internet version of the Sky service. Not every channel available over satellite will be available over Xbox Live, but the offering will include dozens of stations, Microsoft executives said. Users will be able to watch television in a virtual party room with their friends, discussing the program as they are watching, they said.  Microsoft has long sought a bigger role in home television, going so far in years past as to try to build its own set-top box business. Partnering with Sky represents a back door into the television market. The company has also recognized how Nintendo has expanded the traditional audience for video games with its innovative motion-sensitive controller for the Wii. Microsoft provided the first public demonstration of its futuristic Project Natal, which it hopes will usher in an age of completely controller-free gaming.  Using a sophisticated camera, infrared sensors and voice recognition software, Natal allows users to control a game or other programs, like a virtual painting studio, merely by waving their arms, speaking to the system and moving around. Microsoft did not say when the technology would become available. Microsoft also demonstrated some of its coming big games, including Forza Motorsport 3, the suspense-thriller Alan Wake and a new version of its biggest hit, Halo. Hideo Kojima, the developer behind the Metal Gear series, said that the next major installment in that franchise would be available for Xbox 360, a coup for Microsoft because previous Metal Gear games had been exclusive to Sony game machines."

                "Raising the ante in the video game wars, Microsoft is bringing out a new version of the Xbox 360 game machine that has a bigger hard drive, better high-definition video support and a stylish black finish, not an insignificant feature in a world where looking cool ranks high. The idea is to appeal to an elite class of hard-core game players who would like a little more of everything. \"Today's games-and-entertainment enthusiast has an insatiable appetite for digital high-definition content,\" said Peter Moore, corporate vice president for Microsoft's interactive entertainment business, in Redmond, Washington. The Xbox 360 Elite, which was to be announced Wednesday and will be in stores in late April, will have a list price of $479, or $80 more than the Xbox 360 Pro and $180 more than the basic Xbox 360. The new model has a 120-gigabyte hard drive, in contrast to the standard model's 20-gigabyte drive. It also has a high-definition multimedia interface port and cable, and a wireless controller and headset. Current Xbox 360 owners can buy the new 120-gigabyte hard drive as a separate accessory for $179. Microsoft is clearly hoping to fill what it sees as a hole at the top end of the market. The Nintendo Wii has been outselling the PlayStation 3 from Sony and the Xbox 360 in recent months, but that system is largely positioned as a family-friendly game machine that can be purchased for $50 less than the lowest-priced Xbox. The Sony system is priced higher than both the Nintendo and the Microsoft systems, with the cheapest model priced at $499. Both Microsoft and Sony have positioned their consoles as entertainment hubs, not just for playing sophisticated video games but also for listening to music and viewing downloaded movies and television shows. John Rodman, group product manager for the Xbox platform and Xbox Live, pointed to a recent Microsoft survey showing that nearly 40 percent of the time Xbox 360 users spent with their consoles was for activities other than gaming. Yet when it comes to gaming, Xbox 360 users are serious, Rodman says. Six out of 10 Xbox 360 users use Xbox Live, Microsoft's online gaming service. \"We don't feel like the Wii customer and the Xbox customer are the same thing,\" he said. \"We think that as soon as the Wii customer turns 14 they want something else.\" James McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester Research, said that Microsoft hoped to encourage customers to spend more money downloading movies and games, which require considerable hard-drive space."

                " NEW YORK — Buyers of the Xbox 360, Microsoft's second-generation video game console, will expect to play big, expensive marquee games like \"Call of Duty 2\" from Activision and \"Madden NFL 06\" by Electronic Arts. But Microsoft is also banking on them to play small arcade-style video games, purchased and downloaded from the Internet. Unlike its competitors, the Sony PlayStation 2 and Nintendo GameCube, the new Xbox, which goes on sale on Nov. 22, can play games on two separate tracks. One is the familiar terrain of big-budget, deeply immersive games that feel more like interactive movies than games. The other is a return to the video game's arcade roots. But the arcade games are not simple, said Greg Canessa, group manager of Xbox Live Arcade, part of the Xbox division.\"Arcade games are really miniature Xbox 360 games,\" he said. The price is somewhat miniaturized as well. To develop the arcade games cost $100,000 to $200,000, compared with $15 million to $20 million for the larger games. The arcade games will be sold only online, downloadable through the Xbox's broadband-only Internet connection. Microsoft has not officially announced prices for the games, but it is widely expected that they will cost $5 to $10. By contrast, new Xbox games sold at retailers like Best Buy are likely to cost $60, or about $10 more than previous Xbox games, according to some game publishers. The new machines, slimmer and more powerful than the original Xbox released in 2001, will cost $300 for a basic model and $400 for a model with a 20-gigabyte hard drive. They will also be able to play DVDs, CDs and standard music files, including MP3 and Windows Media Audio files, as well as display digital snapshots on a TV screen. Those functions and the arcade-type gaming feature are central to Microsoft's strategy to reach a broader family market, beyond the young male players who have been the Xbox's primary audience.To do that, Peter Moore, vice president for marketing at Xbox International, said Microsoft would eliminate the need for credit cards in making online purchases of games, accessories and upgrades. Instead of credit cards, the Xbox Live online service will accept Microsoft value cards that can be bought in various denominations online or at retail and convenience stores, Moore said. The value cards would function, in effect, like tokens in an arcade. \"We have to get credit cards out of the way,\" he said. \"We've got to broaden this to younger demographics.\" Another big selling point for the 360 is its enhanced Internet connectivity through the Xbox Live service.Microsoft will give Xbox 360 owners a free subscription to Xbox Live Silver, which gives players access to the online system's features, including the ability to buy and download games. A Gold membership, at $50 a year, permits users to play games with others over the Internet. Canessa, the group manager of Xbox Live Arcade, said that each arcade game could play at 1080i high definition and that most could take advantage of the 360's ability to communicate with other players over a broadband Internet connection. \"We will have from 12 to 15 games by launch,\" Canessa said. At least 75 percent, he added, will be capable of being played live online by more than one player.Each Xbox 360, he said, will include a free copy of the full version of \"Hexic HD,\" an arcade-style puzzle game developed by Alexey Pajitnov, the creator of \"Tetris.\" \"We created a whole market, a whole new world, for downloadable games,\" Canessa said. While online arcade games have proved popular on personal computers, Canessa said he believed that the 360's embrace of arcade games would further invigorate independent game design. \"The indie game developers is one of the opportunities I'm most excited about,\" he said. \"You have small, independent, three guys in a garage making games, totally innovating. It's the Sundance Film Festival, if you will, of games.\" "

                " SEATTLE — In a bid to make its games unit profitable by 2007, Microsoft is planning to start selling a more expensive version of its Xbox game console this autumn. The premium Xbox 360 console will sell for $399.99 in the United States, nearly three times the price of the current Xbox, according to an announcement made by Microsoft on Wednesday. The premium console will sell for399.99, or $490.67, in Continental Europe, while its scaled-back version, called \"Xbox 360 Core System,\" will sell for $299.99 in the United States and299.99 in Europe. Microsoft is counting on the new releases of its console to make its video game unit profitable by 2007, according to Robert Bach, senior vice president for Microsoft's home and entertainment division. The game unit of Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, has lost $2.8 billion in the last three years, while Sony's rival console, the PlayStation, is profitable. Bach predicted that the Xbox 360 would outsell Sony's PlayStation 3, which is scheduled for release next year, even though the PlayStation 2 has outsold the Xbox by nearly 4 to 1. Various Xbox accessories, like a 20-gigabyte detachable hard drive and a wireless controller that will be delivered with the premium version of the console, will also be available for purchase as an add-on for the less expensive \"core\" console. Microsoft is also planning to sell other Xbox accessories, like a wireless controller and TV remote, a headset for the Xbox Live online service and an Ethernet cable for high-speed Internet connections. The company said that it remained on target to ship the new Xbox to stores in North America, Europe and Japan in time for the upcoming holiday season, ahead of Sony's PlayStation 3, which is slated to replace the PlayStation 2 in the spring. Bach noted that both new versions of the Xbox would support high-definition visuals and play music and movies. These features were not part of the original Xbox release, which cost $299 four years ago but now sells for $150. Matt Rosoff, an analyst at the independent research firm Directions on Microsoft, said he doubted that enthusiasts would balk at the price increase for the new releases.\"Hard-core gamers will be on board,\" Rosoff said. \"I think the sticker shock might be in the larger audience Microsoft is trying to reach,\" like casual game players and neophytes, he added. Microsoft sells its current Xbox console at a loss because its primary goal was to break into the lucrative game market. It makes money selling games, but does not expect its home and entertainment division to post profits regularly until 2007. \"They need to not lose a lot of money on the console this time,\" said Ben Bajarin, an analyst at Creative Strategies in Campbell, California. \"They'd like to get closer to a small margin of profit on the console.\" The core console will not be able to play games designed for the original Xbox unless a consumer spends $99.99 to add a hard drive. Microsoft has asked developers working on future games to make them in such a way that they could be played on both the fully loaded and basic versions of the console. Pricing for the new Xbox in Japan, where Microsoft sells just a few hundred consoles a week, will not be announced until the Tokyo Game Show in September, Bach said. "

                " SAN JOSE, California — The tit-for- tat battle for customers between Sony and Microsoft continued Thursday as the Japanese electronics group announced plans to introduce an online gaming service when its PlayStation 3 video game console is released in the fall. The news of the service, which lets users buy games and communicate and compete with other players via the Web, comes days after Tokyo-based Sony said that it would delay the release of its next-generation PlayStationconsole until November, putting it a year behind Microsoft's popular Xbox 360. The much-awaited start had originally been scheduled for the spring and the news, on March 15, prompted Microsoft to announce this week that it was more than doubling shipments of the Xbox 360. Phil Harrison, president of worldwide studios for Sony Computer Entertainment, said that the basic level of Sony's online service, known internally as PlayStation Network Platform, would be free, and would allow users to play against each other online, e-mail and chat with friends. Additional game services and premium content will be made available to users who pay a subscription fee, Harrison said. Sony, one of the world's leading technology manufacturers and entertainment companies, is hoping to retain its dominance over the roughly $30 billion global video game market with the PS3. Microsoft introduced the Xbox 360 game console in November. The company's Xbox Live subscription service, which offers game downloads and online play, has been a hit on the new machine and Sony had been widely expected to offer a similar service. Built in collaboration with Sony Online Entertainment, which already offers PC game downloads and a marketplace for trading virtual assets, the service was inspired by businesses like the online auction site eBay and the online retailer Amazon.com, where communities of users contribute ratings and recommendations. It also steals a page from social networking sites like Myspace.com, which has attracted millions of users. \"We have to fall into step with consumer expectations,\" said Harrison, who said the social aspects of the network promise to get people more involved in gaming. With broadband adoption on the rise and television viewership dropping, advertisers are exploring the possibility of buying ad space in games much like they now do on the Web. \"This can provide a tremendous revenue stream for our industry,\" Harrison said. Video game makers, which have seen sales fall as gamers wait and save for new consoles, have been under pressure to find new ways to offset rising game development costs. Microsoft said Tuesday that Xbox Live had logged more than 10 million downloads.More than 85 percent of Xbox 360 consoles that are connected to the Internet have downloaded games, trailers and videos from the subscription service, Microsoft said. Downloads appeal to many game makers, because they can cut costs by selling direct to consumers. Online distribution also gives them a way to head off piracy and used game sales by providing a way to check that the player of a game is also its owner. Anita Frazier, an analyst with NPD Group, a market research company, said most publishers were \"treading lightly\" into direct online sales of games because they do not want to alienate retailers, but added that such services would likely open the market for more games.$@ "

                "Executives at Microsoft are fond of saying that its subscription gaming service, Xbox Live, should be thought of as a cable channel. They want Xbox to be seen not merely as a gaming machine for teenagers, but as a media portal for parents and grandparents, too. The company is even producing shows for users: it is in the middle of the second season of “1 vs. 100,” an interactive version of a game show that was on NBC. The content ambitions do not end there. Microsoft has held in-depth talks with the Walt Disney Company about a programming deal with ESPN, according to people close to the talks, who requested anonymity because the talks were intended to be private. For a per-subscriber fee, ESPN could provide live streams of sporting events, similar to the ones available through ESPN 360, a service that is available from some high-speed Internet providers. Microsoft could also create some interactive games in association with ESPN, the people said. One of the people said the deal was not imminent. The companies declined to comment. Already, video game consoles are putting a new emphasis on the video, rather than the game.  The roughly 20 million monthly members of Xbox Live can surf Facebook, browse an online mall of movies and TV episodes and, if they pay, watch Netflix.  “It’s 20 million connected living rooms,” said Marc Whitten, the general manager of Xbox Live. Similarly, users of the Sony PlayStation can tune into BBC shows and see Weather Channel updates, as well as stream Netflix. Last week, Netflix extended its streaming service to the Nintendo Wii.  Among the many companies that want to transport the on-demand qualities of the Internet into the living room  the over-the-top model, in industry parlance  the console makers have a significant head start. Nearly 60 percent of American homes now have at least one console, according to the consulting firm Deloitte, up from 44 percent three years ago. “For both of the big guys, it’s about extending the value of the hardware platform,” said Mike McGuire, a vice president for the research firm Gartner, referring to Microsoft and Sony. “The devices are hooked to TVs and have broadband connections, and there are more and more opportunities to license movies and TV shows and deliver them in over-the-top models.” Microsoft said this month that it had sold 39 million Xbox 360 consoles around the world. About half sign into Xbox Live each month. At that size, “it starts to feel like a cable network,” said Mark Kroese, who oversees Xbox advertising sales for Microsoft. The company does not specify how many members pay for access to premium services like Netflix; basic functions of Xbox Live are free. The company says it regularly counts more than a million concurrent users  and topped out at 2.2 million at one point during Christmas week last month. That compares favorably to some of the top channels on cable, like TBS and the Cartoon Network, which reach about one million viewers at any given time, according to the Nielsen Company.  The comparisons are crude at best because many of Xbox Live’s users are playing games rather than watching video. No third-party measurement exists, because ratings companies like Nielsen do not yet track the service fully. But there is no doubt that consoles are expanding their domain, something that is evident in Mr. Whitten’s vision of the service: “The entertainment you want, the people you care about, wherever you are.” The addition of Netflix in late 2008 was an important step into the entertainment arena for Xbox, and perhaps a precursor to Microsoft’s current talks with Hollywood producers. Without releasing specific numbers, Mr. Whitten said the streaming movies and TV service were “very, very popular,” including in his own household. Mr. Whitten said Microsoft wanted to be a bigger player in television and film viewing. He declined to comment on the conversations with Disney but said more than once that “there’s going to be a ton of experimentation around business models and rights.” “Our goal is, really, how can we get as much content there as possible,” he said. Disney is not alone in showing an interest in the console market. Many companies sell TV episodes and film rentals through Microsoft’s online store, and Web video ventures are clamoring to have a place on the service. Console makers have a long way to go to be considered replacements for cable subscriptions, but, at the very least, they could put a dent in the time spent viewing traditional TV. The interactive game show “1 vs. 100” drew well over 100,000 concurrent users at times during its first season last year, according to Microsoft’s internal data. During the second season, which began in November, two-hour TV-style trivia competitions are scheduled on Tuesday and Friday nights. A voice-over announcer, shown onscreen as an avatar, provides live color commentary. Like the defunct NBC show, the game has a contestant, “The One,” and a “Mob” of 100 other players. Members of the audience can watch passively or play along, improving their odds of being picked to play for prizes. Unlike on the live-action TV show, every player on Xbox is represented by a cartoonish avatar. Dave McCarthy, a general manager at Microsoft Game Studios, said the scheduled TV-style shows provided a guarantee that “you’re a part of something bigger.” Beyond the game show realm, Microsoft also exclusively shows “The Guild,” a sitcom that it bills as “Seinfeld” meets video game culture. It stars its creator, the actress Felicia Day, and is sponsored by Sprint. For advertisers like Sprint, online communities like Xbox Live are another arena to pursue consumers. Within “1 vs. 100” there are 15- and 30-second commercial breaks like on TV. Those spots account for about 15 percent of the service’s advertising revenue; most of the rest comes from ads on Xbox Live navigation pages, like display ads on Web sites.  In November, Nielsen started to track “1 vs. 100” play and ad views. The pilot program “is the tip of the iceberg,” said Gerardo Guzman, a director for Nielsen Games; eventually, he hopes to generate TV-style ratings. Mr. Kroese said Xbox advertisers were “very interested in being able to compare the media buy on Xbox to other media buys they do.” Microsoft says nearly half of Xbox Live members use its entertainment content; the rest mostly play multiplayer games. But it expects that more of its users will try the entertainment side and the line between them will blur further. “I don’t think there’s a real difference between a game and ‘Lost.’ Or a game and ‘American Idol.’ They’re all ways we spend our leisure time,” Mr. Whitten said.  Over time, he predicted, “these narrow swim lanes  games, music, movies, etc.  will dissolve.”"

                "LOS ANGELES, July 5 — In what may be one of the costliest consumer warranty repairs in history, Microsoft announced on Thursday that it would spend up to $1.15 billion to repair failing Xbox 360 game machine consoles. While the company would not say how many units were failing, Robbie Bach, president of Microsoft’s entertainment and devices division, said that there have been an “unacceptable high number of repairs.” The majority of Xbox 360 owners, he said, have not experienced hardware failure.  Company officials said that Microsoft had sold 11.6 million Xbox 360 units by the end of June, shy of the 12 million units the company had predicted. The Xbox 360, which first went of sale in November 2005, is currently the best-selling game machine in the United States, according to NPD, a market research firm. The size of the anticipated repair bill suggests that a third to as many as half of the machines are flawed.  Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., said it would take a charge of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion against earnings in the quarter ended June 30. Consumers know they have a problem if three red flashing lights appear on the console. Gamers on online forums have been referring to the event as “the Red Ring of Death” because the machine then shuts down.  The company declined to explain the nature of the failure, but said that it was not caused by a single problem in the console, which it said contained 1,700 components and 500 million transistors. The company also said there were no health or safety concerns involved. The problem began to appear over the last three to four months, Mr. Bach said, after “significant usage” of the consoles. He said the company has taken steps to correct the problem in new devices. Microsoft said it would extend the warranty of the game console to three years to customers worldwide. Previously, products sold in the United States were covered by a one-year warranty, while Xbox 360 units sold in Europe had a two-year warranty.  In addition, customers who have had their consoles repaired because of the “three flashing lights” problem will be reimbursed for the cost of the repairs. Microsoft has succeeded in establishing the Xbox brand against the better known Sony PlayStation and other game machines. The Xbox and its successor, the Xbox 360, was the software maker’s first major foray into hardware. Although sales are small relative to the rest of Microsoft’s revenue, the Xbox has been an important venture for the company and was viewed by many analysts as Microsoft’s attempt to compete with the likes of Sony and Apple for control of electronics and entertainment within homes.  The device can be used to access the Internet and view movies. Microsoft said its entertainment and devices division reported an operating loss of $315 million on $929 million in revenue for the three-month period that ended in March, and analysts have estimated that the company lost about $6 billion getting a foothold in the game machine industry.  A new Xbox 360 with a 20-gigabyte hard drive sells for about $400, but other versions cost about $300.  The announcement comes on the eve of the E3 Media and Business Summit, the video-game industry’s major trade show, to be held next week in Los Angeles. “This is bound to affect discussions between Microsoft and its developers and retailers,” said Richard Doherty, a partner in the research company Envisioneering Group."

                "One of the enduring attractions of comic books and graphic novels is the ease with which they explain the universe. Evil is identifiable, external and fairly simple to vanquish with the application of the appropriate superpowers. And sometimes, as in the case of ABC Family’s new comic-based series “The Middleman,” evil is downright funny. In “Middleman’s” first episode, last week, a slimy, many-eyed, multitentacled creature erupts in a DNA lab. Later, evil’s personification is a mobster ape with a machine gun. These over-the-top creatures are more comic than threatening. Usually the phrase “cartoonish violence” is a pejorative; here it’s a compliment. “The Middleman,” written as a graphic novel by Javier Grillo-Marxuach, who has also written for the series “Lost” and “Medium,” stars Matt Keeslar in the title role, a straight-arrow, milk-drinking former member of the Navy Seals who stands between us and horrors we’re not even aware of, fighting evil “so you don’t have to.” He dresses like a Canadian Mountie and delivers his lines with the stone-face confidence of a young Peter Graves. Early on, he explains the world to his protégée. “You know how in comic books there’s all kinds of mad scientists and aliens and androids and monsters who want to either take over or destroy the world?” he asks. “Well, it really does work like that.” This is news to Wendy Watson (Natalie Morales), an art-school graduate and temp secretary whose calm in the face of the multitentacled slime creature  she stabs it with a letter opener  inspires the Middleman to recruit her. “You’re good under pressure,” he says. She asks, “Are you hitting on me?” There is some sexual tension between these two, but you hope it won’t become a big part of the story; there’s much more interesting material here. “Middleman” is full of hilarious throwaways, as when our hero, preparing to drink a glass of “cool refreshing milk” with some bad guys, empties his pockets  of grenades, flamethrowers and a crossbow.  The genius is in the details. When the Middleman asks Wendy if she has experience with firearms, and she says she’s a pacifist, he looks at her fingers. Their calluses tell him that she is a veteran Xbox player. “You probably have better hand-eye than a bush sniper,” he concludes. “Middleman” skillfully incorporates real-life details into its fantastic scenarios. Its characters aren’t just Manichaean warriors; they also live the kinds of lives that people read comic books to escape from. “Did I get any calls?” Wendy asks her roommate after a rough day at the office. The roommate says: “Yeah. Your mom called to ask if you’re a lesbian.” That would be the mom whom Wendy describes as “on me 24/7 to quit painting, move back to Orlando, meet a good man, eat fried foods, swell up like a tick and start squeezing out calves like Elsie mainlining fertility drugs.” Then there’s the motive of the mad scientist who created the gun-toting ape; she’s just trying to compensate for federal cuts to her research grants. Saving the world is easy; making a world as complex and funny as this one is the real feat of “Middleman.” THE MIDDLEMAN ABC Family, Monday nights at 8, Eastern and Pacific times; 7, Central time. Created by Javier Grillo-Marxuach, based on his Viper Comics graphic novels, with illustrations by Les McClaine; directed by Jeremiah Chechik; Mr. Grillo-Marxuach and John Ziffren, executive producers; Hans Beimler, co-executive producer; Jon Pare, producer; Sarah Watson, co-producer; Mr. Chechik and Tracey Stern, supervising producers.  WITH: Matt Keeslar (the Middleman), Natalie Morales (Wendy Watson), Mary Pat Gleason (Ida), Brit Morgan (Lacey) and Jake Smollett (Noser)."

                "TOKYO, Dec. 16 - In the United States, Microsoft's Xbox 360 video game console has been so popular it is hard to keep on store shelves. But in Tokyo's neon-drenched Akihabara neighborhood, known as Electronics Town, there are plenty of the sleek white machines to go around, if you can find takers. At Yodobashi Camera, an eight-story electronics department store selling everything from hair curlers to home computer servers, a small corner display of Xbox 360's draws little attention from passing shoppers. It is not hard to figure out why. Lined up on a rack near the display are the only nine games sold for Xbox 360. But behind it are some 3,000 games, spread across six store aisles, for Microsoft's biggest rival here, the Sony PlayStation 2. \"Xbox doesn't even have Gran Turismo,\" said Shun'ichi Moriizumi, naming a popular auto racing game. One of the few shoppers to stop in front of the Xbox display, Mr. Moriizumi, a 22-year-old university student, said he came to see the Xbox 360, which went on sale here Dec. 10, 18 days after its debut in the United States. \"I like the graphics,\" he said \"But I'm not going to buy it, at least not today. I'm waiting until the new PlayStation comes out before deciding which to buy.\" That appears to be a common sentiment in Japan, the world's second-largest video game market after the United States. The Xbox 360 had a disappointing opening day in Japan. During the first weekend the Xbox 360 was in stores, Microsoft sold 62,135 of about 159,000 machines shipped, or about 39 percent, according to a Japanese market research company, Enterbrain. That pace was even slower than in 2002, when Microsoft introduced its earlier Xbox model in Japan, where it was considered a flop. Microsoft was hoping to make a bigger splash this time, not just because of the market's size here but also because of Japan's importance as a proving ground for new products. Japan is, after all, home to Microsoft's two biggest rivals in video games, Sony and Nintendo, and its software companies write many of the games played worldwide, from Super Mario Brothers to Final Fantasy. Winning over Japan's finicky consumers, who are known to reject games for seemingly minor shortcomings in performance and appearance, represents a coveted seal of approval, analysts say. So far, Microsoft has failed the test. As of June, the latest data available, 470,000 Xbox machines over all have been sold in Japan, versus 13 million in the United States, according to the market research site Famitsu.com. That gave Xbox a mere 2 percent slice of the 22 million game machines sold in Japan. By contrast, Xbox had a 25 percent share of the 52 million machines sold in the United States, according to Famitsu. Analysts say the biggest hurdle the Xbox 360 faces in Japan is the dominance of Sony and to a lesser extent Nintendo. Sony has 81 percent of the Japanese market; Nintendo has most of the rest, according to Famitsu. Worldwide, PlayStation's market share is about 68 percent; Xbox is in second place with 17 percent and Nintendo has the rest. Microsoft had hoped to steal a march by rolling out its next-generation XBox game machine ahead of its two Japanese rivals. Sony plans to sell its newest game console, PlayStation 3, in the spring, though the company will not say exactly when. Nintendo says it will release its new console, Revolution, in 2006. But Microsoft's strategy does not seem to be working, analysts say. One problem they note is that Microsoft introduced Xbox 360 before there was much game software to play on it. That makes the Xbox 360 less attractive next to the vastly larger number of games available for PlayStation. Microsoft says more games are in the pipeline, including the latest version of the popular Dead or Alive, which is supposed to go on sale here later this month. \"We didn't have a rocket start,\" said Asako Miyata, a spokeswoman in Japan for Microsoft. \"But we see sales steadily picking up as more games become available.\" Analysts say, however, that even when more games appear, Microsoft may have trouble luring first-time buyers because of the need to replace their game software libraries. Because so many consumers now own PlayStation 2, it would be easier for them to wait for the arrival of PlayStation 3, which would be able to play all their current games, . \"Sony has such a high penetration rate,\" said John Yang, an electronics analyst in Tokyo for Standard & Poor's rating agency. \"It is not uncommon for households here to have two or even three PS2's,\" he said, referring to the current PlayStation model. \"Why would an entire household want to switch to Xbox?\" Takashi Sudo, a manager for the video game department at the Yodobashi Camera store, said several hundred people showed up for the opening day of Xbox 360 at his store. But he said he expected a crowd at least five times as large for the PlayStation 3 debut in the spring. For that, he says, he will need to set up a line of special booths to handle the crunch. \"This is Sony's country,\" Mr. Sudo said. \"Xbox has to break into a market that Sony built.\""

                "SANTA MONICA, Calif., July 10 — As Microsoft executives played down the impact of an extensive repair program for defective Xbox 360 game machines, they announced several efforts to broaden the appeal of their machine to families.  Opening the annual E3 game conference here, Microsoft executives announced a deal to distribute films from the Walt Disney Company on Microsoft’s Xbox Live Internet service and outlined a broader array of games focused mostly on children and families.  Executives predicted that the company’s recently announced plan to spend up to $1.15 billion to fix defective Xbox 360 game machine would improve, not undermine, the system’s image with consumers.   “The important impact for us is that our customers know we’re going to support the console and support them and if they have issues, we’ll take care of it,” said Robert J. Bach, president of Microsoft’s entertainment and devices division, in an interview. “It won’t change what’s happening in the marketplace because the industry is about the games and we think we have the games that will get people really excited this year.”  As the game industry’s growth has slowed in recent years, game developers have tried to reach beyond the young male players who have been the target audience.  “We believe we have the best game lineup in video-game history for the holiday season,” said Mr. Bach. “You can look top to bottom and we think we have the goods to please any type of gamer.”  Part of Microsoft’s strategy has been to position the Xbox 360 as a living room media hub and an essential element of that plan has been allowing users to download films and television shows to the machine. Adding Disney to the roster of companies distributing movies and video programming over the Xbox Live service should help broaden the appeal of the game system to families with children. The same could be said of the new games Microsoft announced here, including a new installment of the company’s Viva Pinata game and a version of the Scene It? board game. Scene It? will come with a new controller for the Xbox 360 with large buttons and a simple layout that game novices, intimidated by a traditional game controller, may find easier to use “Part of our strategy is we want to win this generation and in order to do that we have to expand beyond the core gamer audience that we’ve had success with and that means appealing to the broad consumer market,” said Shane Kim, general manager of Microsoft Game Studios. The company also said it was developing a keyboard for the Xbox 360 controller. Currently, Xbox Live users send text messages using an on-screen keyboard. The company recently announced plans to integrate the popular Windows Live Messenger service with Xbox Live.  But even as Microsoft hopes to appeal to new sorts of users, the company wants to avoid neglecting the serious player. So Microsoft also said that the next version of the popular Resident Evil series from Capcom of Japan would also be designed to run on the Xbox 360.   In the past, Resident Evil games have run only on Nintendo and Sony consoles. Persuading Capcom to develop games for the Xbox 360 underlines the success Microsoft has had recently in attracting Japanese developers who had shied away from the American console. "

                "AFTER a 31-year-old Manhattan financial executive received Microsoft's Xbox video game system as a gift in January, he walked to a store and bought a half-dozen game titles. The video game industry would have been pleased to hear it. After he played those games a few times against computer-controlled opponents, he got a bit bored and signed up for Microsoft's Xbox Live service, which enabled him to play against other people online. The video game industry, again, would have been pleased. After a few months on the Xbox Live network, in May, he got a bit bored again. This time, however, he opened his Xbox and soldered in a chip that allowed him to change the console's basic computer code and bypass its internal security technology. After installing a new hard drive, he transferred about 3,000 MP3 music files to the system and downloaded illegal copies of 3,500 old-time arcade games. Then he installed the Linux operating system, which allowed him to use the box essentially as a personal computer. Needless to say, the video game industry would not have been pleased. When Microsoft released the Xbox in November 2001, it was heralded as far more than a game machine. Even as the Xbox took aim at Sony's PlayStation 2 game empire, the console was meant to lead Microsoft's broader invasion of the living room. Incorporating a hard drive, which made it more readily adaptable than other consoles, the Xbox had the potential to be a digital-entertainment nerve center. Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, said at the time, ''We're going to put new software that runs on Xbox that, both in the gaming dimension and other dimensions, will amaze people with the power that's in this box.'' That is happening, but not necessarily as Microsoft planned. All sorts of new software is indeed running on Xbox consoles these days, and they are in fact becoming home-entertainment hubs, but it is not Microsoft doing the amazing. Rather, an online confederacy apparently numbering in the thousands -- including accomplished hackers of varied motives and everyday technophiles like the Manhattan financial executive (who shared his experience on the condition of anonymity) -- is taking the lead. Those involved often call their efforts ''unleashing'' or ''unshackling'' -- freeing the Xbox to express its inner PC. Technology industry executives, however, often call such activity a bald attempt to hijack the Xbox illegally. It is a battle that involves many of the ethical and legal issues facing the technology and media industries at this digital moment. What rights do consumers have to tinker with products they own? How far should companies go to protect their intellectual property? What happens when the desires of consumers conflict with the business models of companies they patronize? Who gets to decide just what a particular product may be used for? The Xbox is a particularly attractive target for hackers because while it is essentially a standard PC modified to do only a few things, like play Xbox games, it is much cheaper than a PC. It is like an economy car modified to follow only a few roads -- but one potentially as powerful as a far more expensive model. In the Xbox, that power comes in the form of a 733-megahertz Intel processor, comparable to a midrange personal computer, and sophisticated graphics and audio systems. Its limited operating system, based on a version of Windows, can be used by a programmer to run simple software like a music player -- or the machine can run a new operating system altogether, namely Linux. ''The reality is that if you could bypass Microsoft's operating system you would end up with a fairly powerful computer for less than $200,'' the Manhattan financial executive said. In fact, Microsoft lowered the price for Xbox to $179.99 in May. In a sense, Xbox hackers are exploiting Microsoft's business model, which is to sell Xbox hardware at a loss (to build penetration of the system) and make the money back on royalties from the sale of Xbox software. A PC manufacturer like Dell, meanwhile, has to recoup its costs and generate a profit from the initial sale. So someone who buys the Xbox hardware, modifies it into a general-purpose computer and does not buy Xbox games potentially undermines not only Microsoft but also the personal computer industry. But that is not how some Xbox hackers think about it. ''Especially in Europe, computers are more expensive than they are here, and the Xbox is the cheapest computer you can get,'' Andrew Huang, author of a new book called ''Hacking the Xbox: An Introduction to Reverse Engineering,'' said in a telephone interview. ''Basically,'' he added by e-mail, ''once you have Linux, you have everything.'' It is unclear just how many Xbox hackers there are. Officials of the Interactive Digital Software Association, a trade group of video game publishers, said that Xbox hacking appeared more prevalent in parts of Asia than in North America. Michael Steil, a 24-year-old German who is project leader of a group that calls itself the Xbox Linux Project, said by e-mail that a full version of Linux software for the Xbox had been downloaded more than 220,000 times. Whatever the numbers, Microsoft does not appear eager to discuss Xbox hacking. In recent weeks, a Microsoft public relations representative repeatedly declined to make any company executives available to discuss the matter. Instead, the company issued a statement through a public relations firm that said in part: ''Microsoft is a company passionate about innovation and creativity. We are also very committed to respect for others' intellectual property and we request the same respect applied to our innovations.'' The statement made no reference to the potential use of hacked Xbox consoles as personal computers, saying Microsoft's ''primary concern'' was with the sale of modified chips for the boxes ''that enable game counterfeiting.'' And that is the area that most clearly raises legal issues. Although there are several methods, hacking an Xbox typically involves obtaining a special chip called a modchip, available on the Internet, and soldering it into the machine. (For those who find the process daunting, there are also vendors on the Internet who sell ''pre-modded'' Xbox units.) Modchips, of which there are several varieties, allow users to load new versions of the basic computer code, known as the BIOS, that tells the machine how to operate. A hacked BIOS generally incorporates modified versions of copyrighted Microsoft code and so is generally illegal. The main Web sites that deal with Xbox hacking do not include links to hacked BIOS, and hackers generally find their forbidden fruit in Internet chat rooms. Once the modchip is installed and the BIOS modified, the console can do a number of things it cannot do ''out of the box.'' Xbox games normally must be run from an optical disk, and a hacked Xbox can ''back up'' a game to the unit's hard drive and run the game without the disk. This technique could be used simply to avoid having to insert and remove disks -- or it could be used for piracy (say, by renting a game, putting the software on the hard drive and returning the game). Until passage of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act in 1998, the mere sale of a modified chip would not have appeared illegal. That law, however, prohibits the sale of devices that are primarily meant to circumvent copyright protection. Companies and technologists will fight over the exact legal meaning of those provisions for years. For now, however, the software industry is relying on them. ''Our view over all on modchips is that they are illegal infringing devices, that where we find people engaged in the widespread manufacturing and distribution of them, we and our members, individually and collectively, are committed to doing what we can to shut down their manufacturing and go after the distributors,'' said Doug Lowenstein, president of the Interactive Digital Software Association. Some advocates, however, say that while software piracy is illegal and morally offensive, the mere act of modifying hardware should not be illegal. ''The most important dimension of this debate from our view is that people should have the right to tinker with the stuff that they own,'' said Fred von Lohmann, senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a civil-liberties group in San Francisco. ''Others will say that this is about piracy and all that, but they forget that the principle of tinkering with the stuff that you own was the principle on which the entire personal computer industry was founded,'' he added. ''This is basic business and basic science in the technology world and we think that this right to tinker, this freedom to tinker, remains legally protected.'' For now, however, the federal government seems to agree with Mr. Lowenstein. Last December, David M. Rocci, a 22-year-old from Blacksburg, Va., pleaded guilty to a federal charge of conspiring to import, market and sell modchips for the Xbox. In April, he was sentenced to five months in prison and five months of home detention. Simply from the standpoint of accessibility, the PlayStation 2 would seem to be a more likely candidate for hacking. IDG, the technology research firm, estimates that at the end of last year, 38.1 million PlayStation 2 units were in use in Europe, North America and Japan combined, compared with 6.7 million Xbox units in those regions. In one sense, however, the hacking scene for PlayStation 2 is less developed than the one for Xbox because there is less appetite for it. Sony sells an official conversion kit for the PlayStation 2 that includes a hard drive and allows that system to run the Linux operating system, which in turn allows the system to run MP3's, movies, spreadsheets or any other program or data that works under Linux. It is relatively easy for Sony to embrace Linux because Sony, unlike Microsoft, is not in the operating system business. The PlayStation 2 hacking community seems focused on developing chips that allow PlayStation 2 units to run illegal copies of games and games meant for far-flung parts of the world. (For marketing reasons, many PlayStation 2 games include regional coding, much as DVD's do.) In 2001, Sony sued an Australian for selling modchips that allowed Australian PlayStation 2 units to play games from other parts of the world. After the Australian government argued on the man's behalf, however, the Federal Court of Australia last July ruled mostly against Sony. Mr. von Lohmann said that Microsoft had not been particularly aggressive in combating Xbox hackers but that Sony had actively fought them. A Sony spokeswoman did not respond this week to requests for comment about the company's approach to hackers. For its part, Microsoft, through its public relations agency, indicated that it believed Xbox hackers were a relatively small band. ''Aside from a set of hobbyists,'' it said, ''the vast majority of Xbox owners are not focused on this niche.'' But those who are appear quite focused indeed. By e-mail, Mr. Steil, the German leader of the Xbox Linux project, declared: ''In very simple words: The Xbox is cheaper than a PC. The Xbox is a lot smaller than a PC. The Xbox looks better (next to a TV set). The Xbox is more silent. Therefore it's an ideal Linux computer in the living room.'' That was probably not the vision Mr. Gates had in mind."

                "WHEN the dust finally settled on the 2006 holiday buying season, American consumers — who braved long lines, cold weather and possibly a few kicks to the shins — had spent $3.7 billion on new video-game consoles and software. And while the more than two million youngsters (and not-so-youngsters) who discovered a next-generation gaming system under the Christmas tree — a Microsoft Xbox 360, a Sony PlayStation 3 or a Nintendo Wii — represent a substantial user base for these platforms, they mean even more to the entertainment industry as a whole. To the makers of these video-game systems and to a growing number of film and television studios, they represent a significant new audience for full-length movies and television shows that can be downloaded directly to gaming consoles. In late November Microsoft began expanding the library on its Xbox Live network, a broadband service available by subscription to Xbox 360 owners. In addition to the video-game trailers and playable demonstrations that the network has traditionally offered, you can now find an eclectically selected collection of films and television shows offered for downloading to a console’s hard drive: for a few dollars you can view “Mission: Impossible III” or “Chinatown” or the episode of “Chappelle’s Show” with the blind white supremacist, on your television, just as if you were watching a DVD or a video-on-demand channel.  For gamers with top-shelf home-theater setups, Xbox Live also offers content in high definition: download the HD version of the “Star Trek” episode “Mirror, Mirror,” in which the Enterprise crew is accidentally beamed into a malevolent alternate reality, and you can practically count each strand of hair in evil Mr. Spock’s goatee. This month XBox Live will offer a new view of the corpulent form of Eric Cartman when it becomes the first outlet ever to offer an episode of “South Park” in high definition. While Microsoft acknowledges that most consumers are buying Xbox 360s primarily, if not solely, to play video games, the company also sees an opportunity to use film and television content to draw an audience that doesn’t fit the stereotypical gamer profile.  “The original Xbox was probably the domain of that testosterone-fueled male in the household, and while we love him to death, we also want his little brother and sister and mom and dad and their friends to be able to enjoy it,” said Peter Moore, corporate vice president of Microsoft’s interactive entertainment business division.  To that end Microsoft spent several months negotiating with Hollywood studios and television networks, including Warner Brothers, Paramount, CBS and MTV, to secure a broad variety of programming before rolling out the expanded Xbox Live service.  Although more than 4.5 million Xbox 360s have been sold, and some 60 percent of owners are connected to Xbox Live, the network’s audience will not make broadcast television or movie theaters obsolete any time soon. Yet the kind of content most abundantly available on the network — goofy comedies like “Nacho Libre” and “Zoolander,” clips of Nascar races and adventure films like “Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior” — clearly indicates whom Microsoft expects to make the most use of it: men in their 20s and 30s with enough disposable income to buy lots of video games.  “This guy is typically not going to the movies, and more often than not he’s not watching television, he’s playing games in the living room,” Mr. Moore said. “He’s a difficult person to get to in the first place.”  It is Xbox Live’s potential to deliver such a narrowly defined and increasingly difficult-to-reach demographic that makes it so enticing to the entertainment industry. “This is, to a large extent, an entirely new audience for us,” said Steve Beeks, the president of Lionsgate, an independent studio whose library includes horror movies like “The Descent” and the “Saw” franchise and which recently announced it would make its films available for download on Xbox Live. “These are active buyers of games, but we don’t believe they’ve been active buyers of movies. We’re turning them into consumers of films.”  For television networks whose programming appears on the service, Xbox Live offers the additional benefit of a precise metric to determine how many gamers are downloading their shows and how many are then seeking out these shows on broadcast television.  “We’re gauging how different clips translate into what kind of pickup in viewership we get and what kind of buzz we’re getting on the blogs,” said Dennis Quinn, Turner Broadcasting’s executive vice president for business development. “If they’re watching a six-minute clip of ‘Robot Chicken,’ is that translating into a greater sampling of the network show? If we see older shows like ‘Harvey Birdman’ picking up again, what does that mean for people who produce the content?” At least one of Microsoft’s competitors is also preparing to enter this digital arena. Sony’s PlayStation 3, which comes with the ability to play high-definition Blu-ray DVDs, also allows gamers to connect to Sony’s own broadband network. Right now that network doesn’t offer much more than video-game demos and movie trailers, but that will soon change.  “As long as you’re downloading a trailer, what’s to stop us from offering the entire program, whether it’s a movie or a TV show?” said Peter Dille, the senior vice president for marketing for Sony Computer Entertainment America. “Being part of Sony Corporation, with a film entertainment company as a sister company and a music company at arm’s length, the world is our oyster in many respects.” For the moment Nintendo has no immediate plans to make film and television programming available for its Wii game console, which also lets gamers connect to an Internet-based network of content channels. But the company did not rule out the possibility.  “There’s a lot of plans we have for the channels,” said Perrin Kaplan, Nintendo’s vice president for marketing. “And there are ways that they could be used that we haven’t yet really conceived of.” Though Microsoft is the only gaming company to provide a substantial content library (roughly 100 movies and several hundred television episodes so far), some gamers feel the offerings are too limited to encourage them to use the feature regularly.  “Until you feel like it’s a pretty comprehensive list where you can look up just about anything, it’s not a service that I think most people will use,” said Dan Hsu, editor in chief of Electronic Gaming Monthly magazine. “You can just go, ‘Well, maybe I’ll check the iTunes music store or nbc.com and see if they have the shows that I want.’ ”  Other industry executives say the current push to provide entertainment content has more to do with satisfying console manufacturers’ needs than with fulfilling gamers’ demands.  “For this round of consoles it makes total sense that they have to focus on entertainment,” said Ricardo Sanchez, an executive at GameTap, a service that lets subscribers play console and arcade games on their personal computers. “For Sony I’ve got to believe the PS3 is as much about establishing Blu-ray as it is about selling games. On the Microsoft side they’re betting so much on Xbox Live that they’ll do practically anything to drive awareness and interest in it.”  At the same time, Mr. Sanchez said, “I don’t see them spending a lot of effort, beyond just aggregating content you can get elsewhere.”  Most gamers understand that in exchange for the ability to watch “South Park” reruns on demand, they are giving the console makers something: a valuable piece of real estate in their home-theater cabinets that a DVD player or stereo receiver might otherwise occupy. That bargain is especially precious for Microsoft, which is still better known as a monolithic software company than a trusted manufacturer of home electronics.  “This is following years of Bill Gates wanting to pursue something around a set-top box,” said Josh Larson, the director of the video-game Web site GameSpot.com. “It’s kind of a Trojan horse into the living room.” But as media ploys go, Mr. Larson would rather download his movies from Xbox Live than from PC-based services like Movielink or Amazon.com’s Unbox. “Is it more likely for a gamer that you’re going to download from iTunes and hook your PC up to your TV set?” he asked. “Or a couple button-pushes and you’re watching it in a way that you’re used to watching that content? I think that’s pretty powerful.” Despite the enduring perception that his company is seeking to conquer the universe, Mr. Moore said Microsoft was looking only to provide an audience of savvy, affluent media consumers with the kind of products they want in the way they’ve grown accustomed to consuming them. “In my case,” he said, “I very rarely watch live television anymore. Shows like ‘Lost,’ I’ll wait for the DVD, thank you, rather than have to see it chopped up into five-minute increments with four minutes of commercials. In today’s world we don’t have appointment viewing anymore.” More recently, Mr. Moore said, he was looking to catch up on some recent episodes of “CSI” — in high-definition, preferably — and sure enough, the only place he could find them was on Xbox Live. “I live in Seattle,” he explained, “and I have DirecTV. They don’t put the local networks on in high-def.”"

                "Owners of Microsoft's Xbox 360 game console will soon be able to watch science fiction epics as well as play them. Microsoft said last night that it would offer movies and episodes of television shows for downloading through its Xbox Live online service in the United States, starting Nov. 22. With the new offerings, Microsoft is joining cable giants and Internet start-ups on the long list of companies hoping to profit from video downloading. But Internet-based services have had trouble getting traction because it can be complex to send a downloaded film to a television screen and frustrating to watch it on the small screen of a computer. Owners of the Xbox have already connected it to a TV and, in most cases, the Internet. \"What makes this big is that there's no PC in the middle,\" said Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group. Microsoft has negotiated the rights to rent or sell more than 1,000 hours of material from CBS, MTV Networks, Paramount, Warner Brothers and Turner Broadcasting, along with the martial arts show \"Ultimate Fighting Championship.\" Some programs will be available in high-definition video. The video store will work much like that of Apple Computer, with some important differences. While users will be able to keep television shows, movies can be rented for only a limited period. The videos will not be playable on other devices and cannot be burned onto DVDs, but the online service will keep track of purchases so that users can log in to watch their videos on a friend's Xbox. Peter Moore, Microsoft's corporate vice president for interactive entertainment, said that the price of standard-definition videos would be comparable to what competitors charged. Apple's iTunes charges $1.99 for an episode of a television program. High-definition content will cost more, Mr. Moore said, because of the costs involved in storing it and making it available for downloading. Purchases will be made with points that users can buy with a credit card or a gift certificate, or win in contests. Mr. Moore said the service was partly intended to make the Xbox more versatile and therefore more attractive. \"Direct revenue from this over the long term could be important,\" Mr. Moore said. \"But this is also another reason to buy an Xbox 360.\" New game consoles from Sony and Nintendo are due out this month, a year after the Xbox 360 went on sale, so extra features could help Microsoft keep up in the marketplace. Nintendo is concentrating on game play, but Sony says it also has other content in mind. \"We haven't announced any content besides games,\" said Dave Karraker, a spokesman for Sony Computer Entertainment America, \"but all the executives have said that downloading other entertainment content is something the PlayStation 3 is capable of doing.\" Judging by the initial offerings, Xbox Live will be something of a cyberspace version of the Spike Channel, MTV Networks' cable channel aimed at young men. It will sell episodes of \"Star Trek,\" remastered in high definition, as well as the \"C.S.I.\" shows, some music videos and cartoons from the Cartoon Network's \"Adult Swim.\" \"The interesting thing is that we're delivering the 18-to-34-year-olds who aren't watching TV,\" Mr. Moore said. Microsoft has sold more than two million Xbox 360 consoles in the United States, according to the NPD Group, a market research firm. Most of those who buy the machines sign up for the Xbox Live service, which requires broadband Internet access and allows users to compete against each other. Since the introduction of the Xbox 360 last year, the service has also sold simple video games and other material. This year, Microsoft started to hint at its ambitions for the Xbox Live service when it purchased a company that places advertising in video games and made an ad deal with Cadillac. In the last few years, Microsoft has been pushing the idea of Media Center PCs, which are meant to sit in the living room and supply music and video to the stereo and the television set. But the concept has not caught on, in part because of the complexity of setting up and using these systems. Mr. Enderle said that apart from simplicity, another feature that would set the XBox Live service apart is that it will be the first service to sell downloadable movies in high definition, at a resolution similar to or better than a DVD. Until now, he said, most studios have been reluctant to allow cable channels to show movies in high definition for fear of piracy, but that would be less of a threat on XBox Live. Early next year, Apple plans to introduce a product that, on a preliminary basis, it is calling iTV and that is intended to be a bridge between the computer and the television set. But Microsoft will go into the video business with a different business model. Apple, most analysts maintain, does not make much money selling iTunes content, but makes up for that by selling more iPods, which are extremely profitable. Microsoft, which analysts say loses money on each Xbox 360 it sells, expects to make up for that by selling games -- and now video. \"This is a razors-and-blades business,\" Mr. Moore said. \"I've taken the hit on the razor. And the ability of Microsoft to offer more blades gives consumers more choice and drives more revenue.\" The video downloads, especially those in high definition, will take up a lot of space. Microsoft says a one-hour television program in high definition will take up about 2 gigabytes of the console's standard 20-gigabyte hard drive. Microsoft says the Xbox will play both movies and TV shows as they are being downloaded, although with larger files there will be a delay before playback starts, in contrast to the video-on-demand services offered by cable companies. High-definition movies will take an especially long while, depending on the speed of the Internet connection. Editors' Note: November 10, 2006, Friday An article in Business Day on Tuesday described a decision by Microsoft to offer movies and episodes of television shows for downloading through its Xbox Live online service in the United States. The article quoted Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group, discussing the features that set Xbox Live service apart and its position in the market. But the article did not note that Mr. Enderle had Microsoft as a client, a fact later pointed out by a reader. Mr. Enderle does consulting work for several of Microsoft's product groups, though not for the one developing the Xbox; still, had The Times known of Mr. Enderle's work for Microsoft, it would not have sought out his opinion on the product."

                "TOKYO — Microsoft is expected to slash the price of its Xbox 360 game console in Japan by about 30 percent, below the price of Nintendo's Wii and Sony's PlayStation 3 as it tries to increase its market share, a newspaper reported Monday. Demand for the Xbox 360 has been tepid in Japan, mainly due to a lack of popular games. In contrast, the market-leading Wii is thriving on a range of innovative software, prompting Nintendo to raise its earning forecast Friday. Hiroshi Kamide, a KBC Securities analyst, said a price cut alone is unlikely to trigger a jump in demand for the Xbox 360 and Microsoft needs to focus more on producing attractive software. \"Popular software is now serving as a tail wind to Xbox sales,\" he said. \"Even if they slash the console price, that would not directly boost sales unless they release more good software.\" Robust demand for Namco Bandai's \"Tales of Vesperia\" role-playing game helped Xbox 360's Japanese sales in the week ended Aug. 10. beat the PlayStation 3 for the first time. Microsoft will lower the price of the Xbox 360 Arcade model by ¥8,000 to ¥19,800, or about $180, the Nikkei business daily said. The Arcade does not come equipped with a hard drive and is the least expensive of the three Xbox 360 models. The company has already cut the price in the United States, Europe and four Asian markets as it tries to grab a larger chunk of the $57 billion game industry. The new price will make that model cheaper than Nintendo's Wii, which sells for about ¥25,000 yen, and the PlayStation 3, which sells for ¥39,800. The Wii's success has been attributed to inventive titles like the \"Wii Fit\" exercise game, its low price and its easy-to-learn motion-sensing controller. Microsoft will also reduce the price of two more expensive models with hard drives by ¥5,000 to ¥8,000, the paper said. Kazumi Ishiyama, a Microsoft Xbox spokeswoman in Japan, declined to comment on the Nikkei report. The company is scheduled to hold a briefing on the Xbox 360 in the Japanese market Monday afternoon. In Europe, the Xbox 360 Arcade model already costs less than the Wii. The Xbox 360 has lagged its Japanese rivals on their home turf, with 684,695 units sold so far in Japan against Wii's 6.67 million and PlayStation 3's 2.32 million, according to the game magazine publisher Enterbrain. The Xbox 360 was introduced about a year before its rivals."

                "AFTER a 31-year-old Manhattan financial executive received Microsoft's Xbox video game system as a gift in January, he walked to a store and bought a half-dozen game titles. The video game industry would have been pleased to hear it. After he played those games a few times against computer-controlled opponents, he got a bit bored and signed up for Microsoft's Xbox Live service, which enabled him to play against other people online. The video game industry, again, would have been pleased. After a few months on the Xbox Live network, in May, he got a bit bored again. This time, however, he opened his Xbox and soldered in a chip that allowed him to change the console's basic computer code and bypass its internal security technology. After installing a new hard drive, he transferred about 3,000 MP3 music files to the system and downloaded illegal copies of 3,500 old-time arcade games. Then he installed the Linux operating system, which allowed him to use the box essentially as a personal computer. Needless to say, the video game industry would not have been pleased. When Microsoft released the Xbox in November 2001, it was heralded as far more than a game machine. Even as the Xbox took aim at Sony's PlayStation 2 game empire, the console was meant to lead Microsoft's broader invasion of the living room. Incorporating a hard drive, which made it more readily adaptable than other consoles, the Xbox had the potential to be a digital-entertainment nerve center. Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, said at the time, ''We're going to put new software that runs on Xbox that, both in the gaming dimension and other dimensions, will amaze people with the power that's in this box.'' That is happening, but not necessarily as Microsoft planned. All sorts of new software is indeed running on Xbox consoles these days, and they are in fact becoming home-entertainment hubs, but it is not Microsoft doing the amazing. Rather, an online confederacy apparently numbering in the thousands -- including accomplished hackers of varied motives and everyday technophiles like the Manhattan financial executive (who shared his experience on the condition of anonymity) -- is taking the lead. Those involved often call their efforts ''unleashing'' or ''unshackling'' -- freeing the Xbox to express its inner PC. Technology industry executives, however, often call such activity a bald attempt to hijack the Xbox illegally. It is a battle that involves many of the ethical and legal issues facing the technology and media industries at this digital moment. What rights do consumers have to tinker with products they own? How far should companies go to protect their intellectual property? What happens when the desires of consumers conflict with the business models of companies they patronize? Who gets to decide just what a particular product may be used for? The Xbox is a particularly attractive target for hackers because while it is essentially a standard PC modified to do only a few things, like play Xbox games, it is much cheaper than a PC. It is like an economy car modified to follow only a few roads -- but one potentially as powerful as a far more expensive model. In the Xbox, that power comes in the form of a 733-megahertz Intel processor, comparable to a midrange personal computer, and sophisticated graphics and audio systems. Its limited operating system, based on a version of Windows, can be used by a programmer to run simple software like a music player -- or the machine can run a new operating system altogether, namely Linux. ''The reality is that if you could bypass Microsoft's operating system you would end up with a fairly powerful computer for less than $200,'' the Manhattan financial executive said. In fact, Microsoft lowered the price for Xbox to $179.99 in May. In a sense, Xbox hackers are exploiting Microsoft's business model, which is to sell Xbox hardware at a loss (to build penetration of the system) and make the money back on royalties from the sale of Xbox software. A PC manufacturer like Dell, meanwhile, has to recoup its costs and generate a profit from the initial sale. So someone who buys the Xbox hardware, modifies it into a general-purpose computer and does not buy Xbox games potentially undermines not only Microsoft but also the personal computer industry. But that is not how some Xbox hackers think about it. ''Especially in Europe, computers are more expensive than they are here, and the Xbox is the cheapest computer you can get,'' Andrew Huang, author of a new book called ''Hacking the Xbox: An Introduction to Reverse Engineering,'' said in a telephone interview. ''Basically,'' he added by e-mail, ''once you have Linux, you have everything.'' It is unclear just how many Xbox hackers there are. Officials of the Interactive Digital Software Association, a trade group of video game publishers, said that Xbox hacking appeared more prevalent in parts of Asia than in North America. Michael Steil, a 24-year-old German who is project leader of a group that calls itself the Xbox Linux Project, said by e-mail that a full version of Linux software for the Xbox had been downloaded more than 220,000 times. Whatever the numbers, Microsoft does not appear eager to discuss Xbox hacking. In recent weeks, a Microsoft public relations representative repeatedly declined to make any company executives available to discuss the matter. Instead, the company issued a statement through a public relations firm that said in part: ''Microsoft is a company passionate about innovation and creativity. We are also very committed to respect for others' intellectual property and we request the same respect applied to our innovations.'' The statement made no reference to the potential use of hacked Xbox consoles as personal computers, saying Microsoft's ''primary concern'' was with the sale of modified chips for the boxes ''that enable game counterfeiting.'' And that is the area that most clearly raises legal issues. Although there are several methods, hacking an Xbox typically involves obtaining a special chip called a modchip, available on the Internet, and soldering it into the machine. (For those who find the process daunting, there are also vendors on the Internet who sell ''pre-modded'' Xbox units.) Modchips, of which there are several varieties, allow users to load new versions of the basic computer code, known as the BIOS, that tells the machine how to operate. A hacked BIOS generally incorporates modified versions of copyrighted Microsoft code and so is generally illegal. The main Web sites that deal with Xbox hacking do not include links to hacked BIOS, and hackers generally find their forbidden fruit in Internet chat rooms. Once the modchip is installed and the BIOS modified, the console can do a number of things it cannot do ''out of the box.'' Xbox games normally must be run from an optical disk, and a hacked Xbox can ''back up'' a game to the unit's hard drive and run the game without the disk. This technique could be used simply to avoid having to insert and remove disks -- or it could be used for piracy (say, by renting a game, putting the software on the hard drive and returning the game). Until passage of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act in 1998, the mere sale of a modified chip would not have appeared illegal. That law, however, prohibits the sale of devices that are primarily meant to circumvent copyright protection. Companies and technologists will fight over the exact legal meaning of those provisions for years. For now, however, the software industry is relying on them. ''Our view over all on modchips is that they are illegal infringing devices, that where we find people engaged in the widespread manufacturing and distribution of them, we and our members, individually and collectively, are committed to doing what we can to shut down their manufacturing and go after the distributors,'' said Doug Lowenstein, president of the Interactive Digital Software Association. Some advocates, however, say that while software piracy is illegal and morally offensive, the mere act of modifying hardware should not be illegal. ''The most important dimension of this debate from our view is that people should have the right to tinker with the stuff that they own,'' said Fred von Lohmann, senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a civil-liberties group in San Francisco. ''Others will say that this is about piracy and all that, but they forget that the principle of tinkering with the stuff that you own was the principle on which the entire personal computer industry was founded,'' he added. ''This is basic business and basic science in the technology world and we think that this right to tinker, this freedom to tinker, remains legally protected.'' For now, however, the federal government seems to agree with Mr. Lowenstein. Last December, David M. Rocci, a 22-year-old from Blacksburg, Va., pleaded guilty to a federal charge of conspiring to import, market and sell modchips for the Xbox. In April, he was sentenced to five months in prison and five months of home detention. Simply from the standpoint of accessibility, the PlayStation 2 would seem to be a more likely candidate for hacking. IDG, the technology research firm, estimates that at the end of last year, 38.1 million PlayStation 2 units were in use in Europe, North America and Japan combined, compared with 6.7 million Xbox units in those regions. In one sense, however, the hacking scene for PlayStation 2 is less developed than the one for Xbox because there is less appetite for it. Sony sells an official conversion kit for the PlayStation 2 that includes a hard drive and allows that system to run the Linux operating system, which in turn allows the system to run MP3's, movies, spreadsheets or any other program or data that works under Linux. It is relatively easy for Sony to embrace Linux because Sony, unlike Microsoft, is not in the operating system business. The PlayStation 2 hacking community seems focused on developing chips that allow PlayStation 2 units to run illegal copies of games and games meant for far-flung parts of the world. (For marketing reasons, many PlayStation 2 games include regional coding, much as DVD's do.) In 2001, Sony sued an Australian for selling modchips that allowed Australian PlayStation 2 units to play games from other parts of the world. After the Australian government argued on the man's behalf, however, the Federal Court of Australia last July ruled mostly against Sony. Mr. von Lohmann said that Microsoft had not been particularly aggressive in combating Xbox hackers but that Sony had actively fought them. A Sony spokeswoman did not respond this week to requests for comment about the company's approach to hackers. For its part, Microsoft, through its public relations agency, indicated that it believed Xbox hackers were a relatively small band. ''Aside from a set of hobbyists,'' it said, ''the vast majority of Xbox owners are not focused on this niche.'' But those who are appear quite focused indeed. By e-mail, Mr. Steil, the German leader of the Xbox Linux project, declared: ''In very simple words: The Xbox is cheaper than a PC. The Xbox is a lot smaller than a PC. The Xbox looks better (next to a TV set). The Xbox is more silent. Therefore it's an ideal Linux computer in the living room.'' That was probably not the vision Mr. Gates had in mind."

                "Users of Microsoft’s popular Xbox Kinect gaming console will soon be able to use voice and motion commands to interact with advertisements while they are playing their favorite game or watching a video. On Tuesday, Microsoft is set to announce a new suite of advertising tools, called NUads, short for natural user-interface ads, that will let users interact with advertising on the console dashboard or embedded in games and other video content. The ads use the same voice and motion control developed for the company’s Kinect game console, which it introduced in time for the 2010 holiday season.  The new ads are intended to help advertisers keep the attention of Xbox users in a way that traditional television advertising does not.  “When you have highly interactive people and a passive medium, they are interacting with their phone or their laptop while watching TV,” said Mark Kroese, the general manager of the advertising business group at Microsoft. The new ads, Mr. Kroese said, “create a natural way for the user to engage with the TV.”  At least one advertising agency seems to agree.  “The new ad units really epitomized the level of engagement that everyone is working towards,” said John M. Lisko, the executive communications director of Saatchi & Saatchi Los Angeles, part of the Publicis Groupe. Mr. Lisko said the agency had successfully advertised on the Xbox console in the past and was “absolutely considering” the new capabilities. “You can text, you can tweet, you can vote,” he said. “That’s phenomenal.”  Using voice commands, gamers will be able to send messages about an ad to a social networking site like Twitter by saying “Xbox Tweet.” Advertisers who want to send more information about a product or promotion associated with a campaign can prompt Xbox users to say “Xbox More,” which will send users an e-mail with the information they wanted.  For advertising tied to events like television shows, advertisers can prompt a user to say “Xbox Schedule” and the system will send a text message reminder to the user’s mobile phone. Similarly, advertisers can prompt users to say “Xbox Near Me” and a map to the nearest retailer will be sent to their mobile phone. Finally, advertisers can prompt users to vote on a topic by asking the user to wave their hand in front of the console and select their favorite pizza topping, superhero or clothing brand.  The new advertising options will be presented on Tuesday to advertisers at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, an annual conference for advertisers and marketers. Consumers will begin to see the new features in the spring of 2012.  The new ads will be simple for marketers to deploy since they can use the same commercials they would use on television.  “What we’re seeing now is a technology environment where marketers can deliver more sophisticated ads and they don’t have some of the hurdles that in-game marketers and in-game publishers had,” said Paul Verna, a senior analyst at eMarketer. “It’s a level of interactivity that suggests more possibilities than we’ve seen up until now.” "

                "The daughter of a Brazilian Catholic mother and a Palestinian Muslim father, Fatima Shama, 39, grew up in the Bronx, attending Roman Catholic school during the week, Muslim “Sunday school” on Saturdays and church on Sundays. She speaks six languages, which comes in handy for her job as the commissioner of the Mayor’s Office of Immigrant Affairs, a position she has held since 2009. (Recently, her office reached out to immigrant communities affected by Hurricane Sandy to help them navigate government resources and aid.) She lives in Turtle Bay in Manhattan with her husband, Ziad Mansouri, 42, who works at JPMorgan Chase, and their three sons, Samir, 8; Ibrahim, 5; and Omar, 2. She and her husband are raising them as Muslims, with a generous dose of other religious traditions. WAKE-UP CALL My kids tend to wake me up — that’s about 6:30, 7 o’clock. Coffee is absolutely essential. It’s almost the first thing I do. Then we get the Sunday Times. My youngest son loves to be the person to get it for me. INTERNATIONAL BREAKFAST It could be me deciding to make Belgian waffles or pancakes, or it’s possible I’ll make — my kids love an Arabic breakfast food called lebni — basically, strained yogurt, and you eat it with pita bread. And they love an Arabic string cheese and another kind of cheese common to the region called haloumi, a must to every breakfast table in our house OUTSIDE VOICES Sundays are absolutely about family and spending time with our kids. From 11 to 2 is our outside time. We might go ice skating at Wollman Rink, or the Central Park Zoo; we are there a lot and we love it. I think that the kids would probably say the Museum of Natural History is their favorite, just ‘cause of what we get to see. It’s everything from butterflies and frogs and lizards to the dinosaurs or the elephants. And they can be loud and we don’t have to apologize to anybody. Sometimes we’ll do excursions out of the city, or there might be a children’s birthday party or two, given our kids’ social lives. PARADER IN CHIEF If it’s summertime, there’s likely a parade that I might march in or a community event I might stop by. Of course, during the hurricane, every Sunday we were out in the community. But if it’s summertime, rest assured there’s a parade in my future. BOYS’ TIME Our kids are only allowed to play their electronics on the weekends. Our kids got an Xbox for Christmas — I grew up in a dual home, so my kids have the pleasure of learning about their own faith, but also being able to celebrate the faith of my siblings and mother. The Xbox Kinect Dance Central game, I will tell you that is hysterical. I actually love the fact that this Kinect thing helps them jump around. And Sunday football is a big deal. We’re a Giants home, but my sons love the Tampa Bay Buccaneers — their mascot is a pirate, so we think that’s how it started. My oldest son can tell you anything about football. SHOPPING, COOKING I try to cook for the week or make some Sunday dinner for us, so I might run to the supermarket. I love to cook with my kids. My middle son loves to make a Brazilian cheese bread, so we make that a lot. We make black beans and rice, there’s always a pasta night — I do make, actually, a lot of Arabic food. WINDING DOWN Then it’s dinner, bath time and we do reading every night. Our kids are in bed by about 8:30. And it’s my date with “Downton Abbey.” Lady Grantham, the grandmother, I just love her absolutely dry sarcasm and her love of the monarchy and all things traditional. And I try to clean out my e-mail before Monday morning, do what I can do to make life better before Monday morning. FINISHING UP This is actually a very true thing: I basically don’t go to sleep until I finish the paper so I can put it out into the recycling bin. Otherwise it becomes a pile. I actually try to finish all of my Sunday paper and I actually read the paper — Sunday in particular — minus a couple sections, cover to cover. I love holding the paper, but I love the ads. I like to look at the jewelry ads. Even though I could never buy any of it."

                "WASHINGTON — In late January, as China locked down some provinces to contain the spread of the coronavirus, average internet speeds in the country slowed as people who were stuck inside went online more and clogged the networks. In Hubei Province, the epicenter of infections, mobile broadband speeds fell by more than half. In mid-February, when the virus hit Italy, Germany and Spain, internet speeds in those countries also began to deteriorate. And last week, as a wave of stay-at-home orders rolled out across the United States, the average time it took to download videos, emails and documents increased as broadband speeds declined 4.9 percent from the previous week, according to Ookla, a broadband speed testing service. Median download speeds dropped 38 percent in San Jose, Calif., and 24 percent in New York, according to Broadband Now, a consumer broadband research site. Quarantines around the world have made people more reliant on the internet to communicate, work, learn and stay entertained. But as the use of YouTube, Netflix, Zoom videoconferencing, Facebook calls and videogaming has surged to new highs, the stress on internet infrastructure is starting to show in Europe and the United States — and the traffic is probably far from its peak. “This is totally unprecedented,” said Thierry Breton, a European Union commissioner who oversees digital policy and was a chief executive of France Télécom. “We have to be proactive.” To head off problems, European regulators like Mr. Breton have pushed streaming companies such as Netflix and YouTube to reduce the size of their video files so they don’t take up as much bandwidth. In the United States, regulators have given wireless carriers access to more spectrum to bolster the capacity of their networks. Some tech companies have responded to the call to ease internet traffic. YouTube, which is owned by Google, said this week that it would reduce the quality of its videos from high to standard definition across the globe. Disney delayed the start of its Disney Plus streaming service in France by two weeks, and Microsoft’s Xbox asked gaming companies to introduce online updates and new releases only at certain times to prevent network congestion. “We really don’t know how long we’re going to be in this mode for,” Dave Temkin, Netflix’s vice president of network and systems infrastructure, said in a webinar on Wednesday on how the coronavirus could affect internet infrastructure. Internet service providers like Comcast, Vodafone, Verizon and Telefónica have been building out their networks for years to account for increasing demand. But company officials said they had never seen such a steep, sudden surge. Growth that the industry had expected to take a year is happening over days, said Enrique Blanco, the chief technology officer at Telefónica, a Spanish telecommunications company. “In just two days we grew all the traffic we had planned for 2020,” Mr. Blanco said. On Monday, traffic on AT&T’s networks was up 27 percent compared to the same day last month, and last week Verizon experienced a 22 percent increase in traffic on its wireless and fiber broadband service. Wi-Fi calls doubled from their normal volume, the carriers said. In Europe, internet traffic into homes over fixed lines was up more than 30 percent, according to Telefónica. Activities like online gaming and video conferencing have more than doubled, while messages over WhatsApp have more than quadrupled. So much traffic and stress on internet networks has slowed the speed of downloading web pages and apps, according to Ookla. “Congestion is higher,” said Adriane Blum, an Ookla spokeswoman. “We’re all at home, and the activities we’re doing in this unprecedented time are not low-bandwidth usage, which means a lot of activity on a network.” Cisco said demand for its WebEx teleconference service had tracked the spread of the coronavirus. Demand first surged in Asia, then in Europe, and last week it soared 240 percent in the United States. The demand has pushed up failure rates delivering video conferencing, said Sri Srinivasan, a Cisco senior vice president in charge of WebEx. “I don’t know if we’ll soon see a peak, not for weeks to come,” he said. “The reason I say that is because we aren’t seeing traffic in Asia slow down even now.” Internet service providers said they could handle the deluge of traffic but were adding capacity. Verizon, Cox and AT&T said they were building more cell sites to strengthen mobile networks, increasing the number of fiber connections on their network backbones, and upgrading the routing and switching technology that lets devices talk to one another and share an internet connection. Orange, formerly France Télécom, has doubled its capacity inside undersea internet cables. In Italy, where home internet use is up 90 percent, Telecom Italia said its technicians continued to make repairs and add capacity. Vodafone, one of Europe’s largest networks operators, said it had increased its capacity 50 percent in recent weeks through a mix of software and the addition of more equipment in the field. “We’re seeing some signs of stress,” AT&T’s chief executive, Randall Stephenson, said in an interview on CNN on Sunday. “We’re having to go out and do some augmentation of networks, and so we’re sending our employees out there to get that done, but right now the network is performing quite well.” To prevent clogged networks, Europe has taken the most aggressive steps. Last week, Mr. Breton, the European Union commissioner, discussed reducing the bitstreams of videos with Reed Hastings, the chief executive of Netflix; Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Google; and Susan Wojcicki, the head of YouTube. The companies agreed, as did Amazon for its Prime Video streaming service and Twitch, its online gaming platform. Many of the companies then went further. On Tuesday, Netflix decided to switch its high-definition video streams in India, Australia and Latin America to slightly lower quality to reduce the traffic they create there by 25 percent, and YouTube said it would make all global streams standard definition. “We continue to work closely with governments and network operators around the globe to do our part to minimize stress on the system during this unprecedented situation,” YouTube said in a statement. Microsoft’s Xbox gaming business recently asked large gaming companies to release online updates of their games during off-peak hours while it helped focus on the critical internet needs of people involved in the coronavirus crisis, according to an Xbox email reviewed by The New York Times. Video game updates can require great amounts of bandwidth to download. Xbox asked the companies to release updates in a four-hour overnight window in North America, and only from Monday through Thursday. “Microsoft is actively monitoring performance and usage trends to ensure we’re optimizing service for our customers worldwide, and accommodating new growth and demand,” the company said. “At the same time, these are unprecedented times, and we’re also taking proactive steps to plan for these high-usage periods.” While U.S. regulators said they did not plan to follow Europe in asking for streaming and social media companies to degrade their services, they are taking other steps. Last week, the Federal Communications Commission granted Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile temporary access to more airwaves. “The F.C.C. has been coordinating closely with network operators to ensure those networks remain up and running,” Ajit Pai, the agency’s chairman, said in a statement. Telefónica’s Mr. Blanco, who has been living under a lockdown in Spain, said he expected the record traffic to last for some time. It may even become the new normal, he said. In Spain, internet use drops only at 8 p.m., when people across the country go to their windows to cheer health workers and others who are helping to manage the crisis. “Suddenly at 8 p.m. it goes down, then it goes back up,” Mr. Blanco said. “It’s a beautiful thing.” Cecilia Kang reported from Washington, Davey Alba from New York and Adam Satariano from London.

                "The last time I was unemployed was in the depths of the Great Recession. I had recently moved in with my girlfriend, who suddenly found herself with an out-of-work partner who rarely left the house. But she gave me some surprising advice: Play video games. I would have a lot of time on my hands, she said, and while I could and should certainly do other things — housework, exercise, searching for a job — I would mostly be stuck at home with limited resources. Without something to occupy my mind, I’d go crazy. She was right. Playing video games helped ease my mind, elevate my mood and possibly saved our relationship. This year we’ll celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary. So now I’m going to give the same advice to anyone who is now out of work, or otherwise kept at home: Play video games. And don’t feel bad about it. If you’re not a gamer, you might think of video games as simple time-wasters. But for those stuck mostly inside without work, killing time is a real problem. And in the world of big-budget console games, 10 to 15 hours is a fairly short experience. Some can take hundreds of hours to complete. There are online games designed to be played and replayed for thousands of hours. But games are more than just empty time-wasters. In periods of pain, boredom or personal emptiness, video games can serve as palliative care for both the body and the mind. Think of gaming as a personal stimulus plan for a nation of unexpected shut-ins: It’s not a long-term solution, it won’t work for everyone, and it won’t solve the underlying problems — but it can provide limited, temporary relief for some. Video games take many forms, but they are all essentially simulations. And when the real world is temporarily unavailable, a simulated version might be what we need. Among other things, video games simulate work: Even the simplest games give players tasks, objectives, lists of things they have to do, problems to solve and a sense of accomplishment upon completion. And the biggest modern games offer seemingly endless lists of quests and objectives, tasks and subtasks, systems to learn and skills to be mastered. A game like the online shooter Destiny 2 offers hundreds, if not thousands, of hours of play, exploration and study. Set in an intricately designed sci-fi world, it tasks players with taking out wave after wave of alien enemies. It also rewards them for understanding a complex character progression system that involves completing ever-more-difficult goals and objectives, sometimes multiple times, in exchange for rarer and more powerful weapons and armor. You might not actually accomplish anything after a day spent checking off quests and gathering virtual materials, but you’ll feel like you did. Game critics have noted the worklike nature of many modern games for years, not always favorably. But in a world of stay-at-home mass unemployment, even the illusion of accomplishment is probably better than none at all. Indeed, the particular shut-in nature of our current crisis makes video games unusually relevant in a different way: What video games do better than any other medium is simulate places. Open-world games like Skyrim, Red Dead Redemption II or The Witcher 3 are built around giant, explorable spaces, sometimes the virtual equivalent of hundreds of square miles, with elaborate geography and shifting weather. They can take days or weeks to fully explore and at their best can be unexpectedly beautiful, offering the opportunity to encounter animated versions of sun-dappled vistas or foggy mountain peaks, to wander through crowded city streets or stroll past others on well-trod footpaths. Games can give us someplace else to go. That makes games useful in another way. Some of us are shut in alone. But especially in cities, many are now effectively trapped inside modest apartments with family or roommates, and little private space. Games offer a form of personal escape, a way to simulate being elsewhere from the confines of your couch. And for those who are alone, games can also serve as social spaces, virtual fields of play for cooperative adventures or competitive contests. Many of today’s most popular games are online experiences that allow players to engage with friends as well as strangers, to forge digital versions of the same sort of bonds with teammates that can develop in the real world. If you’re new at this, the cost of entry is fairly low: There are thousands of high-quality games available for phones, and many more available to download directly to your computer. Even better, many big-budget games are free if you have a computer or game console on which to play them. Late last year, Destiny 2, released in 2017 as a full-priced game, reinvented itself as a free-to-play experience, with the base game available at no cost (players can pay for expansions). Several of the “battle royale” games that have defined the new wave of first-person shooters are also free: A relatively well-reviewed recent entry, Call of Duty: Warzone, offers several clever twists on the popular last-player-standing formula. Not everyone wants to play online shooters, but for those willing to spend a little there are now subscription services that offer access to a large library of games for an annual or monthly fee. For little more than the price of a standard Netflix plan, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate offers access to dozens of games, from moody, philosophical puzzle games like The Talos Principle to richly animated platformers like Ori and the Will of the Wisps. There are sports games, strategy games, role-playing games and simple twitchy diversions that recall the arcade games I pumped quarters into as a kid. And for those who not satisfied with our current quasi-apocalypse, there even games about viral outbreaks and attacks, from the strategic epidemic simulator Plague Inc., to the deftly scripted post-pandemic action game The Last of Us, to The Division 2, a military thriller set in emptied-out recreations of downtown Washington and New York after a viral bioweapon wipes out most of the population. Maybe that one hits a little too close to home. Yes, games are frivolous. Yes, they are escapist. But the longer the coronavirus keeps social life and culture in isolation, the more we’ll need frivolity and escapism. There’s a limit, of course, to what video games can do: They can’t serve as long-term substitutes for real places, real work or real human interaction. But they can give us a simulacrum of all those things at a time when the real ones are in short supply, and tide us over until the world we actually need returns.

            "text": [
                "Like many young hipsters in Austin, Tex., Michael Burns wanted to make it big in some creative field -- perhaps writing comedy scripts in Hollywood. Instead, he wound up in a dead-end job, managing a call center. To kill time, he made friends with a group of equally clever and bored young men at the company where he worked, and they'd sit around talking about their shared passion: video games. Their favorite title was Halo, a best-selling Xbox game in which players control armor-clad soldiers as they wander through gorgeous coastal forests and grim military bunkers and fight an army of lizardlike aliens. Burns and his gang especially loved the \"team versus team\" mode, which is like a digital version of paint ball: instead of fighting aliens, players hook their Xboxes to the Internet, then log on together in a single game, at which point they assemble into two teams -- red-armored soldiers versus blue-armored ones. Instead of shooting aliens, they try to slaughter one another, using grenades, machine guns and death rays. On evenings and weekends, Burns and his friends would cluster around their TV's until the wee hours of the morning, gleefully blowing one another to pieces. \"Halo is like crack,\" Burns recalls thinking. \"I could play it until I die.\" Whenever a friend discovered a particularly cool stunt inside Halo -- for example, obliterating an enemy with a new type of grenade toss -- Burns would record a video of the stunt for posterity. (His friend would perform the move after Burns had run a video cord from his TV to his computer, so he could save it onto his hard drive.) Then he'd post the video on a Web site to show other gamers how the trick was done. To make the videos funnier, sometimes Burns would pull out a microphone and record a comedic voice-over, using video-editing software to make it appear as if the helmeted soldier himself were doing the talking. Then one day he realized that the videos he was making were essentially computer-animated movies, almost like miniature emulations of \"Finding Nemo\" or \"The Incredibles.\" He was using the game to function like a personal Pixar studio. He wondered: Could he use it to create an actual movie or TV series? Burns's group decided to give it a shot. They gathered around the Xbox at Burns's apartment, manipulating their soldiers like tiny virtual actors, bobbing their heads to look as if they were deep in conversation. Burns wrote sharp, sardonic scripts for them to perform. He created a comedy series called \"Red vs. Blue,\" a sort of sci-fi version of \"M*A*S*H.\" In \"Red vs. Blue,\" the soldiers rarely do any fighting; they just stand around insulting one another and musing over the absurdities of war, sounding less like patriotic warriors than like bored, clever video-store clerks. The first 10-minute episode opened with a scene set in Halo's bleakest desert canyon. Two red soldiers stood on their base, peering at two blue soldiers far off in the distance, and traded quips that sounded almost like a slacker disquisition on Iraq: Red Soldier: \"Why are we out here? Far as I can tell, it's just a box canyon in the middle of nowhere, with no way in or out. And the only reason we set up a red base here is because they have a blue base there. And the only reason they have a blue base over there is because we have a red base here.\" When they were done, they posted the episode on their Web site (surreptitiously hosted on computers at work). They figured maybe a few hundred people would see it and get a chuckle or two. Instead, \"Red vs. Blue\" became an instant runaway hit on geek blogs, and within a single day, 20,000 people stampeded to the Web site to download the file. The avalanche of traffic crashed the company server. \"My boss came into the office and was like, 'What the hell is going on?' \" Burns recalls. \"I looked over at the server, and it was going blink, blink, blink.\" Thrilled, Burns and his crew quickly cranked out another video, then another. They kept up a weekly production schedule, and after a few months, \"Red vs. Blue\" had, like some dystopian version of \"Friends,\" become a piece of appointment viewing. Nearly a million people were downloading each episode every Friday, writing mash notes to the creators and asking if they could buy a DVD of the collected episodes. Mainstream media picked up on the phenomenon. The Village Voice described it as \" 'Clerks' meets 'Star Wars,' \" and the BBC called it \"riotously funny\" and said it was \"reminiscent of the anarchic energy of 'South Park.' \" Burns realized something strange was going on. He and his crew had created a hit comedy show -- entirely inside a video game. Video games have not enjoyed good publicity lately. Hillary Clinton has been denouncing the violence in titles like Grand Theft Auto, which was yanked out of many stores last month amid news that players had unlocked sex scenes hidden inside. Yet when they're not bemoaning the virtual bloodshed, cultural pundits grudgingly admit that today's games have become impressively cinematic. It's not merely that the graphics are so good: the camera angles inside the games borrow literally from the visual language of film. When you're playing Halo and look up at the sun, you'll see a little \"lens flare,\" as if you were viewing the whole experience through the eyepiece of a 16-millimeter Arriflex. By using the game to actually make cinema, Burns and his crew flipped a switch that neatly closed a self-referential media loop: movies begat games that begat movies. And Burns and his crew aren't alone. Video-game aficionados have been creating \"machinima\" -- an ungainly term mixing \"machine\" and \"cinema\" and pronounced ma-SHEEN-i-ma -- since the late 90's. \"Red vs. Blue\" is the first to break out of the underground, and now corporations like Volvo are hiring machinima artists to make short promotional films, while MTV, Spike TV and the Independent Film Channel are running comedy shorts and music videos produced inside games. By last spring, Burns and his friends were making so much money from \"Red vs. Blue\" that they left their jobs and founded Rooster Teeth Productions. Now they produce machinima full time. It may be the most unlikely form of indie filmmaking yet -- and one of the most weirdly democratic. \"It's like 'The Blair Witch Project' all over again, except you don't even need a camera,\" says Julie Kanarowski, a product manager with Electronic Arts, the nation's largest video-game publisher. \"You don't even need actors.\" Back in college, Burns and another Rooster Teeth founder, Matt Hullum, wrote and produced a traditional live-action indie movie. It cost $9,000, required a full year to make and was seen by virtually no one. By contrast, the four Xboxes needed to make \"Red vs. Blue\" cost a mere $600. Each 10-minute episode requires a single day to perform and edit and is viewed by hordes of feverish video-game fans the planet over. More than just a cheap way to make an animated movie, machinima allows game players to comment directly on the pop culture they so devotedly consume. Much like \"fan fiction\" (homespun tales featuring popular TV characters) or \"mash-ups\" (music fans blending two songs to create a new hybrid), machinima is a fan-created art form. It's what you get when gamers stop blasting aliens for a second and start messing with the narrative. And God knows, there's plenty to mess with. These days, the worlds inside games are so huge and open-ended that gamers can roam anywhere they wish. Indeed, players often abandon the official goal of the game -- save the princess; vanquish the eldritch forces of evil -- in favor of merely using the virtual environment as a gigantic jungle gym. In one popular piece of Halo machinima, \"Warthog Jump,\" a player cunningly used the game to conduct a series of dazzling physics experiments. He placed grenades in precise locations beneath jeeps and troops, such that when the targets blew sky-high, they pinwheeled through the air in precise formations, like synchronized divers. Another gamer recorded a machinima movie that poked subversive fun at Grand Theft Auto. Instead of playing as a dangerous, cop-killing gangster, the player pretended he was a naïve Canadian tourist -- putting down his gun, dressing in tacky clothes and simply wandering around the game's downtown environment for hours, admiring the scenery. So what's it like to actually shoot a movie inside a game? In June, I visited the Rooster Teeth offices in Buda, Tex., a tiny Austin suburb, to observe Burns and his group as they produced a scene of \"Red vs. Blue.\" Burns, a tall, burly 32-year-old, sat in front of two huge flat-panel screens, preparing the editing software. Nearby were the two Rooster Teeth producers who would be acting on-screen: Geoff Ramsey, a scraggly-bearded 30-year-old whose arms are completely covered in tattoos of fish and skulls, and Gustavo Sorola, a gangly 27-year-old who sprawled in a beanbag chair and peered through his thick architect glasses at the day's e-mail. They were fan letters, Sorola told me, that pour in from teenagers who are as enthusiastic as they are incoherent. \"The way kids write these days,\" he said with a grimace. \"It's like someone threw up on the keyboard.\" In the script they were acting out that day, a pair of \"Red vs. Blue\" soldiers engaged in one of their typically pointless existential arguments, bickering over whether it's possible to kill someone with a toy replica of a real weapon. The Rooster Teeth crew recorded the voice-overs earlier in the day; now they were going to create the animation for the scene. Burns picked up a controller and booted up Halo on an Xbox. He would act as the camera: whatever his character saw would be recorded, from his point of view. Then Sorola and Ramsey logged into the game, teleporting in as an orange-suited and a red-suited soldier. Burns posed them near a massive concrete bunker and frowned as he scrutinized the view on the computer screen. \"Hmmmm,\" he muttered. \"We need something to frame you guys -- some sort of prop.\" He ran his character over to a nearby alien hovercraft, jumped in and parked it next to the actors. \"Sweet!\" he said. \"I like it!\" In a \"Red vs. Blue\" shoot, the actors all must follow one important rule: Be careful not to accidentally kill another actor. \"Sometimes you'll drop your controller and it unintentionally launches a grenade. It takes, like, 20 minutes for the blood splatters to dry up,\" Ramsey said. \"Totally ruins the scene.\" Finally, Burns was ready to go. He shouted, \"Action!\" and the voice-overs began playing over loudspeakers. Sorola and Ramsey acted in time with the dialogue. Acting, in this context, was weirdly minimalist. They mashed the controller joysticks with their thumbs, bobbing the soldiers' heads back and forth roughly in time with important words in each line. \"It's puppetry, basically,\" Ramsey said, as he jiggled his controller. Of all the \"Red vs. Blue\" crew members, Ramsey is renowned for his dexterity with an Xbox. When a scene calls for more than five actors onstage, he'll put another controller on the ground and manipulate it with his right foot, allowing him to perform as two characters simultaneously. As I watched, I was reminded of what initially cracked me up so much about \"Red vs. Blue\": the idea that faceless, anonymous soldiers in a video game have interior lives. It's a \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern\" conceit; \"Red vs. Blue\" is what the game characters talk about when we're not around to play with them. As it turns out, they're a bunch of neurotics straight out of \"Seinfeld.\" One recruit reveals that he chain-smokes inside his airtight armor; a sergeant tells a soldier his battle instructions are to \"scream like a woman.\" And, in a sardonic gloss on the game's endless carnage, none of the soldiers have the vaguest clue why they're fighting. Yet as I discovered, real-life soldiers are among the most ardent fans of \"Red vs. Blue.\" When I walked around the Rooster Teeth office, I found it was festooned with letters, plaques and an enormous American flag, gifts from grateful American troops, many of whom are currently stationed in Iraq. Isn't it a little astonishing, I asked Burns when the crew went out in the baking Texas sun for a break, that actual soldiers are so enamored of a show that portrays troops as inept cowards, leaders as cynical sociopaths and war itself as a supremely meaningless endeavor? Burns laughed, but said the appeal was nothing sinister. \" 'Red vs. Blue' is about downtime,\" he said. \"There's very little action, which is precisely the way things are in real life.\" \"He's right,\" Ramsey added. He himself spent five years in the army after high school. \"We'd just sit around digging ditches and threatening to kill each other all day long,\" he said. \"We were bored out of our minds.\" Perhaps the most unusual thing about machinima is that none of its creators are in jail. After all, they're gleefully plundering intellectual property at a time when the copyright wars have become particularly vicious. Yet video-game companies have been upbeat -- even exuberant -- about the legions of teenagers and artists pillaging their games. This is particularly bewildering in the case of \"Red vs. Blue,\" because Halo is made by Bungie, a subsidiary of Microsoft, a company no stranger to using a courtroom to defend its goods. What the heck is going on? As it turns out, people at Bungie love \"Red vs. Blue.\" \"We thought it was kind of brilliant,\" says Brian Jarrard, the Bungie staff member who manages interactions with fans. \"There are people out there who would never have heard about Halo without 'Red vs. Blue.' It's getting an audience outside the hardcore gaming crowd.\" Sure, Rooster Teeth ripped off Microsoft's intellectual property. But Microsoft got something in return: \"Red vs. Blue\" gave the game a whiff of countercultural coolness, the sort of grass-roots street cred that major corporations desperately crave but can never manufacture. After talking with Rooster Teeth, Microsoft agreed, remarkably, to let them use the game without paying any licensing fees at all. In fact, the company later hired Rooster Teeth to produce \"Red vs. Blue\" videos to play as advertisements in game stores. Microsoft has been so strangely solicitous that when it was developing the sequel to Halo last year, the designers actually inserted a special command -- a joystick button that makes a soldier lower his weapon -- designed solely to make it easier for Rooster Teeth to do dialogue. \"If you're playing the game, there's no reason to lower your weapon at all,\" Burns explained. \"They put that in literally just so we can shoot machinima.\" Other game companies have gone even further. Many now include editing software with their games, specifically to encourage fans to shoot movies. When Valve software released its hit game Half-Life 2 last year, it included \"Faceposer\" software so that machinima creators could tweak the facial expressions of characters. When the Sims 2 -- a sequel to the top-selling game of all time -- came out last year, its publisher, Electronic Arts, set up a Web site so that fans could upload their Sims 2 movies to show to the world. (About 8,000 people so far have done so.) Still, it's one thing for gamers to produce a jokey comedy or a music video. Can machinima actually produce a work of art -- something with serious emotional depth? A few people have tried. In China, a visual artist named Feng Mengbo used the first-person-shooter game Quake III to produce Q4U, in which the screen is filled with multiple versions of himself, killing one another. Players' relationships with constant, blood-splattering violence is a common subject in game art. Last year, the 31-year-old artist Brody Condon produced an unsettling film that consisted of nothing but shots of himself committing suicide inside 50 different video games. \"I try to come to terms with what taking your life means in these games,\" Condon says. \"I'm trying to understand, spiritually, your relationship with an avatar on the screen.\" But even machinima's biggest fans admit that the vast majority of machinima is pretty amateurish. \"It's like if some friends of mine all broke into a movie set, and we all got to use all the cameras and special-effects equipment,\" says Carl Goodman, director of digital media at the American Museum of the Moving Image, which began to hold an annual machinima festival two years ago. \"We wouldn't quite know how to use it, but we'd make some pretty interesting stuff.\" Yet as Goodman points out, there's a competing proposition. Machinima does not always strive to emulate \"realistic,\" artistic movies. On the contrary, it is often explicitly devoted to celebrating the aesthetics of games -- the animations and in-jokes, the precise physics. Most machinima is probably meaningless to people who don't play games, much as ESPN is opaque to anyone who doesn't watch sports. But for those who do play Halo, it was genuinely thrilling to see something like \"Warthog Jump,\" with its meticulously synchronized explosions. The Rooster Teeth crew has its own hilariously stringent rule for making machinima: no cheating. When they shoot \"Red vs. Blue,\" they do not use any special effects that are not organically included in the game; everything you see in an episode of \"Red vs. Blue\" could in theory have taken place during an actual game of Halo, played by a fan in his bedroom. It's a charmingly purist attitude, a sci-fi version of the \"Dogma\" school of indie film, which argues that movies are best when cinematic trickery is kept to a minimum. One evening in New York, I visited with Ethan Vogt as he and his machinima team shot a car-chase scene for a Volvo promo. Vogt and two producers sat at computers, logged into a multiplayer game; each producer controlled a car racing through crowded city streets, while Vogt controlled a free-floating \"camera\" that followed behind, recording the visuals. The vehicles -- an enormous 1972 Chevy Impala and a Volvo V50 -- screamed along at about 60 miles an hour, fishtailing through corners while plowing into mailboxes, lampposts and, occasionally, clots of pedestrians. The lead car burst into flames. \"That's great,\" Vogt said. \"That's great.\" Though it shares with independent filmmaking a do-it-yourself aesthetic, machinima inverts the central tradition of indie film: smallness. With their skimpy budgets, indie directors tend to set movies in kitchens or living rooms -- and focus instead on providing quality acting and scripts. Machinima, in contrast, often has horribly cheesy acting and ham-fisted, purple-prose stories -- but they're set in outer space. Want massive shootouts? Howling mob scenes? Roman gladiatorial armies clashing by night? No problem. It is the rare form of amateur film in which the directors aspire to be not Wes Anderson but George Lucas. Indeed, with video games played on computers, it is now possible to build an entire world from scratch. The core of any video game is its game engine, the software that knows how to render 3-D objects and how to realistically represent the physics of how they move, bounce or collide. But the actual objects inside the game -- the people, the cars, the guns, even the buildings -- can be altered, tweaked or replaced by modifications, or \"mods.\" Mods do not require any deep programming skills; indeed, almost any teenager with a passing acquaintance in graphic-design software can \"re-skin\" a character in a game to make it look like himself, for instance. (Xbox and PlayStation games, in comparison, are much harder to mod, because the consoles are locked boxes, designed to prevent players from tampering with the games.) I was able to see modding in action one night when I visited the ILL Clan, a pioneering machinima group. Their headquarters are the kitchen table in the cramped one-bedroom Brooklyn apartment of Frank Dellario; a lanky, hyperkinetic 42-year-old, he sat on a rickety folding chair, pecking at a keyboard. The table was littered with four computer screens and laptops, the remnants of take-out sushi and a hopelessly tangled morass of computer cords and joysticks; a huge wide-screen TV lurked behind them for viewing their work. On the night I visited, they were using a game engine called Torque to shoot a short heist movie for Audi, in which two thugs beat up a concert violinist and make off with an antique violin in a van. To quickly create a gritty-looking city, Dellario and his colleague -- ILL Clan's co-founder, Matt Dominianni -- hired a local artist to build a generic-looking urban intersection inside the game. To customize it, Dominianni went onto Google, found snapshots of a few seedy stores (an adult bookstore, a tattoo parlor and a furniture outlet) and digitally pasted them onto the front of the buildings. Then they went to a site called Turbo-Squid, a sort of Amazon for virtual in-game items, and for $45 bought a van that could be plunked down inside the game. When I arrived, they were browsing the site and contemplating buying a few women. \"My God, look at this one,\" Dellario marveled, as he clicked open a picture of an eerily realistic 3-D brunette named Masha. \"I'm going to marry this woman. They've finally broken through to total reality.\" Dellario put the van into the correct location in the scene, then logged into the game to figure out the camera angle for this shot. He frowned. It didn't look right. The lighting was all off, with shadows falling in the wrong places. Dominianni figured out the problem: \"The sun is supposed to be at high noon. It's in the wrong place.\" \"Oh, yeah,\" Dellario said. \"Let me move it.\" He pulled up a menu, clicked on the \"sun\" command, and dragged it across the sky. Now they were finally ready to shoot. Dellario realized they needed an extra pair of hands to manipulate one of the thugs. \"Want to act in this scene?\" Dellario asked, and he handed me a joystick. I sat down at one of the computers and took control of \"Thug1,\" a brown-haired man in a golf shirt and brown pants, carrying the stolen violin. Dominianni was playing \"Thug2.\" Our characters were supposed to look around to make sure the coast is clear, then jump in the truck and race off. Dellario gave me my motivation: \"It's like you hear a suspicious noise. You're nervous.\" I used the joystick to practice moving my virtual character, craning its neck -- my neck? -- back and forth. I have played plenty of video games, but this felt awfully odd. Usually when I am inside a game, I'm just worried about staying alive while the bullets whiz past my ears. I've never had to emote. While Dellario and Dominianni fiddled with the camera angle, I grew impatient and wandered around, exploring the virtual set. I peered in a few shop windows -- they were strikingly photorealistic, even up close. Then I walked down an alley and suddenly arrived at the end of the set. It was like a tiny Western town in the desert: once you got beyond the few clustered buildings, there was nothing there -- just a vast, enormous plain, utterly empty and stretching off infinitely into the distance. This spring, electronic arts decided to promote the Sims 2 by hiring Rooster Teeth to create a machinima show using the game. Called \"The Strangerhood,\" it would be freely available online. \"The Strangerhood\" is a parody of reality TV: a group of people wake up one day to discover that they are living in new houses, and they can't remember who they are or how they got there. In the Sims 2, the animated people are impressively Pixar-like and expressive, making \"The Strangerhood\" even more like a mainstream animated show than \"Red vs. Blue\"; you could almost imagine watching it on Saturday morning. The problem is, the Sims 2 has turned out to be incredibly difficult to shoot with. When the Rooster Teeth gang uses Halo for machinima, the characters are mere puppets and can be posed any way the creators want. But in the Sims 2, the little virtual characters have artificial intelligence and free will. When you're playing, you do not control all the action: the fun is in putting your Sims in interesting social situations, then standing back and watching what they'll do. When Rooster Teeth's Matt Hullum builds a virtual set and puts the \"Strangerhood\" characters in place for a shoot, he's never quite sure what will happen. To shoot a scene in which two men wake up in bed together, Hullum had to spend hours playing with the two characters -- who are nominally heterosexual -- forcing them into repeated conversations until they eventually became such good friends they were willing to share a bed. Shooting machinima with Sims is thus maddeningly like using actual, human stars: they're stubborn; they stage hissy fits and stomp off to their trailers. \"We'll do three or four takes of a scene, and one of the Sims will start getting tired and want to go to sleep,\" Hullum said. \"It's just like being on a real set. You're screaming: 'Quick, quick, get the shot! We're losing light!' \" Hullum showed me a typical \"Strangerhood\" scene. He put Nikki, a young ponytailed brunette in a baseball cap, in the kitchen to interact with Wade, a slacker who looked eerily like a digital Owen Wilson. (To give Wade a mellow, San Francisco vibe, Hullum programmed him to move at a pace 50 percent slower than the other characters.) Hullum pointed to Nikki's \"mood\" bar; it was low, which meant she was in a bad mood and wouldn't want to talk. \"When they're bored, you have to lock them in a room alone for a few hours until they start to crave conversation,\" Hullum said. He tried anyway, prodding Wade to approach her and talk about food, one of Nikki's favorite subjects. It worked. The two became engrossed in a conversation, laughing and gesticulating wildly. \"See, this footage would be great if we were shooting a scene where these guys are maybe gossiping,\" Hullum mused, as he zoomed the camera in to frame a close-up on Wade. Then Nikki started to yawn. \"Oh, damn. See -- she's getting bored. Oh, no, she's walking away,\" Hullum said, as the little virtual Nikki wandered out of the room. \"Damn. You see what we have to deal with?\" The audience for \"The Strangerhood\" has not exploded the way \"Red vs. Blue\" did. The project is a gamble: its creators hope it will break out of machinima's geeky subculture and vault into the mainstream. Though in a way, Hullum said, the mainstream isn't always a fun place to be, either. Before he returned to Austin to work on \"Red vs. Blue,\" he spent six miserable years in Hollywood working on second-rate teen movies with big budgets, like \"Scooby-Doo\" and \"The Faculty.\" \"So now to come to this, where we have total creative control of our own stuff, it's amazing,\" Hullum said, as he watched Nikki walk out of the house in search of a more interesting conversation. \"I just pray we can keep this going. Because if we can't, I'm in big trouble.\" Clive Thompson is a contributing writer for the magazine."

                "SYNTHETIC WORLDS The Business and Culture of Online Games. By Edward Castronova. 332 pp. University of Chicago Press. $29. SMARTBOMB The Quest for Art, Entertainment and Big Bucks in the Videogame Revolution. By Heather Chaplin and Aaron Ruby. 287 pp. Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill. $24.95. Here's a theory that may be neither original nor empirically defensible but feels true: The more fun an activity is, the less interesting it is to read about. War producces great journalism; water-skiing does not. Can you guess where video games fall on this spectrum? In the last few years, a great many words have been expended to report on this flourishing cultural phenomenon. Most accounts begin with a hyperactive presentation of statistics, which we will not rehearse here. This is all you need to know (and perhaps already do): Video games have grown into a huge business, outpacing the movie industry and bulldozing childhood as we knew it. We adults are not safe, either. Whether they admit it or not, you probably have friends who can be found awake at 2 a.m. disemboweling orcs, foiling terrorist plots and scooping up fumbles and running them into end zones. It is the opinion of Edward Castronova, author of \"Synthetic Worlds,\" that such electronic experiences are not merely a hedge against boredom but a profound indicator of where the entire world is heading. Online, off-line; reality, fantasy -- these distinctions will cease to matter as more and more of us pass our time in virtual environments. Economies will evolve as we pay real money for virtual goods and vice versa. Conflicts that begin online will spill into the real world and back. Laws will be written to protect our newfound interests. Castronova's vision has elements of both utopia and dystopia. But mostly he is bullish. Life in these alternative zones may eventually become so fulfilling, he contends, \"that a fairly substantial exodus may loom in the distance.\" He means this, really. Like the Irish and Italians who left their native lands in the late 19th century to come to America, gamers could create a genuine human migration, away from the real and into the virtual. What will be real then? The specific object of Castronova's scholarship is Mmorpgs, the inelegant acronym for \"massively multiplayer online role-playing games,\" which can involve hundreds of thousands of players plugging in from all over the world. A disproportionate number of these games revolve around dwarfs, wizards, quests and magic lands, though the content is becoming ever more diverse. These days, there's a Mmorpg out there to suit the interests of just about anybody. One game, The Sims Online, merely simulates suburban life, and it is madly popular. Castronova is an economist who teaches telecommunications at Indiana University, and among academic economists he is a bold contrarian, if only because he dares to take computer games seriously. My oh my does he take them seriously. In dense, lifeless prose, he sledgehammers away at his major themes, constantly pausing to review the material he's just covered and preview what is to come. His sweeping conclusions are intriguing -- get ready for governments sending agents into virtual worlds and waging war with avatars! -- but he's not a vivid enough writer to animate most of his futuristic abstractions. In \"Smartbomb,\" Heather Chaplin and Aaron Ruby try harder to entertain. They've organized their history of video games as a study of ambitious individuals, breaking it down into a series of breezy, magazinelike profiles of uneven quality. A lot of the original reporting seems to take place at gaming conventions, which is not where one imagines the really interesting stuff happens. But the stories are pretty good, even when they don't break new ground. Rereading the legend of Nolan Bushnell and the founding of Atari is like hearing a bar band play a spirited \"Twist and Shout\" -- enjoyable, but no additional points for Degree of Difficulty. In two spots, though, Chaplin and Ruby really score. In their chapter on Mmorpgs, they sensitively profile David Reber, a 30-year-old Californian who spends every free moment chained to his computer, acting out a series of intense fantasy existences that provide him with the companionship and sense of achievement missing in his real life. Just as Castronova would predict, Reber withdraws from the real world as his fantasy life deepens -- he has lapses at work and when Chaplin and Ruby last check in with him, he's moved back in with his mother. The other winning portrait in \"Smartbomb\" is of Will Wright, the creator of SimCity, as well as its offshoot The Sims, and a new simulation called Spore in which players guide a new creature from its biological origin onward. In an industry that mimics Hollywood's craven predilection for cheap, gory theatrics, Wright stands apart as a humble philosopher in love with the potential of games to expand the human experience. Though Chaplin and Ruby don't have much to say themselves about the significance of video games, they wisely hand matters over to Wright, who foresees a future that might just keep us all staying up past 2 a.m. \"I think one thing that's unique about video games is not only that they can respond to you but down the road they'll be able to adapt themselves to you. They'll learn your desires,\" he says. \"It might just be that games become deeply personal artifacts -- more like dreams.\" Video Game Books Hugo Lindgren is the editorial director of New York Magazine."

                "THE great thing about shopping for video games is that the person you're buying the gift for almost certainly knows more about it than you do. If you have gamers in your life, no matter what age, odds are that they already know exactly what they want. You need only shut up and fork over the credit card. You can use this to your advantage. If you are lucky enough that the gamer on your list has said anything recently about a game or game machine that is not Microsoft's new Xbox 360, the smart move is to drop whatever you're doing right now and buy it. That way, you will not be among the hordes this holiday season already wondering if they can afford to miss a car payment, or maybe a mortgage installment, to satisfy their 360-craving gamer. That is because the 360, with its snazzy graphics and slick online interface, has emerged as the It gift of the 2005 holiday season. Theoretically, the 360 is supposed to cost $300 for a basic unit and $400 for the deluxe version. In reality, the console is sold out across the country and is now fetching $1,000 or so on eBay. And that's before you buy any games, which run up to $60 each. So if your favorite gamer is interested in anything else this year, consider yourself fortunate. Thankfully, forgoing the 360 doesn't mean returning to the Stone Age of, say, Pong. There are still excellent games being made for the current generation of home game consoles -- Sony's PlayStation 2, Nintendo's GameCube, and the original Xbox, which each cost less than $200 -- and Sony's $250 PSP headlines the strong current crop of hand-held units. Moreover, if you have a powerful PC, that may still be your most capable game machine. In any case, both Sony and Nintendo have new game consoles on the way next year. And availability of the 360 is sure to improve in early 2006. There is a chance that Microsoft could show up with a \"surprise\" boatload of additional 360's in the next few weeks. (The word from the company is that it is working as hard as it can to get units to retailers.) Unless you're willing to pay the prices on eBay or other auction sites, the best advice to shoppers who absolutely must have a 360 is to get themselves on waiting lists at as many retailers and Web sites as possible. So those folks you saw camped out on sidewalks before the 360 went on sale on Nov. 22 don't look so silly now, right? Waiting in line for a midnight sale at a Wal-Mart in Moline, Ill., Kara Harvell told The Quad-City Times that she wanted to buy the console for her five sons. Deliciously, the newspaper reported that Ms. Harvell, a nursing school student, \"got out of class by telling her professor that her son wasn't feeling well at school.\" Of course, some people don't like waiting in line. In the (very) few days before the machine sold out, scattered reports emerged of shoppers being held up for their 360's as they left stores. Please don't go robbing anyone. But if you've already gone through the effort of finding a 360 at its regular price, it is certainly worth the extra $100 for the higher-end model. The full version comes with a headset (for making free phone calls over the Internet to other Xbox users), a wireless controller (instead of a wired model) and a hard drive, which you need to play games made for the original Xbox. Top-line games are $50 to $60. The unit comes with a free basic membership to Microsoft's online game service, which lets you talk to other online 360 users and compare scores. But if you want to actually play head-to-head live over the Internet, you need to buy the \"gold\" membership, which costs $8 a month or $50 a year. In addition to playing games with eye-popping graphics, the machine plays DVD's and can display photos from your digital camera on your regular or high-definition television. Luckily, the 360 is not the only game system potentially worth buying this holiday season. There are cheaper and more readily available options, too. Besides the Xbox 360, the other major new game machine is Sony's PSP hand-held. The sleek black unit has a clear, colorful screen that is far more vibrant than one would expect from a hand-held device, and that may be why people on buses and trains seem to be using their PSP's to watch movies as much as playing games. Dozens of movies are now being released on the small UMD data discs that slip into the back of the PSP, which inexplicably comes with white headphones reminiscent of those supplied with Apple's iPods. Over all, the games for the PSP have been lackluster so far, but that trend shows signs of changing. Aimed at adults, the new Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories takes advantage of the PSP's built-in wireless capability to allow multiple PSP users to battle one another through the game's streets and alleys, even as the players themselves are on the go. Next year, a new installment of the quirky family-friendly Japanese game Katamari Damacy is expected for the PSP. Even cheaper and smaller than the PSP is Nintendo's DS hand-held, which costs about $130. Nintendo has long been popular with young gamers, but the new Nintendogs pet simulator is finding fans among both children and adult women. The screens on the DS, which stands for dual screen, are not quite as impressive as the PSP's, but are still clear enough for enjoyable gaming. But rather than play on the go, many people still prefer their video games on the television in the den. With all of the hype around the 360 it is easy to overlook that you can now buy the original Xbox or Sony's PlayStation 2 each for around $150. Bundles that include a console and a few games can be found under $300 on the Web. Nintendo's GameCube console now costs only around $100. Of course, the Xbox, GameCube and PS2 certainly don't have the cachet of the new 360. And most serious gamers already have one, two or even all three of the older systems. But if you are looking for a cost-effective way to introduce a young person to gaming, buying any of the older systems is a smart move. In fact, many serious gamers would argue that the games being made now for those mature machines are actually better than those for the 360, which is still so new that developers have not yet figured out how to fully harness its power. The older games just don't look quite as snazzy. But until Sony's PlayStation 3 and Nintendo's Revolution are released next year, the Xbox 360 is clearly the best gaming machine around (unless you want to consider a top-notch gaming PC, which could easily cost more than $2,000). If someone you know wants a 360 and you can't find it at a reasonable price, perhaps fend them off with a PSP or a gift certificate that can be exchanged for some new games for an existing console. Then promise you'll get a 360, PlayStation 3 or Revolution next year. You may forget the promise, but they won't. Is It Live, or Is It A Video Game? THERE are about 20 games available for Microsoft's new Xbox 360. It does not have a single hit title yet, as Halo became for the original Xbox, and the lineup is still missing some genres, like role-playing games. Nonetheless, games out now do a good job of demonstrating how the next generation of consoles deliver visual and social experiences far more sophisticated than those possible on older consoles. The strongest two genres on the 360 are auto racing and first-person shooters. On the racetrack, Project Gotham Racing 3 lets you speed through detailed recreated cities like New York, Las Vegas and London. You can race in online leagues, compete against \"ghosts\" that simulate your friends' best performances or \"tune in\" and watch from the sidelines as some of the best virtual drivers in the world go wheel to wheel. The shooters put a player in the perspective of a person fighting, often with guns. Among the standouts are Perfect Dark Zero, set in the near future, and Call of Duty 2, a gritty re-creation of World War II. The most visually impressive 360 game is Kameo: Elements of Power, an action adventure that looks like child's play, with its evocation of a Pixar animated film, but is challenging at points. About half the games for the 360 mimic real-life sports. NBA 2K6, which at times could pass for a live telecast, is the most impressive of the bunch. Amped 3, a snowboarding simulator, is easy to play and gorgeous to watch. SETH SCHIESEL"

                "Tomorrow the Xbox, the new video-game console from Microsoft, arrives in stores on the heels of a $500 million marketing blitz. But it doesn't seem as if much of that money is going to the thousands of musicians who have provided the company with songs to use in the games that will be played on it. Though a band can typically make $10,000 to $20,000 when a song is included in a video game, Microsoft has been asking musicians to contribute their music to video games for pennies -- and in some cases no money at all, with no upfront fee and no royalties on the back end. Musicians, from small, independent punk bands to major-label artists, have been accepting this deal, hoping for the promotional boost that comes with being heard in a game that is played obsessively by teenagers across the country. Joining a band is not a lucrative career choice for most musicians. Many who are signed to major labels spend their careers in debt to those record companies, trying to earn back advances and expenses. But the increasing use of contemporary songs in movies, video games and advertisements has meant an unexpected windfall for lesser-known and midlevel artists. Microsoft, however, is changing that dynamic. ''I asked if we could get any money, and they just said no,'' said Larry Cooper, who runs Revelation Records, a punk, metal and hardcore label that has several songs on the soundtrack to Amped, a snowboarding game. ''I almost thought that out of principle, if there's no payment, we shouldn't do that kind of stuff. But I didn't want to snip out an opportunity for a band that might want to do that kind of promotion.'' Of the bands Mr. Cooper asked, all but one agreed to provide free music to Microsoft. ''I think they were just looking for cheap music, and that's why they called a lot of small labels,'' Mr. Cooper continued. ''I asked them who else was on the soundtrack and made some suggestions, but they said they wanted to stick with certain labels because they didn't have to pay for licensing.'' Brenner Adams, a product planner on Amped, said that on his game Microsoft was looking not for cheap music but for an opportunity to expose as many small underground bands as possible. Under Microsoft policy the interview with Mr. Adams was conducted with a company publicist on the line, taking notes on the conversation. ''We're not saying, 'Hey, we want to use your music for nothing,' '' Mr. Adams said. ''We said, 'Hey, we really want to promote these artists and promote who they are and what they stand for.' '' Though Microsoft didn't give any money to musicians on such independent labels, it did offer small amounts to bands on major labels. It made a deal with Virgin Records, obtaining songs from acts like the Gorillaz, Iggy Pop, the Chemical Brothers and Timbaland & Magoo by paying ''small fees and publishing,'' said Brad Fox, the director of artist development at Virgin. The amount of course remains a big contrast to the millions of dollars that Microsoft is believed to have paid to use Madonna's ''Ray of Light'' in its 60-second Windows XP advertisement. ''We're looking at this as a marketing exercise,'' Mr. Fox said. ''There's no way I could get 10 to 15 different artists in somebody's house in front of an active consumer audience for 20 hours a week. If I could get 20 percent of those kids to go buy a record, that's great.'' But the Xbox isn't like other systems, nor are these deals like other deals. Many record labels are operating on the faith that Microsoft will make efforts to promote their bands. Mr. Fox said he hoped that the Virgin artists used in the games would be mentioned in Xbox promotional material, game catalogs and game boxes. But a trip to the Xbox Web site showed that the artists on games like Amped were not mentioned on the box or promotional poster shown online, nor were the bands on any game highlighted in any special way on the Web site. Other promotional efforts, however, have been made: there was a link at the site to a radio station playing music from Amped, and at a recent Xbox promotional party in Los Angeles Microsoft gave away a CD with music from Amped. Mr. Adams noted that most of the cash deals were made with better-known bands that don't need the publicity as much. ''So,'' he said, ''why not turn the decision around, bring the smaller guys up and give them the promotion they can't get anywhere else?'' He said that music from some 240 artists was used on Amped, that in the game the names of the record labels are shown on banners and that players had the option of seeing names of the bands, songs and record labels. He added that the company hoped to stage more promotions with the music. But there is no guarantee that gamers will hear much if any of the music of these bands. That is because in a feature unique to the Xbox consumers have the option of wiping out the soundtrack to a game and replacing it with music from their own CD's. Originally music executives were less worried about artists not getting paid than about the potential for Xbox to become a new Napster, since it has a large hard drive and online capabilities. But in a statement prepared for this article Microsoft said that though music could be stored on the hard drive, it could not be copied on ''CD's, MP3's or any other devices.'' Other executives in the music publishing business now worry that video game manufacturers and even advertising agencies will follow Microsoft's lead and tell bands that in exchange for use of their music at no cost, an extra effort will be made to promote the groups in products and commercials. As it is, artists sacrifice a lot of money and time at the altar of promotion, taking on costly and inconvenient tasks gratis, like performing concerts promoted by radio stations. So, some wonder, in a field in which just about anything musicians do can be seen as raising their profiles, where is the line between promotional and paid work? Jeff Koz, the chief executive of SubZero, a company that brokers deals between advertisers and musicians, said, ''We believe that people should be paid for what they do.'' Mr. Koz has worked with Microsoft on music and sound design. He added, however, that there was a give-and-take between payment and promotion, and lesser-known artists were often given somewhat lower fees in exchange for what could be career-enhancing exposure. ''There's value to cross-promotion,'' he said, ''and we're not privy to how those Microsoft deals went down. Some of those bands might see it as a tremendous opportunity.'' No. 1 and Dropping The new Britney Spears album, ''Britney,'' will enter the pop charts next week at No. 1 with 769,000 copies sold, according to Soundscan, a company that tracks retail sales. The number, a significant drop from the first-week sales of her previous album (1.3 million), reflects a teenage pop demand that is slipping but still hanging on tenaciously as Ms. Spears sagely remakes her image so she has one foot in the teenage world and the other in the general pop market (an approach best summed up by her song title ''I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman''). The following week, record executives say, ''Britney'' seems likely to slip to No. 2 when the Garth Brooks album ''Scarecrow'' makes its debut with predicted sales of more than one million copies."

                "LOS ANGELES — Microsoft, seeking to expand offerings on its Xbox 360 console, has reached an agreement with a company headed by Peter Safran, the veteran Hollywood producer and talent manager, to produce original shows for distribution on the system. Through his Safran Co., he represents clients like the actor and producer Sean Combs (\"Monster's Ball\"), the actor and writer Nia Vardalos (\"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\") and the filmmakers Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer (\"Epic Movie\"). Safran founded the company in 2006 after leaving Brillstein-Grey Management. Speaking by telephone last week, Scott Nocas, global marketing manager for programming of the Xbox Live entertainment service, said he expected similar deals to follow. \"We definitely look at this as the first of many,\" said Nocas. In an interview at his office in Los Angeles last week, Safran said his first round of programs would be scripted and would probably run under 10 minutes. He said his initial focus would be on genres like comedy and horror that appeal to the Xbox 360 audience, which is heavily concentrated from the ages of 14 to 34, and tends to be more male than female. The first shows are expected to be available to viewers by autumn in the Northern Hemisphere. \"The Xbox is unique; it operates at a level outside of what we generally consider Web entertainment,\" Safran said, referring to the system's tight demographic base, which is defined by the appeal of signature games like the Halo series. The new shows will be available exclusively via the Xbox 360 for a time, then may appear elsewhere, Safran said."

                "Looking for an advantage in the next round of the video-console wars, Microsoft has made the first move. Three and a half years after it entered the console market with the Xbox, Microsoft yesterday unveiled its successor, the Xbox 360, a creamy white console that is to go on sale in North America, Europe and Japan by the holiday season. Though noticeably smaller than its squat black predecessor, the console houses three 3.2-gigahertz I.B.M. microprocessors that could qualify it as the most powerful home computer on the market. Indeed, unlike the original Xbox, the new console can act as a home entertainment hub, streaming pictures, music and video from digital cameras, portable music players and computers that run Microsoft Windows XP. Most evidently different, Xbox 360, which Microsoft introduced last night in a 30-minute presentation on MTV, is designed to display games in wide-screen, high-definition format as well as in standard definition. Microsoft's move, after years of secrecy, rumors and fragmentary disclosures, comes as its competitors -- Sony, the undisputed industry leader, and Nintendo, a close third worldwide -- are also preparing presentations of their coming consoles for the Electronic Entertainment Expo, a major industry trade show, in Los Angeles next week. Representatives of those companies said their game systems, Sony's PlayStation 3 and Nintendo's, which is code-named Revolution, are set for release next year. For the game industry, with $10 billion a year in sales in the United States alone, the consoles' arrivals will not only give rise to new demand for game hardware but will set off a new wave of game development and purchases. As the consoles put new emphasis on high-definition video, they may stimulate TV sales as well. One analyst, describing the anticipation surrounding the announcements, said it was as if Detroit released a new line of automobiles only once every four or five years. \"The business is getting bigger, the stakes are getting higher, and there is such a big leap in technology, potentially making the games ever more realistic and involving,\" said Anita Frazier, entertainment industry analyst for NPD Funworld. Microsoft did not disclose the pricing of its new console. Since their introductions, the current Xbox and Sony's PlayStation 2 have dropped in price from $300 to $150 in the United States; Nintendo's GameCube, originally $200, is now $100. When Xbox arrived in 2001, it was heralded as the most powerful of the consoles and had innovations including a built-in hard drive and an Ethernet port for online play. The machine's biggest hits have been the Halo games, published by Microsoft itself; Halo 2, released last fall, has sold 6.3 million copies. Xbox has also developed a following among game developers, who have been drawn to its power. Still, even with 20 million consoles sold, Xbox has been far outdistanced by Sony's PlayStation 2, with sales of 80 million and 70 percent of the world market. While Halo 2's success put Microsoft's games unit in the black for one quarter last year, the Xbox effort has yet to provide sustained profitability. \"Xbox 1 was very much ready, fire, aim,\" said J Allard, corporate vice president at Microsoft and a leading architect of the Xbox effort. \"We had 19 months and a day between the day we approved the project to the day we were on store shelves.\" For the new Xbox project, Mr. Allard said his team had twice that time and aimed at conceiving a \"magical product\" that was so well integrated it would seem the creation of a single mind. In sheer computing power, the new Xbox is capable of a trillion calculations per second, many orders of magnitude above the original Xbox. (The current box depends mainly on a 733-megahertz processor.) The heat generated by all that power will be drawn off by a water-based cooling system, something usually seen only in high-end PC's. It will also include a redesigned wireless game controller. A Web camera, code-named Cyclops, and a TV-like remote control will be optional. Peter Moore, a Microsoft corporate vice president for worldwide sales and marketing, said Xbox 360 would be especially suited for wide-screen high-definition television and Digital Dolby 5.1 multichannel sound, a requirement for all Xbox 360 games. He added that the new console would also be more seamlessly integrated with Xbox Live, the service that connects games and gamers over high-speed Internet connections for multiplayer action. Xbox Live, which has 1.4 million subscribers, will include a new tier that waives the $6 monthly fee. A demonstration of the console's power delivered stunningly realistic scenes that were indistinguishable at some points from live-action video. \"We have to continue to feed that core audience,\" Robert J. Bach, senior vice president and chief Xbox officer at Microsoft, said of the most ardent gamers. \"But part of the challenge of this next generation is how do we cultivate a broader mass audience.\" Part of that strategy, he said, includes designing Xbox 360 to perform a range of nongaming functions suited to the living room, like streaming digital music and pictures, or videoconferencing. In addition to playing DVD's, as the current Xbox does, it can rip songs from CD's onto a 20-gigabyte hard drive -- a hard drive that can be removed, upgraded and interchanged with other 360 consoles. Judging by dozens of Web sites dedicated to interest in next-generation consoles, expectations are soaring that Xbox 360's competitors will also provide vastly improved graphics, sound and game playing. For example, it is widely believed that Sony's PlayStation 3, which will use a new cell processor technology, will be the most powerful. Molly Smith, a Sony spokeswoman, would not discuss hardware specifics of the PlayStation 3. But she did say that it would be able to deliver \"a quantum leap\" in gaming and electronic entertainment. Nintendo, struggling to shed an image that its technologies mostly appeal to children, is preparing to deliver a game console that is radically different from the cute and cuddly GameCube. Perrin Kaplan, Nintendo's vice president for corporate affairs, said GameCube's successor would be \"very, very sleek.\" She described it as horizontal and no taller than a stack of three DVD cases. Unlike GameCube, the new system will play DVD's, Ms. Kaplin said, and will feature a wireless controller. It will play GameCube games as well as a new class of high-definition games, with new emphasis on online play. Microsoft would not say whether games for the current Xbox would play on Xbox 360. Some industry analysts and game developers said it was likely that games for all three consoles would increase to $60 or $65; the typical price for premium titles on the current machines is $50. \"Over all, the introduction of the next-generation systems will have a very positive impact on the video game industry,\" said Will Kassoy, vice president for global brand management at Activision, a game publisher. \"They will expand the user base and grow software sales.\" Historically, he said, each new cycle of consoles has ushered in a 30 percent rise in the number of players. \"We believe this next generation will see similar growth,\" Mr. Kassoy said. Activision is scheduled to have four games for Xbox 360 at the start, including some of the company's best-selling series -- Tony Hawk, Call to Duty and Quake. Simon Jeffery, president of Sega, said his company would have two titles for Xbox 360 for the holiday season -- Condemned: Criminal Origins and Full Auto -- emphasizing that they will take advantage of the new console's increased power. \"Every successive jump in technology affords new elements of games,\" he said. \"We now will have processing power to do things we haven't been able to do before.\""

                "Sending voice and Webcam picture messages to fellow Xbox 360 players over Microsoft’s Xbox Live service is a cinch, but tapping out old-fashioned text messages using the 360’s onscreen keyboard isn’t much fun. A new $30 miniature keyboard called the Chatpad speeds up text entry to let you best even the fastest BlackBerry touch-typists.  The Chatpad, to go on sale Sept. 6, attaches to the underside of the 360’s controller without interfering with the controller’s comfortable feel in the hands. A backlight makes typing during late-night Gears of War campaigns easier on the eyes, and a dedicated Messenger button activates the 360’s instant messaging program so you can taunt your enemies without breaking from the action. Unfortunately you can’t use the keyboard to type a letter and jump to the corresponding spot in long lists of Xbox Live movie downloads or songs stored on an iPod connected to the 360. Instead, you need to hold down the scroll button. Albert Penello, director for global marketing for Xbox, said the company was looking into a way to add this feature. "

                "FORGET horsepower, forget miles per gallon: the key metric for judging the Nissan Urge, a design study to be introduced today at the North American International Automobile Show in Detroit, is polygons per second, an index of performance for video games. Five hundred million polygons a second is the rating for the Microsoft Xbox 360 video game system tucked away in the car's trunk. It pumps out images fast enough to generate dizzyingly sharp scenes of city streets and speeding cars on a display that folds down from above the windshield. The Urge's key trick is that when parked, its steering wheel and pedals can be used to control the Xbox. The game's soundtrack of roaring engines and screeching tires play through the car's speakers to accompany the action on the screen. Many cars have had video game displays installed in their dashboards. The Urge is the first car to be turned into a game controller -- the tail is now wagging the dog. The Urge, created at Nissan Design America in the La Jolla section of San Diego, is another of the auto industry's seemingly endless quests for \"echo boomer\" customers, a coterie that for carmakers gleams over the horizon the way the mythical city of Eldorado did for the conquistadors. In part, the Urge is a response to an online survey, said John Cupit, a design manager for Nissan. Mr. Cupit interpreted the survey results in the bare, exposed look of the Urge, an articulation of the car's parts aimed, he said, at giving the feel of a motorcycle. The fenders and structure, mostly aluminum, stand out as separate parts. The engine -- a piece of the car so unimportant in this case that Nissan did not even provide the usual specifications of horsepower and torque -- is visible beneath a transparent hood. Nissan calls the look \"minimalism to the maximum.\" The bottoms of the doors are cut away, revealing a surrounding frame of aluminum rendered in \"acid yellow,\" which Anka Mazzei, the color designer, said she chose to express intensity and speed. The front end of the Urge is similar to the GT-R Proto, a concept that Nissan unveiled at the Tokyo auto show last fall. But one should not take the exterior of the Urge too literally. Its weirdness signals that it is unlikely to become a production vehicle. What counts is the concept. Urge is an implicit response to cultural change: young buyers have proved more fascinated by the innovations of their new cellphones, hand-held devices and video games than by the automotive advances that captivated their parents. The showcase game for the Xbox 360 is a special edition of Project Gotham Racing, one of the hit titles for the original Xbox as well. Mr. Cupit said that he and his colleagues at the La Jolla studio spend a lot of time playing on a huge plasma screen. The project was a joint effort with Microsoft, so the Xbox 360 beneath the boattail- shape trunk, one of a half-million consoles shipped since the game system went on sale Nov. 22, is different from the others: no one stood in line to buy it. Video gaming is not the only technology incorporated into the Urge. In addition to the Xbox 360, there is an iPod docking station and a cellphone that doubles as a \"smart key\" to start the engine. In at least one respect, the Urge might be the perfect car: it burns no gasoline while parked for game playing; it generates no emissions; it lines up in no traffic jams. It can virtually roll through the streets of Las Vegas or spin around the Nürburgring. Its version of Gotham Racing can even run uptown on the parts of Broadway that are one-way heading downtown, a special thrill for Manhattan drivers. With a wireless connection, in theory, two Urges could be parked side-by-side for competition like the old racing games at the arcade in Atlantic City. Thanks to the Internet, the same thing could be done even if the Urges were half a world apart. The game encourages stylish driving. Good driving through the curves earns the driver style points, called Kudos, that can be redeemed for a better vehicle. According to the Microsoft programmers, power sliding, pulling off a 360-degree spin, getting air time, drafting and getting up on two wheels \"will earn gamers Kudos points for their style and skill.\" Too bad the real automotive world doesn't work this way. Each car in the game is made up of 80,000 polygons and takes eight days of programming by its creators, who are holed up in the London studio of Bizarre Creations. Real-world details include gauges that move and realistic bug-smash streaks on the windshield. Oddly, the Urge itself is not among the cars you can drive on the screen. That will probably be remedied soon. Project Gotham players and programmers regularly produce new cars that can be downloaded. The Urge's notion of car-as-video game is not unprecedented. A similar concept, the Scion Speedster -- a red Scion xA show car built by 5 Axis Productions in Huntington Beach, Calif. -- was displayed at the Specialty Equipment Market Association trade show in Las Vegas last fall. The Speedster also has an open panel in the doors -- and two Xboxes running the Forza racing game onboard. The two cars simply evolved at the same time, Mr. Cupit said. He prefers his version of the idea. \"We tried to take seriously designing the door glass to protect the occupants from wind and rain, and also vehicle ingress-egress,\" he said. \"Our door moves up and down to ease entry into the car, for example.\" \"We often visit tuner and customizing shows to see what young people are thinking about,\" Mr. Cupit said. \"The Urge helps reinvent the sports car for the next generation of young people.\" Observing young people at auto shows, it is impossible not to note that they pay more attention to how their cars look and sound than how fast they go. The investment tends to go into electronics and colorful bolt-on parts, rather than into making the engine run faster and more furious. Maybe more automakers should put Xboxes in their cars. General Motors and Ford might stir up interest by tucking Xbox 360's into all their trunks."

                "REDMOND, Wash. — Microsoft is betting it has a new way to win the wallets of consumers. The company on Tuesday introduced the new version of its Xbox video game console. The Xbox has been one of Microsoft’s few undeniable consumer hits of the last decade, a product that was not just a credible entry into the games business but also a sign of the innovation possible at a company that is rarely seen as an inventive thinker. “I think of Xbox as the accidental success out of Microsoft,” said James McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester Research, who added that the connection Microsoft has formed with the players of its current Xbox is “much deeper than any relationship Microsoft has ever achieved before.”  The new console, the Xbox One, will enter a market very different from the one its predecessor, the Xbox 360, entered nearly eight years ago, when there was no iPad, smartphones had keyboards and mobile gaming devices were primitive at best.  Today, video games can be played almost anywhere, on any device, with the biggest possible audience of online friends and without the aid of a costly gaming console. The last year or two has been bumpy for Microsoft’s consumer efforts. The Windows 8 operating system software and the Surface tablet-computing devices got a tepid reception from the public when they went on sale last fall.  The company’s mobile phone efforts have been largely ignored. And even Bing, Microsoft’s Internet search engine, has failed to close a wide gap with Google, the market leader.  Microsoft, though, could see better results with the Xbox. With it, it hopes it can reassert the living room as the place where people can still get the best gaming experience, complete with eye-popping graphics and innovative methods for controlling games. It is also a place where Microsoft’s technology can be at the center of a home entertainment system and the funnel through which people gain access to online video. Microsoft has sold more than 76 million of the device’s current incarnation, the Xbox 360 worldwide, compared with almost 100 million Wii consoles from Nintendo and more than 70 million PlayStation 3s from Sony.  The company also controls what may be the most valuable asset in console gaming, Xbox Live, a subscription-based online service with 48 million members who use it to play games against one another and watch movies.  “You can do a lot of things on the phone and a lot of things on tablets,” said John Taylor, an analyst at Arcadia Investment. But, he said, “you can’t do the same kinds of things on those devices” that you can on a television screen. Microsoft plans to develop its own original, live-action television series, which will be accessible through the Xbox. The series will be made in partnership with the director Steven Spielberg and will be based on the popular Halo video game franchise.  The company is also working with the National Football League to develop an app for Xbox that lets players interact with their fantasy football teams while watching a live game. In an interview, Don A. Mattrick, the president of Microsoft’s interactive entertainment business, said that he recognized the growing appeal of mobile devices for gaming and that Microsoft would aggressively tie smartphones and tablets into the experience of using its console. He became most animated when talking about the possibilities of the new Xbox for providers of video programming. “We’re going to the take the form from a one-way experience pushed through a straw to where you can communicate back and make it interactive,” Mr. Mattrick said.  Even if it is a wild success, the new Xbox is likely to have a bigger impact on consumer perception than it will on Microsoft’s overall sales. The Xbox remains a small slice of the company’s business, which is still dominated by sales of Windows, Office and other software. The company’s games division represented only 4 percent of its operating profit. At an event in a carnival tent on its corporate campus, Microsoft did not say how much the new system would cost or how publishing partners would charge for games, which typically start at around $60 for high-end game consoles.  A major feature of the new Xbox, which is expected to hit store shelves in time for the holiday season, will be a new generation of Kinect, the camera-based motion-control sensor introduced several years ago as an Xbox 360 accessory. The new Kinect will come with every Xbox One. Traditional retail sales of games have come under pressure in recent years as mobile devices like the iPhone and iPad have invaded their turf with free and low-cost games. While many gamers dismiss those offerings as inferior to console games, the games have nevertheless tapped into a huge audience of players who may never have played on an Xbox or Sony’s PlayStation. The games business could use a jolt. Total United States retail sales of game hardware and software fell 25 percent to $495.2 million in April from $657.5 million a year earlier, according to estimates by NPD Group, a research firm. That figure does not include the sale of downloadable content over the Internet. Alex St. John, an entrepreneur who worked on Microsoft’s pre-Xbox game efforts, says he is pessimistic about prospects for gaming consoles. “They’re coming out with the latest and greatest stone tool,” Mr. St. John said. “The new console that trumps the old console is called the Apple iPad. This generation of kids loves mobile games.”"

                "Three months after surprising the video game industry with strong sales of its first console, the Microsoft Corporation will dispatch its chairman, Bill Gates, to Tokyo this week to introduce its assault on an inhospitable Japanese market. Not since the industry's early days, when Atari competed for space in video arcades, has a major American game company tried to dethrone Japanese hardware makers on their own turf. When it begins selling its Xbox game system in Japan on Friday, Microsoft will try to use the star power of Mr. Gates and a lineup of specialized games to battle the leaders, Sony and Nintendo. Many industry insiders predict that the Xbox, which has sold more than 1.5 million units in North America since November, will face tough going in Japan, where American software companies have found tremendous difficulties merely putting their games onto store shelves. ''You are talking about a closed market and going up against two very strong, very entrenched competitors,'' said Heath A. Terry, a game software analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston. ''For Microsoft to expect significant success early on in that market is unrealistic.'' The Xbox has other strikes against it for Japanese consumers, who buy about a third of the world's game products. Analysts worry that the console is too big for the living room in a country where smaller gadgets rule. And at about $260, the Xbox costs $40 more than Sony's PlayStation2 and $75 more than Nintendo's GameCube. Yet analysts and software makers acknowledge that Microsoft, the world's No. 1 software company, managed the North American rollout of the Xbox better than they had expected. They also noted that it has deep pockets and has shown unflagging persistence in entering other businesses. The company has already made one significant adjustment specifically for Japan: after criticism from early testers, it built smaller game controllers, with buttons closer together, to better fit the hands of the average Japanese player. Peter Moore, president and chief operating officer for Sega of America, the American division of the Japanese games publisher, said Microsoft's early success in North America gave the company a fighting chance in Japan and Europe, where the Xbox goes on sale on March 14. ''It's eerily reminiscent of the power of the launch of the PlayStation,'' he said, referring to Sony's first console. ''The way a powerful global company can attack an industry, get under its skin and change an industry.'' Hirohisa Ohura, who runs Microsoft's Xbox division in Japan, said the North American introduction had proved that the company could compete in the video game business. While calling Japan ''the most challenging market'' for the Xbox, he said Microsoft would keep chipping away at its competitors for the loyalty of Japanese game players. ''U.S. companies coming into Japan as a game vendor tended to fail and walk away real quick,'' Mr. Ohura said. ''We're not willing to give up at any point. Once we're in this business, we're in here to win.'' In its quest for the buzz that makes or breaks video games, Microsoft set up hundreds of Xbox kiosks in Tokyo and Osaka earlier this month. And for the introduction on Friday, Mr. Gates himself will stump for the Xbox at an event similar to his appearance last November at the opening of the Toys ''R'' Us store in Times Square. Microsoft began taking advance orders on Feb. 2 for consoles, including 50,000 special edition systems with a translucent case and a silver-plated key chain engraved with the autograph of Mr. Gates -- an accessory that has been mocked on online message boards and game publications. Sony, the consumer electronics giant, has an enormous head start on Microsoft. By Dec. 31, Sony said, it had shipped 25 million of its next-generation consoles, the PlayStation2, including 10 million to North America and 8 million to Japan. ''The burden isn't on our company to compete with them; the burden is significantly on Microsoft to compete with us,'' said Molly Smith, a spokeswoman for Sony Computer Entertainment America, the company's American division. The list of best-selling software is dominated by titles that run on the PlayStation2. Yet while they have capitalized on Sony's success in North America, large American game publishers have found the Japanese market difficult to penetrate and have been forced to cooperate with Japanese publishers to develop games specifically for Japan and have games sold there. Electronic Arts is the No. 1 publisher of PlayStation2 titles in North America, but only No. 7 in Japan. ''The secret in Japan is getting product that's culturally appealing to Japanese consumers,'' said Stan McKee, chief financial officer of Electronic Arts. Microsoft has forged partnerships of its own with more than 90 Japanese publishers, but still faces an uphill battle. Because of Sony's lead, analysts said, Microsoft will consider its introduction a success if it wins close to 20 percent of the Japanese market."

                "Reaching out to millions of aspiring game developers around the world, Microsoft plans today to announce a contest that will award $10,000 and the opportunity to entice millions of eyeballs to the next great digital diversion for the company’s Xbox 360. In addition to the game console’s snazzy graphics, the Xbox Live online service has been the most important component of the Xbox 360’s success since its debut in 2005. And perhaps the most popular aspect of Xbox Live has been the service’s arcade component, which allows users to download and play smaller, relatively simpler games like Uno and Geometry Wars that usually cost less than $10. (By contrast, top-end games can sell in stores for around $60.) The popularity of Xbox Live Arcade has in turn attracted the attention of game developers looking to create the next Tetris or Minesweeper. Late last year, Microsoft introduced a suite of software tools for making so-called casual games called XNA.  And so at a game makers’ convention in San Francisco, Microsoft plans to announce a contest akin to the television show “Project Greenlight” that will award a cash prize and a potential slot on Xbox Live Arcade to the best new game created with XNA tools. The company intends to announce the winner of the contest, called “Dream-Build-Play,” in August.  “This competition highlights the power of XNA and the popularity of the Xbox Live Arcade service with its millions of users,” Aaron Greenberg, Microsoft’s group product manager for the Xbox 360 and Xbox Live, said in a telephone interview.  To help increase the popularity of casual games, Microsoft will also announce the introduction of a new 512-megabyte portable storage device for the Xbox 360. The previous portable storage unit contained only 64 megabytes of data, and so Xbox Live Arcade games had been limited to an official size of 50 megabytes. With the new unit, Microsoft will also raise the official size limit on Xbox Live Arcade games to 150 megabytes, allowing enhanced graphics, sound and artificial intelligence. SETH SCHIESEL"

                "Raising the ante in the video game wars, Microsoft is bringing out a new version of the Xbox 360 game machine that has a bigger hard drive, better high-definition video support and a stylish black finish, not an insignificant feature in a world where looking cool ranks high. The idea is to appeal to an elite class of hardcore game players who would like a little more of everything.   “Today’s games-and-entertainment enthusiast has an insatiable appetite for digital high-definition content,” said Peter Moore, corporate vice president for Microsoft’s interactive entertainment business, in Redmond, Wash.   The Xbox 360 Elite, which is to be announced today and will be in stores in late April, will have a list price of $479, or $80 more than the Xbox 360 Pro and $180 more than the basic Xbox 360. The new model has a 120-gigabyte hard drive, in contrast to the standard model’s 20-gigabyte drive. It also has a high-definition multimedia interface port and cable and a wireless controller and headset. Current Xbox 360 owners can buy the new 120-gigabyte hard drive as a separate accessory for $179.  Microsoft is clearly hoping to fill what it sees as a hole at the top end of the market. The Nintendo Wii has been outselling the PlayStation 3 from Sony and the Xbox 360 in recent months, but that system is largely positioned as a family-friendly game machine that can be purchased for $50 less than the lowest-priced Xbox. The Sony system is priced higher than both the Nintendo and the Microsoft systems, with the cheapest model priced at $499.  Both Microsoft and Sony have positioned their consoles as entertainment hubs, not just for playing sophisticated video games but also for listening to music and viewing downloaded movies and television shows.   John Rodman, group product manager for the Xbox platform and Xbox Live, pointed to a recent Microsoft survey that revealed that nearly 40 percent of the time that Xbox 360 users spent with their consoles was for activities other than gaming.   Yet when it comes to gaming, Xbox 360 users are serious, Mr. Rodman says. Six out of 10 Xbox 360 users use Xbox Live, Microsoft’s online gaming service.   “We don’t feel like the Wii customer and the Xbox customer are the same thing,” he said. “We think that as soon as the Wii customer turns 14 they want something else.”  James L. McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester Research, said that Microsoft hoped to encourage customers to spend more money downloading movies and games, which require considerable hard-drive space. "

                "LOS ANGELES  Reaching out beyond hardcore video game players to everyday consumers, Microsoft outlined an entertainment strategy on Monday for making the company’s Xbox 360 game console a gateway for movies, television and social networking. In a media presentation on the eve of E3, the video game industry’s biggest North American convention, Microsoft announced new relationships with the social networking giants Facebook and Twitter as well as Sky, the big British satellite television provider that is a unit of the News Corporation.  Microsoft announced that Facebook users would be able to access their profiles and share photos on their television through the Xbox Live network and that Twitter devotees would also be able to post and read messages through the service.  More far-reaching was Microsoft’s new deal with Sky, under which Xbox Live users in Britain will be able to watch live television, including professional soccer, over an Internet version of the Sky service. Not every channel available over satellite will be available over Xbox Live, but the offering will include dozens of stations, Microsoft executives said. Users will be able to watch television in a virtual party room with their friends, discussing the program as they are watching, they said.  Microsoft has long sought a bigger role in home television, going so far in years past as to try to build its own set-top box business. Partnering with Sky represents a back door into the television market. The company has also recognized how Nintendo has expanded the traditional audience for video games with its innovative motion-sensitive controller for the Wii. Microsoft provided the first public demonstration of its futuristic Project Natal, which it hopes will usher in an age of completely controller-free gaming.  Using a sophisticated camera, infrared sensors and voice recognition software, Natal allows users to control a game or other programs, like a virtual painting studio, merely by waving their arms, speaking to the system and moving around. Microsoft did not say when the technology would become available. Microsoft also demonstrated some of its coming big games, including Forza Motorsport 3, the suspense-thriller Alan Wake and a new version of its biggest hit, Halo. Hideo Kojima, the developer behind the Metal Gear series, said that the next major installment in that franchise would be available for Xbox 360, a coup for Microsoft because previous Metal Gear games had been exclusive to Sony game machines."

                " NEW YORK — Buyers of the Xbox 360, Microsoft's second-generation video game console, will expect to play big, expensive marquee games like \"Call of Duty 2\" from Activision and \"Madden NFL 06\" by Electronic Arts. But Microsoft is also banking on them to play small arcade-style video games, purchased and downloaded from the Internet. Unlike its competitors, the Sony PlayStation 2 and Nintendo GameCube, the new Xbox, which goes on sale on Nov. 22, can play games on two separate tracks. One is the familiar terrain of big-budget, deeply immersive games that feel more like interactive movies than games. The other is a return to the video game's arcade roots. But the arcade games are not simple, said Greg Canessa, group manager of Xbox Live Arcade, part of the Xbox division.\"Arcade games are really miniature Xbox 360 games,\" he said. The price is somewhat miniaturized as well. To develop the arcade games cost $100,000 to $200,000, compared with $15 million to $20 million for the larger games. The arcade games will be sold only online, downloadable through the Xbox's broadband-only Internet connection. Microsoft has not officially announced prices for the games, but it is widely expected that they will cost $5 to $10. By contrast, new Xbox games sold at retailers like Best Buy are likely to cost $60, or about $10 more than previous Xbox games, according to some game publishers. The new machines, slimmer and more powerful than the original Xbox released in 2001, will cost $300 for a basic model and $400 for a model with a 20-gigabyte hard drive. They will also be able to play DVDs, CDs and standard music files, including MP3 and Windows Media Audio files, as well as display digital snapshots on a TV screen. Those functions and the arcade-type gaming feature are central to Microsoft's strategy to reach a broader family market, beyond the young male players who have been the Xbox's primary audience.To do that, Peter Moore, vice president for marketing at Xbox International, said Microsoft would eliminate the need for credit cards in making online purchases of games, accessories and upgrades. Instead of credit cards, the Xbox Live online service will accept Microsoft value cards that can be bought in various denominations online or at retail and convenience stores, Moore said. The value cards would function, in effect, like tokens in an arcade. \"We have to get credit cards out of the way,\" he said. \"We've got to broaden this to younger demographics.\" Another big selling point for the 360 is its enhanced Internet connectivity through the Xbox Live service.Microsoft will give Xbox 360 owners a free subscription to Xbox Live Silver, which gives players access to the online system's features, including the ability to buy and download games. A Gold membership, at $50 a year, permits users to play games with others over the Internet. Canessa, the group manager of Xbox Live Arcade, said that each arcade game could play at 1080i high definition and that most could take advantage of the 360's ability to communicate with other players over a broadband Internet connection. \"We will have from 12 to 15 games by launch,\" Canessa said. At least 75 percent, he added, will be capable of being played live online by more than one player.Each Xbox 360, he said, will include a free copy of the full version of \"Hexic HD,\" an arcade-style puzzle game developed by Alexey Pajitnov, the creator of \"Tetris.\" \"We created a whole market, a whole new world, for downloadable games,\" Canessa said. While online arcade games have proved popular on personal computers, Canessa said he believed that the 360's embrace of arcade games would further invigorate independent game design. \"The indie game developers is one of the opportunities I'm most excited about,\" he said. \"You have small, independent, three guys in a garage making games, totally innovating. It's the Sundance Film Festival, if you will, of games.\" "

                " SEATTLE — In a bid to make its games unit profitable by 2007, Microsoft is planning to start selling a more expensive version of its Xbox game console this autumn. The premium Xbox 360 console will sell for $399.99 in the United States, nearly three times the price of the current Xbox, according to an announcement made by Microsoft on Wednesday. The premium console will sell for399.99, or $490.67, in Continental Europe, while its scaled-back version, called \"Xbox 360 Core System,\" will sell for $299.99 in the United States and299.99 in Europe. Microsoft is counting on the new releases of its console to make its video game unit profitable by 2007, according to Robert Bach, senior vice president for Microsoft's home and entertainment division. The game unit of Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, has lost $2.8 billion in the last three years, while Sony's rival console, the PlayStation, is profitable. Bach predicted that the Xbox 360 would outsell Sony's PlayStation 3, which is scheduled for release next year, even though the PlayStation 2 has outsold the Xbox by nearly 4 to 1. Various Xbox accessories, like a 20-gigabyte detachable hard drive and a wireless controller that will be delivered with the premium version of the console, will also be available for purchase as an add-on for the less expensive \"core\" console. Microsoft is also planning to sell other Xbox accessories, like a wireless controller and TV remote, a headset for the Xbox Live online service and an Ethernet cable for high-speed Internet connections. The company said that it remained on target to ship the new Xbox to stores in North America, Europe and Japan in time for the upcoming holiday season, ahead of Sony's PlayStation 3, which is slated to replace the PlayStation 2 in the spring. Bach noted that both new versions of the Xbox would support high-definition visuals and play music and movies. These features were not part of the original Xbox release, which cost $299 four years ago but now sells for $150. Matt Rosoff, an analyst at the independent research firm Directions on Microsoft, said he doubted that enthusiasts would balk at the price increase for the new releases.\"Hard-core gamers will be on board,\" Rosoff said. \"I think the sticker shock might be in the larger audience Microsoft is trying to reach,\" like casual game players and neophytes, he added. Microsoft sells its current Xbox console at a loss because its primary goal was to break into the lucrative game market. It makes money selling games, but does not expect its home and entertainment division to post profits regularly until 2007. \"They need to not lose a lot of money on the console this time,\" said Ben Bajarin, an analyst at Creative Strategies in Campbell, California. \"They'd like to get closer to a small margin of profit on the console.\" The core console will not be able to play games designed for the original Xbox unless a consumer spends $99.99 to add a hard drive. Microsoft has asked developers working on future games to make them in such a way that they could be played on both the fully loaded and basic versions of the console. Pricing for the new Xbox in Japan, where Microsoft sells just a few hundred consoles a week, will not be announced until the Tokyo Game Show in September, Bach said. "

                " SAN JOSE, California — The tit-for- tat battle for customers between Sony and Microsoft continued Thursday as the Japanese electronics group announced plans to introduce an online gaming service when its PlayStation 3 video game console is released in the fall. The news of the service, which lets users buy games and communicate and compete with other players via the Web, comes days after Tokyo-based Sony said that it would delay the release of its next-generation PlayStationconsole until November, putting it a year behind Microsoft's popular Xbox 360. The much-awaited start had originally been scheduled for the spring and the news, on March 15, prompted Microsoft to announce this week that it was more than doubling shipments of the Xbox 360. Phil Harrison, president of worldwide studios for Sony Computer Entertainment, said that the basic level of Sony's online service, known internally as PlayStation Network Platform, would be free, and would allow users to play against each other online, e-mail and chat with friends. Additional game services and premium content will be made available to users who pay a subscription fee, Harrison said. Sony, one of the world's leading technology manufacturers and entertainment companies, is hoping to retain its dominance over the roughly $30 billion global video game market with the PS3. Microsoft introduced the Xbox 360 game console in November. The company's Xbox Live subscription service, which offers game downloads and online play, has been a hit on the new machine and Sony had been widely expected to offer a similar service. Built in collaboration with Sony Online Entertainment, which already offers PC game downloads and a marketplace for trading virtual assets, the service was inspired by businesses like the online auction site eBay and the online retailer Amazon.com, where communities of users contribute ratings and recommendations. It also steals a page from social networking sites like Myspace.com, which has attracted millions of users. \"We have to fall into step with consumer expectations,\" said Harrison, who said the social aspects of the network promise to get people more involved in gaming. With broadband adoption on the rise and television viewership dropping, advertisers are exploring the possibility of buying ad space in games much like they now do on the Web. \"This can provide a tremendous revenue stream for our industry,\" Harrison said. Video game makers, which have seen sales fall as gamers wait and save for new consoles, have been under pressure to find new ways to offset rising game development costs. Microsoft said Tuesday that Xbox Live had logged more than 10 million downloads.More than 85 percent of Xbox 360 consoles that are connected to the Internet have downloaded games, trailers and videos from the subscription service, Microsoft said. Downloads appeal to many game makers, because they can cut costs by selling direct to consumers. Online distribution also gives them a way to head off piracy and used game sales by providing a way to check that the player of a game is also its owner. Anita Frazier, an analyst with NPD Group, a market research company, said most publishers were \"treading lightly\" into direct online sales of games because they do not want to alienate retailers, but added that such services would likely open the market for more games.$@ "

                "Executives at Microsoft are fond of saying that its subscription gaming service, Xbox Live, should be thought of as a cable channel. They want Xbox to be seen not merely as a gaming machine for teenagers, but as a media portal for parents and grandparents, too. The company is even producing shows for users: it is in the middle of the second season of “1 vs. 100,” an interactive version of a game show that was on NBC. The content ambitions do not end there. Microsoft has held in-depth talks with the Walt Disney Company about a programming deal with ESPN, according to people close to the talks, who requested anonymity because the talks were intended to be private. For a per-subscriber fee, ESPN could provide live streams of sporting events, similar to the ones available through ESPN 360, a service that is available from some high-speed Internet providers. Microsoft could also create some interactive games in association with ESPN, the people said. One of the people said the deal was not imminent. The companies declined to comment. Already, video game consoles are putting a new emphasis on the video, rather than the game.  The roughly 20 million monthly members of Xbox Live can surf Facebook, browse an online mall of movies and TV episodes and, if they pay, watch Netflix.  “It’s 20 million connected living rooms,” said Marc Whitten, the general manager of Xbox Live. Similarly, users of the Sony PlayStation can tune into BBC shows and see Weather Channel updates, as well as stream Netflix. Last week, Netflix extended its streaming service to the Nintendo Wii.  Among the many companies that want to transport the on-demand qualities of the Internet into the living room  the over-the-top model, in industry parlance  the console makers have a significant head start. Nearly 60 percent of American homes now have at least one console, according to the consulting firm Deloitte, up from 44 percent three years ago. “For both of the big guys, it’s about extending the value of the hardware platform,” said Mike McGuire, a vice president for the research firm Gartner, referring to Microsoft and Sony. “The devices are hooked to TVs and have broadband connections, and there are more and more opportunities to license movies and TV shows and deliver them in over-the-top models.” Microsoft said this month that it had sold 39 million Xbox 360 consoles around the world. About half sign into Xbox Live each month. At that size, “it starts to feel like a cable network,” said Mark Kroese, who oversees Xbox advertising sales for Microsoft. The company does not specify how many members pay for access to premium services like Netflix; basic functions of Xbox Live are free. The company says it regularly counts more than a million concurrent users  and topped out at 2.2 million at one point during Christmas week last month. That compares favorably to some of the top channels on cable, like TBS and the Cartoon Network, which reach about one million viewers at any given time, according to the Nielsen Company.  The comparisons are crude at best because many of Xbox Live’s users are playing games rather than watching video. No third-party measurement exists, because ratings companies like Nielsen do not yet track the service fully. But there is no doubt that consoles are expanding their domain, something that is evident in Mr. Whitten’s vision of the service: “The entertainment you want, the people you care about, wherever you are.” The addition of Netflix in late 2008 was an important step into the entertainment arena for Xbox, and perhaps a precursor to Microsoft’s current talks with Hollywood producers. Without releasing specific numbers, Mr. Whitten said the streaming movies and TV service were “very, very popular,” including in his own household. Mr. Whitten said Microsoft wanted to be a bigger player in television and film viewing. He declined to comment on the conversations with Disney but said more than once that “there’s going to be a ton of experimentation around business models and rights.” “Our goal is, really, how can we get as much content there as possible,” he said. Disney is not alone in showing an interest in the console market. Many companies sell TV episodes and film rentals through Microsoft’s online store, and Web video ventures are clamoring to have a place on the service. Console makers have a long way to go to be considered replacements for cable subscriptions, but, at the very least, they could put a dent in the time spent viewing traditional TV. The interactive game show “1 vs. 100” drew well over 100,000 concurrent users at times during its first season last year, according to Microsoft’s internal data. During the second season, which began in November, two-hour TV-style trivia competitions are scheduled on Tuesday and Friday nights. A voice-over announcer, shown onscreen as an avatar, provides live color commentary. Like the defunct NBC show, the game has a contestant, “The One,” and a “Mob” of 100 other players. Members of the audience can watch passively or play along, improving their odds of being picked to play for prizes. Unlike on the live-action TV show, every player on Xbox is represented by a cartoonish avatar. Dave McCarthy, a general manager at Microsoft Game Studios, said the scheduled TV-style shows provided a guarantee that “you’re a part of something bigger.” Beyond the game show realm, Microsoft also exclusively shows “The Guild,” a sitcom that it bills as “Seinfeld” meets video game culture. It stars its creator, the actress Felicia Day, and is sponsored by Sprint. For advertisers like Sprint, online communities like Xbox Live are another arena to pursue consumers. Within “1 vs. 100” there are 15- and 30-second commercial breaks like on TV. Those spots account for about 15 percent of the service’s advertising revenue; most of the rest comes from ads on Xbox Live navigation pages, like display ads on Web sites.  In November, Nielsen started to track “1 vs. 100” play and ad views. The pilot program “is the tip of the iceberg,” said Gerardo Guzman, a director for Nielsen Games; eventually, he hopes to generate TV-style ratings. Mr. Kroese said Xbox advertisers were “very interested in being able to compare the media buy on Xbox to other media buys they do.” Microsoft says nearly half of Xbox Live members use its entertainment content; the rest mostly play multiplayer games. But it expects that more of its users will try the entertainment side and the line between them will blur further. “I don’t think there’s a real difference between a game and ‘Lost.’ Or a game and ‘American Idol.’ They’re all ways we spend our leisure time,” Mr. Whitten said.  Over time, he predicted, “these narrow swim lanes  games, music, movies, etc.  will dissolve.”"

                "LOS ANGELES, July 5 — In what may be one of the costliest consumer warranty repairs in history, Microsoft announced on Thursday that it would spend up to $1.15 billion to repair failing Xbox 360 game machine consoles. While the company would not say how many units were failing, Robbie Bach, president of Microsoft’s entertainment and devices division, said that there have been an “unacceptable high number of repairs.” The majority of Xbox 360 owners, he said, have not experienced hardware failure.  Company officials said that Microsoft had sold 11.6 million Xbox 360 units by the end of June, shy of the 12 million units the company had predicted. The Xbox 360, which first went of sale in November 2005, is currently the best-selling game machine in the United States, according to NPD, a market research firm. The size of the anticipated repair bill suggests that a third to as many as half of the machines are flawed.  Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., said it would take a charge of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion against earnings in the quarter ended June 30. Consumers know they have a problem if three red flashing lights appear on the console. Gamers on online forums have been referring to the event as “the Red Ring of Death” because the machine then shuts down.  The company declined to explain the nature of the failure, but said that it was not caused by a single problem in the console, which it said contained 1,700 components and 500 million transistors. The company also said there were no health or safety concerns involved. The problem began to appear over the last three to four months, Mr. Bach said, after “significant usage” of the consoles. He said the company has taken steps to correct the problem in new devices. Microsoft said it would extend the warranty of the game console to three years to customers worldwide. Previously, products sold in the United States were covered by a one-year warranty, while Xbox 360 units sold in Europe had a two-year warranty.  In addition, customers who have had their consoles repaired because of the “three flashing lights” problem will be reimbursed for the cost of the repairs. Microsoft has succeeded in establishing the Xbox brand against the better known Sony PlayStation and other game machines. The Xbox and its successor, the Xbox 360, was the software maker’s first major foray into hardware. Although sales are small relative to the rest of Microsoft’s revenue, the Xbox has been an important venture for the company and was viewed by many analysts as Microsoft’s attempt to compete with the likes of Sony and Apple for control of electronics and entertainment within homes.  The device can be used to access the Internet and view movies. Microsoft said its entertainment and devices division reported an operating loss of $315 million on $929 million in revenue for the three-month period that ended in March, and analysts have estimated that the company lost about $6 billion getting a foothold in the game machine industry.  A new Xbox 360 with a 20-gigabyte hard drive sells for about $400, but other versions cost about $300.  The announcement comes on the eve of the E3 Media and Business Summit, the video-game industry’s major trade show, to be held next week in Los Angeles. “This is bound to affect discussions between Microsoft and its developers and retailers,” said Richard Doherty, a partner in the research company Envisioneering Group."

                "One of the enduring attractions of comic books and graphic novels is the ease with which they explain the universe. Evil is identifiable, external and fairly simple to vanquish with the application of the appropriate superpowers. And sometimes, as in the case of ABC Family’s new comic-based series “The Middleman,” evil is downright funny. In “Middleman’s” first episode, last week, a slimy, many-eyed, multitentacled creature erupts in a DNA lab. Later, evil’s personification is a mobster ape with a machine gun. These over-the-top creatures are more comic than threatening. Usually the phrase “cartoonish violence” is a pejorative; here it’s a compliment. “The Middleman,” written as a graphic novel by Javier Grillo-Marxuach, who has also written for the series “Lost” and “Medium,” stars Matt Keeslar in the title role, a straight-arrow, milk-drinking former member of the Navy Seals who stands between us and horrors we’re not even aware of, fighting evil “so you don’t have to.” He dresses like a Canadian Mountie and delivers his lines with the stone-face confidence of a young Peter Graves. Early on, he explains the world to his protégée. “You know how in comic books there’s all kinds of mad scientists and aliens and androids and monsters who want to either take over or destroy the world?” he asks. “Well, it really does work like that.” This is news to Wendy Watson (Natalie Morales), an art-school graduate and temp secretary whose calm in the face of the multitentacled slime creature  she stabs it with a letter opener  inspires the Middleman to recruit her. “You’re good under pressure,” he says. She asks, “Are you hitting on me?” There is some sexual tension between these two, but you hope it won’t become a big part of the story; there’s much more interesting material here. “Middleman” is full of hilarious throwaways, as when our hero, preparing to drink a glass of “cool refreshing milk” with some bad guys, empties his pockets  of grenades, flamethrowers and a crossbow.  The genius is in the details. When the Middleman asks Wendy if she has experience with firearms, and she says she’s a pacifist, he looks at her fingers. Their calluses tell him that she is a veteran Xbox player. “You probably have better hand-eye than a bush sniper,” he concludes. “Middleman” skillfully incorporates real-life details into its fantastic scenarios. Its characters aren’t just Manichaean warriors; they also live the kinds of lives that people read comic books to escape from. “Did I get any calls?” Wendy asks her roommate after a rough day at the office. The roommate says: “Yeah. Your mom called to ask if you’re a lesbian.” That would be the mom whom Wendy describes as “on me 24/7 to quit painting, move back to Orlando, meet a good man, eat fried foods, swell up like a tick and start squeezing out calves like Elsie mainlining fertility drugs.” Then there’s the motive of the mad scientist who created the gun-toting ape; she’s just trying to compensate for federal cuts to her research grants. Saving the world is easy; making a world as complex and funny as this one is the real feat of “Middleman.” THE MIDDLEMAN ABC Family, Monday nights at 8, Eastern and Pacific times; 7, Central time. Created by Javier Grillo-Marxuach, based on his Viper Comics graphic novels, with illustrations by Les McClaine; directed by Jeremiah Chechik; Mr. Grillo-Marxuach and John Ziffren, executive producers; Hans Beimler, co-executive producer; Jon Pare, producer; Sarah Watson, co-producer; Mr. Chechik and Tracey Stern, supervising producers.  WITH: Matt Keeslar (the Middleman), Natalie Morales (Wendy Watson), Mary Pat Gleason (Ida), Brit Morgan (Lacey) and Jake Smollett (Noser)."

                "TOKYO, Dec. 16 - In the United States, Microsoft's Xbox 360 video game console has been so popular it is hard to keep on store shelves. But in Tokyo's neon-drenched Akihabara neighborhood, known as Electronics Town, there are plenty of the sleek white machines to go around, if you can find takers. At Yodobashi Camera, an eight-story electronics department store selling everything from hair curlers to home computer servers, a small corner display of Xbox 360's draws little attention from passing shoppers. It is not hard to figure out why. Lined up on a rack near the display are the only nine games sold for Xbox 360. But behind it are some 3,000 games, spread across six store aisles, for Microsoft's biggest rival here, the Sony PlayStation 2. \"Xbox doesn't even have Gran Turismo,\" said Shun'ichi Moriizumi, naming a popular auto racing game. One of the few shoppers to stop in front of the Xbox display, Mr. Moriizumi, a 22-year-old university student, said he came to see the Xbox 360, which went on sale here Dec. 10, 18 days after its debut in the United States. \"I like the graphics,\" he said \"But I'm not going to buy it, at least not today. I'm waiting until the new PlayStation comes out before deciding which to buy.\" That appears to be a common sentiment in Japan, the world's second-largest video game market after the United States. The Xbox 360 had a disappointing opening day in Japan. During the first weekend the Xbox 360 was in stores, Microsoft sold 62,135 of about 159,000 machines shipped, or about 39 percent, according to a Japanese market research company, Enterbrain. That pace was even slower than in 2002, when Microsoft introduced its earlier Xbox model in Japan, where it was considered a flop. Microsoft was hoping to make a bigger splash this time, not just because of the market's size here but also because of Japan's importance as a proving ground for new products. Japan is, after all, home to Microsoft's two biggest rivals in video games, Sony and Nintendo, and its software companies write many of the games played worldwide, from Super Mario Brothers to Final Fantasy. Winning over Japan's finicky consumers, who are known to reject games for seemingly minor shortcomings in performance and appearance, represents a coveted seal of approval, analysts say. So far, Microsoft has failed the test. As of June, the latest data available, 470,000 Xbox machines over all have been sold in Japan, versus 13 million in the United States, according to the market research site Famitsu.com. That gave Xbox a mere 2 percent slice of the 22 million game machines sold in Japan. By contrast, Xbox had a 25 percent share of the 52 million machines sold in the United States, according to Famitsu. Analysts say the biggest hurdle the Xbox 360 faces in Japan is the dominance of Sony and to a lesser extent Nintendo. Sony has 81 percent of the Japanese market; Nintendo has most of the rest, according to Famitsu. Worldwide, PlayStation's market share is about 68 percent; Xbox is in second place with 17 percent and Nintendo has the rest. Microsoft had hoped to steal a march by rolling out its next-generation XBox game machine ahead of its two Japanese rivals. Sony plans to sell its newest game console, PlayStation 3, in the spring, though the company will not say exactly when. Nintendo says it will release its new console, Revolution, in 2006. But Microsoft's strategy does not seem to be working, analysts say. One problem they note is that Microsoft introduced Xbox 360 before there was much game software to play on it. That makes the Xbox 360 less attractive next to the vastly larger number of games available for PlayStation. Microsoft says more games are in the pipeline, including the latest version of the popular Dead or Alive, which is supposed to go on sale here later this month. \"We didn't have a rocket start,\" said Asako Miyata, a spokeswoman in Japan for Microsoft. \"But we see sales steadily picking up as more games become available.\" Analysts say, however, that even when more games appear, Microsoft may have trouble luring first-time buyers because of the need to replace their game software libraries. Because so many consumers now own PlayStation 2, it would be easier for them to wait for the arrival of PlayStation 3, which would be able to play all their current games, . \"Sony has such a high penetration rate,\" said John Yang, an electronics analyst in Tokyo for Standard & Poor's rating agency. \"It is not uncommon for households here to have two or even three PS2's,\" he said, referring to the current PlayStation model. \"Why would an entire household want to switch to Xbox?\" Takashi Sudo, a manager for the video game department at the Yodobashi Camera store, said several hundred people showed up for the opening day of Xbox 360 at his store. But he said he expected a crowd at least five times as large for the PlayStation 3 debut in the spring. For that, he says, he will need to set up a line of special booths to handle the crunch. \"This is Sony's country,\" Mr. Sudo said. \"Xbox has to break into a market that Sony built.\""

                "SANTA MONICA, Calif., July 10 — As Microsoft executives played down the impact of an extensive repair program for defective Xbox 360 game machines, they announced several efforts to broaden the appeal of their machine to families.  Opening the annual E3 game conference here, Microsoft executives announced a deal to distribute films from the Walt Disney Company on Microsoft’s Xbox Live Internet service and outlined a broader array of games focused mostly on children and families.  Executives predicted that the company’s recently announced plan to spend up to $1.15 billion to fix defective Xbox 360 game machine would improve, not undermine, the system’s image with consumers.   “The important impact for us is that our customers know we’re going to support the console and support them and if they have issues, we’ll take care of it,” said Robert J. Bach, president of Microsoft’s entertainment and devices division, in an interview. “It won’t change what’s happening in the marketplace because the industry is about the games and we think we have the games that will get people really excited this year.”  As the game industry’s growth has slowed in recent years, game developers have tried to reach beyond the young male players who have been the target audience.  “We believe we have the best game lineup in video-game history for the holiday season,” said Mr. Bach. “You can look top to bottom and we think we have the goods to please any type of gamer.”  Part of Microsoft’s strategy has been to position the Xbox 360 as a living room media hub and an essential element of that plan has been allowing users to download films and television shows to the machine. Adding Disney to the roster of companies distributing movies and video programming over the Xbox Live service should help broaden the appeal of the game system to families with children. The same could be said of the new games Microsoft announced here, including a new installment of the company’s Viva Pinata game and a version of the Scene It? board game. Scene It? will come with a new controller for the Xbox 360 with large buttons and a simple layout that game novices, intimidated by a traditional game controller, may find easier to use “Part of our strategy is we want to win this generation and in order to do that we have to expand beyond the core gamer audience that we’ve had success with and that means appealing to the broad consumer market,” said Shane Kim, general manager of Microsoft Game Studios. The company also said it was developing a keyboard for the Xbox 360 controller. Currently, Xbox Live users send text messages using an on-screen keyboard. The company recently announced plans to integrate the popular Windows Live Messenger service with Xbox Live.  But even as Microsoft hopes to appeal to new sorts of users, the company wants to avoid neglecting the serious player. So Microsoft also said that the next version of the popular Resident Evil series from Capcom of Japan would also be designed to run on the Xbox 360.   In the past, Resident Evil games have run only on Nintendo and Sony consoles. Persuading Capcom to develop games for the Xbox 360 underlines the success Microsoft has had recently in attracting Japanese developers who had shied away from the American console. "

                "AFTER a 31-year-old Manhattan financial executive received Microsoft's Xbox video game system as a gift in January, he walked to a store and bought a half-dozen game titles. The video game industry would have been pleased to hear it. After he played those games a few times against computer-controlled opponents, he got a bit bored and signed up for Microsoft's Xbox Live service, which enabled him to play against other people online. The video game industry, again, would have been pleased. After a few months on the Xbox Live network, in May, he got a bit bored again. This time, however, he opened his Xbox and soldered in a chip that allowed him to change the console's basic computer code and bypass its internal security technology. After installing a new hard drive, he transferred about 3,000 MP3 music files to the system and downloaded illegal copies of 3,500 old-time arcade games. Then he installed the Linux operating system, which allowed him to use the box essentially as a personal computer. Needless to say, the video game industry would not have been pleased. When Microsoft released the Xbox in November 2001, it was heralded as far more than a game machine. Even as the Xbox took aim at Sony's PlayStation 2 game empire, the console was meant to lead Microsoft's broader invasion of the living room. Incorporating a hard drive, which made it more readily adaptable than other consoles, the Xbox had the potential to be a digital-entertainment nerve center. Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, said at the time, ''We're going to put new software that runs on Xbox that, both in the gaming dimension and other dimensions, will amaze people with the power that's in this box.'' That is happening, but not necessarily as Microsoft planned. All sorts of new software is indeed running on Xbox consoles these days, and they are in fact becoming home-entertainment hubs, but it is not Microsoft doing the amazing. Rather, an online confederacy apparently numbering in the thousands -- including accomplished hackers of varied motives and everyday technophiles like the Manhattan financial executive (who shared his experience on the condition of anonymity) -- is taking the lead. Those involved often call their efforts ''unleashing'' or ''unshackling'' -- freeing the Xbox to express its inner PC. Technology industry executives, however, often call such activity a bald attempt to hijack the Xbox illegally. It is a battle that involves many of the ethical and legal issues facing the technology and media industries at this digital moment. What rights do consumers have to tinker with products they own? How far should companies go to protect their intellectual property? What happens when the desires of consumers conflict with the business models of companies they patronize? Who gets to decide just what a particular product may be used for? The Xbox is a particularly attractive target for hackers because while it is essentially a standard PC modified to do only a few things, like play Xbox games, it is much cheaper than a PC. It is like an economy car modified to follow only a few roads -- but one potentially as powerful as a far more expensive model. In the Xbox, that power comes in the form of a 733-megahertz Intel processor, comparable to a midrange personal computer, and sophisticated graphics and audio systems. Its limited operating system, based on a version of Windows, can be used by a programmer to run simple software like a music player -- or the machine can run a new operating system altogether, namely Linux. ''The reality is that if you could bypass Microsoft's operating system you would end up with a fairly powerful computer for less than $200,'' the Manhattan financial executive said. In fact, Microsoft lowered the price for Xbox to $179.99 in May. In a sense, Xbox hackers are exploiting Microsoft's business model, which is to sell Xbox hardware at a loss (to build penetration of the system) and make the money back on royalties from the sale of Xbox software. A PC manufacturer like Dell, meanwhile, has to recoup its costs and generate a profit from the initial sale. So someone who buys the Xbox hardware, modifies it into a general-purpose computer and does not buy Xbox games potentially undermines not only Microsoft but also the personal computer industry. But that is not how some Xbox hackers think about it. ''Especially in Europe, computers are more expensive than they are here, and the Xbox is the cheapest computer you can get,'' Andrew Huang, author of a new book called ''Hacking the Xbox: An Introduction to Reverse Engineering,'' said in a telephone interview. ''Basically,'' he added by e-mail, ''once you have Linux, you have everything.'' It is unclear just how many Xbox hackers there are. Officials of the Interactive Digital Software Association, a trade group of video game publishers, said that Xbox hacking appeared more prevalent in parts of Asia than in North America. Michael Steil, a 24-year-old German who is project leader of a group that calls itself the Xbox Linux Project, said by e-mail that a full version of Linux software for the Xbox had been downloaded more than 220,000 times. Whatever the numbers, Microsoft does not appear eager to discuss Xbox hacking. In recent weeks, a Microsoft public relations representative repeatedly declined to make any company executives available to discuss the matter. Instead, the company issued a statement through a public relations firm that said in part: ''Microsoft is a company passionate about innovation and creativity. We are also very committed to respect for others' intellectual property and we request the same respect applied to our innovations.'' The statement made no reference to the potential use of hacked Xbox consoles as personal computers, saying Microsoft's ''primary concern'' was with the sale of modified chips for the boxes ''that enable game counterfeiting.'' And that is the area that most clearly raises legal issues. Although there are several methods, hacking an Xbox typically involves obtaining a special chip called a modchip, available on the Internet, and soldering it into the machine. (For those who find the process daunting, there are also vendors on the Internet who sell ''pre-modded'' Xbox units.) Modchips, of which there are several varieties, allow users to load new versions of the basic computer code, known as the BIOS, that tells the machine how to operate. A hacked BIOS generally incorporates modified versions of copyrighted Microsoft code and so is generally illegal. The main Web sites that deal with Xbox hacking do not include links to hacked BIOS, and hackers generally find their forbidden fruit in Internet chat rooms. Once the modchip is installed and the BIOS modified, the console can do a number of things it cannot do ''out of the box.'' Xbox games normally must be run from an optical disk, and a hacked Xbox can ''back up'' a game to the unit's hard drive and run the game without the disk. This technique could be used simply to avoid having to insert and remove disks -- or it could be used for piracy (say, by renting a game, putting the software on the hard drive and returning the game). Until passage of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act in 1998, the mere sale of a modified chip would not have appeared illegal. That law, however, prohibits the sale of devices that are primarily meant to circumvent copyright protection. Companies and technologists will fight over the exact legal meaning of those provisions for years. For now, however, the software industry is relying on them. ''Our view over all on modchips is that they are illegal infringing devices, that where we find people engaged in the widespread manufacturing and distribution of them, we and our members, individually and collectively, are committed to doing what we can to shut down their manufacturing and go after the distributors,'' said Doug Lowenstein, president of the Interactive Digital Software Association. Some advocates, however, say that while software piracy is illegal and morally offensive, the mere act of modifying hardware should not be illegal. ''The most important dimension of this debate from our view is that people should have the right to tinker with the stuff that they own,'' said Fred von Lohmann, senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a civil-liberties group in San Francisco. ''Others will say that this is about piracy and all that, but they forget that the principle of tinkering with the stuff that you own was the principle on which the entire personal computer industry was founded,'' he added. ''This is basic business and basic science in the technology world and we think that this right to tinker, this freedom to tinker, remains legally protected.'' For now, however, the federal government seems to agree with Mr. Lowenstein. Last December, David M. Rocci, a 22-year-old from Blacksburg, Va., pleaded guilty to a federal charge of conspiring to import, market and sell modchips for the Xbox. In April, he was sentenced to five months in prison and five months of home detention. Simply from the standpoint of accessibility, the PlayStation 2 would seem to be a more likely candidate for hacking. IDG, the technology research firm, estimates that at the end of last year, 38.1 million PlayStation 2 units were in use in Europe, North America and Japan combined, compared with 6.7 million Xbox units in those regions. In one sense, however, the hacking scene for PlayStation 2 is less developed than the one for Xbox because there is less appetite for it. Sony sells an official conversion kit for the PlayStation 2 that includes a hard drive and allows that system to run the Linux operating system, which in turn allows the system to run MP3's, movies, spreadsheets or any other program or data that works under Linux. It is relatively easy for Sony to embrace Linux because Sony, unlike Microsoft, is not in the operating system business. The PlayStation 2 hacking community seems focused on developing chips that allow PlayStation 2 units to run illegal copies of games and games meant for far-flung parts of the world. (For marketing reasons, many PlayStation 2 games include regional coding, much as DVD's do.) In 2001, Sony sued an Australian for selling modchips that allowed Australian PlayStation 2 units to play games from other parts of the world. After the Australian government argued on the man's behalf, however, the Federal Court of Australia last July ruled mostly against Sony. Mr. von Lohmann said that Microsoft had not been particularly aggressive in combating Xbox hackers but that Sony had actively fought them. A Sony spokeswoman did not respond this week to requests for comment about the company's approach to hackers. For its part, Microsoft, through its public relations agency, indicated that it believed Xbox hackers were a relatively small band. ''Aside from a set of hobbyists,'' it said, ''the vast majority of Xbox owners are not focused on this niche.'' But those who are appear quite focused indeed. By e-mail, Mr. Steil, the German leader of the Xbox Linux project, declared: ''In very simple words: The Xbox is cheaper than a PC. The Xbox is a lot smaller than a PC. The Xbox looks better (next to a TV set). The Xbox is more silent. Therefore it's an ideal Linux computer in the living room.'' That was probably not the vision Mr. Gates had in mind."

                "WHEN the dust finally settled on the 2006 holiday buying season, American consumers — who braved long lines, cold weather and possibly a few kicks to the shins — had spent $3.7 billion on new video-game consoles and software. And while the more than two million youngsters (and not-so-youngsters) who discovered a next-generation gaming system under the Christmas tree — a Microsoft Xbox 360, a Sony PlayStation 3 or a Nintendo Wii — represent a substantial user base for these platforms, they mean even more to the entertainment industry as a whole. To the makers of these video-game systems and to a growing number of film and television studios, they represent a significant new audience for full-length movies and television shows that can be downloaded directly to gaming consoles. In late November Microsoft began expanding the library on its Xbox Live network, a broadband service available by subscription to Xbox 360 owners. In addition to the video-game trailers and playable demonstrations that the network has traditionally offered, you can now find an eclectically selected collection of films and television shows offered for downloading to a console’s hard drive: for a few dollars you can view “Mission: Impossible III” or “Chinatown” or the episode of “Chappelle’s Show” with the blind white supremacist, on your television, just as if you were watching a DVD or a video-on-demand channel.  For gamers with top-shelf home-theater setups, Xbox Live also offers content in high definition: download the HD version of the “Star Trek” episode “Mirror, Mirror,” in which the Enterprise crew is accidentally beamed into a malevolent alternate reality, and you can practically count each strand of hair in evil Mr. Spock’s goatee. This month XBox Live will offer a new view of the corpulent form of Eric Cartman when it becomes the first outlet ever to offer an episode of “South Park” in high definition. While Microsoft acknowledges that most consumers are buying Xbox 360s primarily, if not solely, to play video games, the company also sees an opportunity to use film and television content to draw an audience that doesn’t fit the stereotypical gamer profile.  “The original Xbox was probably the domain of that testosterone-fueled male in the household, and while we love him to death, we also want his little brother and sister and mom and dad and their friends to be able to enjoy it,” said Peter Moore, corporate vice president of Microsoft’s interactive entertainment business division.  To that end Microsoft spent several months negotiating with Hollywood studios and television networks, including Warner Brothers, Paramount, CBS and MTV, to secure a broad variety of programming before rolling out the expanded Xbox Live service.  Although more than 4.5 million Xbox 360s have been sold, and some 60 percent of owners are connected to Xbox Live, the network’s audience will not make broadcast television or movie theaters obsolete any time soon. Yet the kind of content most abundantly available on the network — goofy comedies like “Nacho Libre” and “Zoolander,” clips of Nascar races and adventure films like “Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior” — clearly indicates whom Microsoft expects to make the most use of it: men in their 20s and 30s with enough disposable income to buy lots of video games.  “This guy is typically not going to the movies, and more often than not he’s not watching television, he’s playing games in the living room,” Mr. Moore said. “He’s a difficult person to get to in the first place.”  It is Xbox Live’s potential to deliver such a narrowly defined and increasingly difficult-to-reach demographic that makes it so enticing to the entertainment industry. “This is, to a large extent, an entirely new audience for us,” said Steve Beeks, the president of Lionsgate, an independent studio whose library includes horror movies like “The Descent” and the “Saw” franchise and which recently announced it would make its films available for download on Xbox Live. “These are active buyers of games, but we don’t believe they’ve been active buyers of movies. We’re turning them into consumers of films.”  For television networks whose programming appears on the service, Xbox Live offers the additional benefit of a precise metric to determine how many gamers are downloading their shows and how many are then seeking out these shows on broadcast television.  “We’re gauging how different clips translate into what kind of pickup in viewership we get and what kind of buzz we’re getting on the blogs,” said Dennis Quinn, Turner Broadcasting’s executive vice president for business development. “If they’re watching a six-minute clip of ‘Robot Chicken,’ is that translating into a greater sampling of the network show? If we see older shows like ‘Harvey Birdman’ picking up again, what does that mean for people who produce the content?” At least one of Microsoft’s competitors is also preparing to enter this digital arena. Sony’s PlayStation 3, which comes with the ability to play high-definition Blu-ray DVDs, also allows gamers to connect to Sony’s own broadband network. Right now that network doesn’t offer much more than video-game demos and movie trailers, but that will soon change.  “As long as you’re downloading a trailer, what’s to stop us from offering the entire program, whether it’s a movie or a TV show?” said Peter Dille, the senior vice president for marketing for Sony Computer Entertainment America. “Being part of Sony Corporation, with a film entertainment company as a sister company and a music company at arm’s length, the world is our oyster in many respects.” For the moment Nintendo has no immediate plans to make film and television programming available for its Wii game console, which also lets gamers connect to an Internet-based network of content channels. But the company did not rule out the possibility.  “There’s a lot of plans we have for the channels,” said Perrin Kaplan, Nintendo’s vice president for marketing. “And there are ways that they could be used that we haven’t yet really conceived of.” Though Microsoft is the only gaming company to provide a substantial content library (roughly 100 movies and several hundred television episodes so far), some gamers feel the offerings are too limited to encourage them to use the feature regularly.  “Until you feel like it’s a pretty comprehensive list where you can look up just about anything, it’s not a service that I think most people will use,” said Dan Hsu, editor in chief of Electronic Gaming Monthly magazine. “You can just go, ‘Well, maybe I’ll check the iTunes music store or nbc.com and see if they have the shows that I want.’ ”  Other industry executives say the current push to provide entertainment content has more to do with satisfying console manufacturers’ needs than with fulfilling gamers’ demands.  “For this round of consoles it makes total sense that they have to focus on entertainment,” said Ricardo Sanchez, an executive at GameTap, a service that lets subscribers play console and arcade games on their personal computers. “For Sony I’ve got to believe the PS3 is as much about establishing Blu-ray as it is about selling games. On the Microsoft side they’re betting so much on Xbox Live that they’ll do practically anything to drive awareness and interest in it.”  At the same time, Mr. Sanchez said, “I don’t see them spending a lot of effort, beyond just aggregating content you can get elsewhere.”  Most gamers understand that in exchange for the ability to watch “South Park” reruns on demand, they are giving the console makers something: a valuable piece of real estate in their home-theater cabinets that a DVD player or stereo receiver might otherwise occupy. That bargain is especially precious for Microsoft, which is still better known as a monolithic software company than a trusted manufacturer of home electronics.  “This is following years of Bill Gates wanting to pursue something around a set-top box,” said Josh Larson, the director of the video-game Web site GameSpot.com. “It’s kind of a Trojan horse into the living room.” But as media ploys go, Mr. Larson would rather download his movies from Xbox Live than from PC-based services like Movielink or Amazon.com’s Unbox. “Is it more likely for a gamer that you’re going to download from iTunes and hook your PC up to your TV set?” he asked. “Or a couple button-pushes and you’re watching it in a way that you’re used to watching that content? I think that’s pretty powerful.” Despite the enduring perception that his company is seeking to conquer the universe, Mr. Moore said Microsoft was looking only to provide an audience of savvy, affluent media consumers with the kind of products they want in the way they’ve grown accustomed to consuming them. “In my case,” he said, “I very rarely watch live television anymore. Shows like ‘Lost,’ I’ll wait for the DVD, thank you, rather than have to see it chopped up into five-minute increments with four minutes of commercials. In today’s world we don’t have appointment viewing anymore.” More recently, Mr. Moore said, he was looking to catch up on some recent episodes of “CSI” — in high-definition, preferably — and sure enough, the only place he could find them was on Xbox Live. “I live in Seattle,” he explained, “and I have DirecTV. They don’t put the local networks on in high-def.”"

                "Owners of Microsoft's Xbox 360 game console will soon be able to watch science fiction epics as well as play them. Microsoft said last night that it would offer movies and episodes of television shows for downloading through its Xbox Live online service in the United States, starting Nov. 22. With the new offerings, Microsoft is joining cable giants and Internet start-ups on the long list of companies hoping to profit from video downloading. But Internet-based services have had trouble getting traction because it can be complex to send a downloaded film to a television screen and frustrating to watch it on the small screen of a computer. Owners of the Xbox have already connected it to a TV and, in most cases, the Internet. \"What makes this big is that there's no PC in the middle,\" said Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group. Microsoft has negotiated the rights to rent or sell more than 1,000 hours of material from CBS, MTV Networks, Paramount, Warner Brothers and Turner Broadcasting, along with the martial arts show \"Ultimate Fighting Championship.\" Some programs will be available in high-definition video. The video store will work much like that of Apple Computer, with some important differences. While users will be able to keep television shows, movies can be rented for only a limited period. The videos will not be playable on other devices and cannot be burned onto DVDs, but the online service will keep track of purchases so that users can log in to watch their videos on a friend's Xbox. Peter Moore, Microsoft's corporate vice president for interactive entertainment, said that the price of standard-definition videos would be comparable to what competitors charged. Apple's iTunes charges $1.99 for an episode of a television program. High-definition content will cost more, Mr. Moore said, because of the costs involved in storing it and making it available for downloading. Purchases will be made with points that users can buy with a credit card or a gift certificate, or win in contests. Mr. Moore said the service was partly intended to make the Xbox more versatile and therefore more attractive. \"Direct revenue from this over the long term could be important,\" Mr. Moore said. \"But this is also another reason to buy an Xbox 360.\" New game consoles from Sony and Nintendo are due out this month, a year after the Xbox 360 went on sale, so extra features could help Microsoft keep up in the marketplace. Nintendo is concentrating on game play, but Sony says it also has other content in mind. \"We haven't announced any content besides games,\" said Dave Karraker, a spokesman for Sony Computer Entertainment America, \"but all the executives have said that downloading other entertainment content is something the PlayStation 3 is capable of doing.\" Judging by the initial offerings, Xbox Live will be something of a cyberspace version of the Spike Channel, MTV Networks' cable channel aimed at young men. It will sell episodes of \"Star Trek,\" remastered in high definition, as well as the \"C.S.I.\" shows, some music videos and cartoons from the Cartoon Network's \"Adult Swim.\" \"The interesting thing is that we're delivering the 18-to-34-year-olds who aren't watching TV,\" Mr. Moore said. Microsoft has sold more than two million Xbox 360 consoles in the United States, according to the NPD Group, a market research firm. Most of those who buy the machines sign up for the Xbox Live service, which requires broadband Internet access and allows users to compete against each other. Since the introduction of the Xbox 360 last year, the service has also sold simple video games and other material. This year, Microsoft started to hint at its ambitions for the Xbox Live service when it purchased a company that places advertising in video games and made an ad deal with Cadillac. In the last few years, Microsoft has been pushing the idea of Media Center PCs, which are meant to sit in the living room and supply music and video to the stereo and the television set. But the concept has not caught on, in part because of the complexity of setting up and using these systems. Mr. Enderle said that apart from simplicity, another feature that would set the XBox Live service apart is that it will be the first service to sell downloadable movies in high definition, at a resolution similar to or better than a DVD. Until now, he said, most studios have been reluctant to allow cable channels to show movies in high definition for fear of piracy, but that would be less of a threat on XBox Live. Early next year, Apple plans to introduce a product that, on a preliminary basis, it is calling iTV and that is intended to be a bridge between the computer and the television set. But Microsoft will go into the video business with a different business model. Apple, most analysts maintain, does not make much money selling iTunes content, but makes up for that by selling more iPods, which are extremely profitable. Microsoft, which analysts say loses money on each Xbox 360 it sells, expects to make up for that by selling games -- and now video. \"This is a razors-and-blades business,\" Mr. Moore said. \"I've taken the hit on the razor. And the ability of Microsoft to offer more blades gives consumers more choice and drives more revenue.\" The video downloads, especially those in high definition, will take up a lot of space. Microsoft says a one-hour television program in high definition will take up about 2 gigabytes of the console's standard 20-gigabyte hard drive. Microsoft says the Xbox will play both movies and TV shows as they are being downloaded, although with larger files there will be a delay before playback starts, in contrast to the video-on-demand services offered by cable companies. High-definition movies will take an especially long while, depending on the speed of the Internet connection. Editors' Note: November 10, 2006, Friday An article in Business Day on Tuesday described a decision by Microsoft to offer movies and episodes of television shows for downloading through its Xbox Live online service in the United States. The article quoted Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group, discussing the features that set Xbox Live service apart and its position in the market. But the article did not note that Mr. Enderle had Microsoft as a client, a fact later pointed out by a reader. Mr. Enderle does consulting work for several of Microsoft's product groups, though not for the one developing the Xbox; still, had The Times known of Mr. Enderle's work for Microsoft, it would not have sought out his opinion on the product."

                "TOKYO — Microsoft is expected to slash the price of its Xbox 360 game console in Japan by about 30 percent, below the price of Nintendo's Wii and Sony's PlayStation 3 as it tries to increase its market share, a newspaper reported Monday. Demand for the Xbox 360 has been tepid in Japan, mainly due to a lack of popular games. In contrast, the market-leading Wii is thriving on a range of innovative software, prompting Nintendo to raise its earning forecast Friday. Hiroshi Kamide, a KBC Securities analyst, said a price cut alone is unlikely to trigger a jump in demand for the Xbox 360 and Microsoft needs to focus more on producing attractive software. \"Popular software is now serving as a tail wind to Xbox sales,\" he said. \"Even if they slash the console price, that would not directly boost sales unless they release more good software.\" Robust demand for Namco Bandai's \"Tales of Vesperia\" role-playing game helped Xbox 360's Japanese sales in the week ended Aug. 10. beat the PlayStation 3 for the first time. Microsoft will lower the price of the Xbox 360 Arcade model by ¥8,000 to ¥19,800, or about $180, the Nikkei business daily said. The Arcade does not come equipped with a hard drive and is the least expensive of the three Xbox 360 models. The company has already cut the price in the United States, Europe and four Asian markets as it tries to grab a larger chunk of the $57 billion game industry. The new price will make that model cheaper than Nintendo's Wii, which sells for about ¥25,000 yen, and the PlayStation 3, which sells for ¥39,800. The Wii's success has been attributed to inventive titles like the \"Wii Fit\" exercise game, its low price and its easy-to-learn motion-sensing controller. Microsoft will also reduce the price of two more expensive models with hard drives by ¥5,000 to ¥8,000, the paper said. Kazumi Ishiyama, a Microsoft Xbox spokeswoman in Japan, declined to comment on the Nikkei report. The company is scheduled to hold a briefing on the Xbox 360 in the Japanese market Monday afternoon. In Europe, the Xbox 360 Arcade model already costs less than the Wii. The Xbox 360 has lagged its Japanese rivals on their home turf, with 684,695 units sold so far in Japan against Wii's 6.67 million and PlayStation 3's 2.32 million, according to the game magazine publisher Enterbrain. The Xbox 360 was introduced about a year before its rivals."

                "AFTER a 31-year-old Manhattan financial executive received Microsoft's Xbox video game system as a gift in January, he walked to a store and bought a half-dozen game titles. The video game industry would have been pleased to hear it. After he played those games a few times against computer-controlled opponents, he got a bit bored and signed up for Microsoft's Xbox Live service, which enabled him to play against other people online. The video game industry, again, would have been pleased. After a few months on the Xbox Live network, in May, he got a bit bored again. This time, however, he opened his Xbox and soldered in a chip that allowed him to change the console's basic computer code and bypass its internal security technology. After installing a new hard drive, he transferred about 3,000 MP3 music files to the system and downloaded illegal copies of 3,500 old-time arcade games. Then he installed the Linux operating system, which allowed him to use the box essentially as a personal computer. Needless to say, the video game industry would not have been pleased. When Microsoft released the Xbox in November 2001, it was heralded as far more than a game machine. Even as the Xbox took aim at Sony's PlayStation 2 game empire, the console was meant to lead Microsoft's broader invasion of the living room. Incorporating a hard drive, which made it more readily adaptable than other consoles, the Xbox had the potential to be a digital-entertainment nerve center. Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, said at the time, ''We're going to put new software that runs on Xbox that, both in the gaming dimension and other dimensions, will amaze people with the power that's in this box.'' That is happening, but not necessarily as Microsoft planned. All sorts of new software is indeed running on Xbox consoles these days, and they are in fact becoming home-entertainment hubs, but it is not Microsoft doing the amazing. Rather, an online confederacy apparently numbering in the thousands -- including accomplished hackers of varied motives and everyday technophiles like the Manhattan financial executive (who shared his experience on the condition of anonymity) -- is taking the lead. Those involved often call their efforts ''unleashing'' or ''unshackling'' -- freeing the Xbox to express its inner PC. Technology industry executives, however, often call such activity a bald attempt to hijack the Xbox illegally. It is a battle that involves many of the ethical and legal issues facing the technology and media industries at this digital moment. What rights do consumers have to tinker with products they own? How far should companies go to protect their intellectual property? What happens when the desires of consumers conflict with the business models of companies they patronize? Who gets to decide just what a particular product may be used for? The Xbox is a particularly attractive target for hackers because while it is essentially a standard PC modified to do only a few things, like play Xbox games, it is much cheaper than a PC. It is like an economy car modified to follow only a few roads -- but one potentially as powerful as a far more expensive model. In the Xbox, that power comes in the form of a 733-megahertz Intel processor, comparable to a midrange personal computer, and sophisticated graphics and audio systems. Its limited operating system, based on a version of Windows, can be used by a programmer to run simple software like a music player -- or the machine can run a new operating system altogether, namely Linux. ''The reality is that if you could bypass Microsoft's operating system you would end up with a fairly powerful computer for less than $200,'' the Manhattan financial executive said. In fact, Microsoft lowered the price for Xbox to $179.99 in May. In a sense, Xbox hackers are exploiting Microsoft's business model, which is to sell Xbox hardware at a loss (to build penetration of the system) and make the money back on royalties from the sale of Xbox software. A PC manufacturer like Dell, meanwhile, has to recoup its costs and generate a profit from the initial sale. So someone who buys the Xbox hardware, modifies it into a general-purpose computer and does not buy Xbox games potentially undermines not only Microsoft but also the personal computer industry. But that is not how some Xbox hackers think about it. ''Especially in Europe, computers are more expensive than they are here, and the Xbox is the cheapest computer you can get,'' Andrew Huang, author of a new book called ''Hacking the Xbox: An Introduction to Reverse Engineering,'' said in a telephone interview. ''Basically,'' he added by e-mail, ''once you have Linux, you have everything.'' It is unclear just how many Xbox hackers there are. Officials of the Interactive Digital Software Association, a trade group of video game publishers, said that Xbox hacking appeared more prevalent in parts of Asia than in North America. Michael Steil, a 24-year-old German who is project leader of a group that calls itself the Xbox Linux Project, said by e-mail that a full version of Linux software for the Xbox had been downloaded more than 220,000 times. Whatever the numbers, Microsoft does not appear eager to discuss Xbox hacking. In recent weeks, a Microsoft public relations representative repeatedly declined to make any company executives available to discuss the matter. Instead, the company issued a statement through a public relations firm that said in part: ''Microsoft is a company passionate about innovation and creativity. We are also very committed to respect for others' intellectual property and we request the same respect applied to our innovations.'' The statement made no reference to the potential use of hacked Xbox consoles as personal computers, saying Microsoft's ''primary concern'' was with the sale of modified chips for the boxes ''that enable game counterfeiting.'' And that is the area that most clearly raises legal issues. Although there are several methods, hacking an Xbox typically involves obtaining a special chip called a modchip, available on the Internet, and soldering it into the machine. (For those who find the process daunting, there are also vendors on the Internet who sell ''pre-modded'' Xbox units.) Modchips, of which there are several varieties, allow users to load new versions of the basic computer code, known as the BIOS, that tells the machine how to operate. A hacked BIOS generally incorporates modified versions of copyrighted Microsoft code and so is generally illegal. The main Web sites that deal with Xbox hacking do not include links to hacked BIOS, and hackers generally find their forbidden fruit in Internet chat rooms. Once the modchip is installed and the BIOS modified, the console can do a number of things it cannot do ''out of the box.'' Xbox games normally must be run from an optical disk, and a hacked Xbox can ''back up'' a game to the unit's hard drive and run the game without the disk. This technique could be used simply to avoid having to insert and remove disks -- or it could be used for piracy (say, by renting a game, putting the software on the hard drive and returning the game). Until passage of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act in 1998, the mere sale of a modified chip would not have appeared illegal. That law, however, prohibits the sale of devices that are primarily meant to circumvent copyright protection. Companies and technologists will fight over the exact legal meaning of those provisions for years. For now, however, the software industry is relying on them. ''Our view over all on modchips is that they are illegal infringing devices, that where we find people engaged in the widespread manufacturing and distribution of them, we and our members, individually and collectively, are committed to doing what we can to shut down their manufacturing and go after the distributors,'' said Doug Lowenstein, president of the Interactive Digital Software Association. Some advocates, however, say that while software piracy is illegal and morally offensive, the mere act of modifying hardware should not be illegal. ''The most important dimension of this debate from our view is that people should have the right to tinker with the stuff that they own,'' said Fred von Lohmann, senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a civil-liberties group in San Francisco. ''Others will say that this is about piracy and all that, but they forget that the principle of tinkering with the stuff that you own was the principle on which the entire personal computer industry was founded,'' he added. ''This is basic business and basic science in the technology world and we think that this right to tinker, this freedom to tinker, remains legally protected.'' For now, however, the federal government seems to agree with Mr. Lowenstein. Last December, David M. Rocci, a 22-year-old from Blacksburg, Va., pleaded guilty to a federal charge of conspiring to import, market and sell modchips for the Xbox. In April, he was sentenced to five months in prison and five months of home detention. Simply from the standpoint of accessibility, the PlayStation 2 would seem to be a more likely candidate for hacking. IDG, the technology research firm, estimates that at the end of last year, 38.1 million PlayStation 2 units were in use in Europe, North America and Japan combined, compared with 6.7 million Xbox units in those regions. In one sense, however, the hacking scene for PlayStation 2 is less developed than the one for Xbox because there is less appetite for it. Sony sells an official conversion kit for the PlayStation 2 that includes a hard drive and allows that system to run the Linux operating system, which in turn allows the system to run MP3's, movies, spreadsheets or any other program or data that works under Linux. It is relatively easy for Sony to embrace Linux because Sony, unlike Microsoft, is not in the operating system business. The PlayStation 2 hacking community seems focused on developing chips that allow PlayStation 2 units to run illegal copies of games and games meant for far-flung parts of the world. (For marketing reasons, many PlayStation 2 games include regional coding, much as DVD's do.) In 2001, Sony sued an Australian for selling modchips that allowed Australian PlayStation 2 units to play games from other parts of the world. After the Australian government argued on the man's behalf, however, the Federal Court of Australia last July ruled mostly against Sony. Mr. von Lohmann said that Microsoft had not been particularly aggressive in combating Xbox hackers but that Sony had actively fought them. A Sony spokeswoman did not respond this week to requests for comment about the company's approach to hackers. For its part, Microsoft, through its public relations agency, indicated that it believed Xbox hackers were a relatively small band. ''Aside from a set of hobbyists,'' it said, ''the vast majority of Xbox owners are not focused on this niche.'' But those who are appear quite focused indeed. By e-mail, Mr. Steil, the German leader of the Xbox Linux project, declared: ''In very simple words: The Xbox is cheaper than a PC. The Xbox is a lot smaller than a PC. The Xbox looks better (next to a TV set). The Xbox is more silent. Therefore it's an ideal Linux computer in the living room.'' That was probably not the vision Mr. Gates had in mind."

                "Users of Microsoft’s popular Xbox Kinect gaming console will soon be able to use voice and motion commands to interact with advertisements while they are playing their favorite game or watching a video. On Tuesday, Microsoft is set to announce a new suite of advertising tools, called NUads, short for natural user-interface ads, that will let users interact with advertising on the console dashboard or embedded in games and other video content. The ads use the same voice and motion control developed for the company’s Kinect game console, which it introduced in time for the 2010 holiday season.  The new ads are intended to help advertisers keep the attention of Xbox users in a way that traditional television advertising does not.  “When you have highly interactive people and a passive medium, they are interacting with their phone or their laptop while watching TV,” said Mark Kroese, the general manager of the advertising business group at Microsoft. The new ads, Mr. Kroese said, “create a natural way for the user to engage with the TV.”  At least one advertising agency seems to agree.  “The new ad units really epitomized the level of engagement that everyone is working towards,” said John M. Lisko, the executive communications director of Saatchi & Saatchi Los Angeles, part of the Publicis Groupe. Mr. Lisko said the agency had successfully advertised on the Xbox console in the past and was “absolutely considering” the new capabilities. “You can text, you can tweet, you can vote,” he said. “That’s phenomenal.”  Using voice commands, gamers will be able to send messages about an ad to a social networking site like Twitter by saying “Xbox Tweet.” Advertisers who want to send more information about a product or promotion associated with a campaign can prompt Xbox users to say “Xbox More,” which will send users an e-mail with the information they wanted.  For advertising tied to events like television shows, advertisers can prompt a user to say “Xbox Schedule” and the system will send a text message reminder to the user’s mobile phone. Similarly, advertisers can prompt users to say “Xbox Near Me” and a map to the nearest retailer will be sent to their mobile phone. Finally, advertisers can prompt users to vote on a topic by asking the user to wave their hand in front of the console and select their favorite pizza topping, superhero or clothing brand.  The new advertising options will be presented on Tuesday to advertisers at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, an annual conference for advertisers and marketers. Consumers will begin to see the new features in the spring of 2012.  The new ads will be simple for marketers to deploy since they can use the same commercials they would use on television.  “What we’re seeing now is a technology environment where marketers can deliver more sophisticated ads and they don’t have some of the hurdles that in-game marketers and in-game publishers had,” said Paul Verna, a senior analyst at eMarketer. “It’s a level of interactivity that suggests more possibilities than we’ve seen up until now.” "

                "The daughter of a Brazilian Catholic mother and a Palestinian Muslim father, Fatima Shama, 39, grew up in the Bronx, attending Roman Catholic school during the week, Muslim “Sunday school” on Saturdays and church on Sundays. She speaks six languages, which comes in handy for her job as the commissioner of the Mayor’s Office of Immigrant Affairs, a position she has held since 2009. (Recently, her office reached out to immigrant communities affected by Hurricane Sandy to help them navigate government resources and aid.) She lives in Turtle Bay in Manhattan with her husband, Ziad Mansouri, 42, who works at JPMorgan Chase, and their three sons, Samir, 8; Ibrahim, 5; and Omar, 2. She and her husband are raising them as Muslims, with a generous dose of other religious traditions. WAKE-UP CALL My kids tend to wake me up — that’s about 6:30, 7 o’clock. Coffee is absolutely essential. It’s almost the first thing I do. Then we get the Sunday Times. My youngest son loves to be the person to get it for me. INTERNATIONAL BREAKFAST It could be me deciding to make Belgian waffles or pancakes, or it’s possible I’ll make — my kids love an Arabic breakfast food called lebni — basically, strained yogurt, and you eat it with pita bread. And they love an Arabic string cheese and another kind of cheese common to the region called haloumi, a must to every breakfast table in our house OUTSIDE VOICES Sundays are absolutely about family and spending time with our kids. From 11 to 2 is our outside time. We might go ice skating at Wollman Rink, or the Central Park Zoo; we are there a lot and we love it. I think that the kids would probably say the Museum of Natural History is their favorite, just ‘cause of what we get to see. It’s everything from butterflies and frogs and lizards to the dinosaurs or the elephants. And they can be loud and we don’t have to apologize to anybody. Sometimes we’ll do excursions out of the city, or there might be a children’s birthday party or two, given our kids’ social lives. PARADER IN CHIEF If it’s summertime, there’s likely a parade that I might march in or a community event I might stop by. Of course, during the hurricane, every Sunday we were out in the community. But if it’s summertime, rest assured there’s a parade in my future. BOYS’ TIME Our kids are only allowed to play their electronics on the weekends. Our kids got an Xbox for Christmas — I grew up in a dual home, so my kids have the pleasure of learning about their own faith, but also being able to celebrate the faith of my siblings and mother. The Xbox Kinect Dance Central game, I will tell you that is hysterical. I actually love the fact that this Kinect thing helps them jump around. And Sunday football is a big deal. We’re a Giants home, but my sons love the Tampa Bay Buccaneers — their mascot is a pirate, so we think that’s how it started. My oldest son can tell you anything about football. SHOPPING, COOKING I try to cook for the week or make some Sunday dinner for us, so I might run to the supermarket. I love to cook with my kids. My middle son loves to make a Brazilian cheese bread, so we make that a lot. We make black beans and rice, there’s always a pasta night — I do make, actually, a lot of Arabic food. WINDING DOWN Then it’s dinner, bath time and we do reading every night. Our kids are in bed by about 8:30. And it’s my date with “Downton Abbey.” Lady Grantham, the grandmother, I just love her absolutely dry sarcasm and her love of the monarchy and all things traditional. And I try to clean out my e-mail before Monday morning, do what I can do to make life better before Monday morning. FINISHING UP This is actually a very true thing: I basically don’t go to sleep until I finish the paper so I can put it out into the recycling bin. Otherwise it becomes a pile. I actually try to finish all of my Sunday paper and I actually read the paper — Sunday in particular — minus a couple sections, cover to cover. I love holding the paper, but I love the ads. I like to look at the jewelry ads. Even though I could never buy any of it."

                "NEW YORK — Reaching out to millions of aspiring game developers around the world, Microsoft is holding a contest that will award $10,000 and the opportunity to entice millions of viewers to the next great digital diversion for the company's Xbox 360. In addition to the game console's snazzy graphics, the Xbox Live online service has been the most important component of the Xbox 360's success since its debut in 2005. And perhaps the most popular aspect of Xbox Live has been the service's arcade component, which allows users to download and play smaller, relatively simple games like \"Uno\" and \"Geometry Wars\" that usually cost less than $10. (By contrast, top-end games can sell in stores for around $60.) The popularity of Xbox Live Arcade has in turn attracted the attention of game developers looking to create the next \"Tetris\" or \"Minesweeper.\" Late last year, Microsoft introduced a suite of software tools for making so- called casual games called XNA. So at a convention of game makers Monday in San Francisco, Microsoft was to announce a contest that will award a cash prize and a potential slot on Xbox Live Arcade to the best game created with XNA tools. The company intends to announce the winner of the \"Dream-Build-Play\" contest in August. \"This competition highlights the power of XNA and the popularity of the Xbox Live Arcade service, with its millions of users,\" Aaron Greenberg, Microsoft's group product manager for the Xbox 360 and Xbox Live, said by phone. To help increase the popularity of casual games, Microsoft is also introducing a 512-megabyte portable storage device for the Xbox 360. The previous portable storage unit contained only 64 megabytes of data, and so Xbox Live Arcade games had been limited to an official size of 50 megabytes. With the new unit, Microsoft will also raise the official size limit on Xbox Live Arcade games to 150 megabytes, allowing enhanced graphics, sound and artificial intelligence."

                "LOS ANGELES — In what may be one of the costliest consumer warranty repairs in history, Microsoft announced on Thursday that it would spend up to $1.15 billion to repair failing Xbox 360 game machine consoles. While the company would not say how many units were failing, Robbie Bach, president of Microsoft's entertainment and devices division, said that there have been an \"unacceptable high number of repairs.\" The majority of Xbox 360 owners, he said, have not experienced hardware failure. Company officials said that Microsoft had sold 11.6 million Xbox 360 units by the end of June, shy of the 12 million units the company had predicted. The Xbox 360, which first went of sale in November 2005, is currently the best-selling game machine in the United States, according to NPD, a market research firm. The size of the anticipated repair bill suggests that a third to as many as half of the machines are flawed. Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington State, said it would take a charge of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion against earnings in the quarter ended June 30. Consumers know they have a problem if three red flashing lights appear on the console. Gamers on online forums have been referring to the event as \"the Red Ring of Death\" because the machine then shuts down. The company declined to explain the nature of the failure, but said that it was not caused by a single problem in the console, which it said contained 1,700 components and 500 million transistors. The company also said there were no health or safety concerns involved. The problem began to appear over the last three to four months, Bach said, after \"significant usage\" of the consoles. He said the company has taken steps to correct the problem in new devices. Microsoft said it would extend the warranty of the game console to three years to customers worldwide. Previously, products sold in the United States were covered by a one-year warranty, while Xbox 360 units sold in Europe had a two-year warranty. In addition, customers who have had their consoles repaired because of the \"three flashing lights\" problem will be reimbursed for the cost of the repairs. Microsoft has succeeded in establishing the Xbox brand against the better known Sony PlayStation and other game machines. The Xbox and its successor, the Xbox 360, was the software maker's first major foray into hardware. Although sales are small relative to the rest of Microsoft's revenue, the Xbox has been an important venture for the company and was viewed by many analysts as Microsoft's attempt to compete with the likes of Sony and Apple for control of electronics and entertainment within homes. The device can be used to access the Internet and view movies. Microsoft said its entertainment and devices division reported an operating loss of $315 million on $929 million in revenue for the three-month period that ended in March, and analysts have estimated that the company lost about $6 billion getting a foothold in the game machine industry. A new Xbox 360 with a 20-gigabyte hard drive sells for about $400, but other versions cost about $300. The announcement comes on the eve of the E3 Media and Business Summit, the video-game industry's major trade show, to be held next week in Los Angeles. \"This is bound to affect discussions between Microsoft and its developers and retailers,\" said Richard Doherty, a partner in the research company Envisioneering Group."

                "Editors’ Note Appended Owners of Microsoft’s Xbox 360 game console will soon be able to watch science fiction epics as well as play them.  Microsoft said last night that it would offer movies and episodes of television shows for downloading through its Xbox Live online service in the United States, starting Nov. 22.  With the new offerings, Microsoft is joining cable giants and Internet start-ups on the long list of companies hoping to profit from video downloading. But Internet-based services have had trouble getting traction because it can be complex to send a downloaded film to a television screen and frustrating to watch it on the small screen of a computer. Owners of the Xbox have already connected it to a TV and, in most cases, the Internet. “What makes this big is that there’s no PC in the middle,” said Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group. Microsoft has negotiated the rights to rent or sell more than 1,000 hours of material from CBS, MTV Networks, Paramount, Warner Brothers and Turner Broadcasting, along with the martial arts show “Ultimate Fighting Championship.” Some programs will be available in high-definition video. The video store will work much like that of Apple Computer, with some important differences. While users will be able to keep television shows, movies can be rented for only a limited period. The videos will not be playable on other devices and cannot be burned onto DVDs, but the online service will keep track of purchases so that users can log in to watch their videos on a friend’s Xbox.  Peter Moore, Microsoft’s corporate vice president for interactive entertainment, said that the price of standard-definition videos would be comparable to what competitors charged. Apple’s iTunes charges $1.99 for an episode of a television program.  High-definition content will cost more, Mr. Moore said, because of the costs involved in storing it and making it available for downloading. Purchases will be made with points that users can buy with a credit card or a gift certificate, or win in contests.  Mr. Moore said the service was partly intended to make the Xbox more versatile and therefore more attractive. “Direct revenue from this over the long term could be important,” Mr. Moore said. “But this is also another reason to buy an Xbox 360.”  New game consoles from Sony and Nintendo are due out this month, a year after the Xbox 360 went on sale, so extra features could help Microsoft keep up in the marketplace. Nintendo is concentrating on game play, but Sony says it also has other content in mind.  “We haven’t announced any content besides games,” said Dave Karraker, a spokesman for Sony Computer Entertainment America, “but all the executives have said that downloading other entertainment content is something the PlayStation 3 is capable of doing.” Judging by the initial offerings, Xbox Live will be something of a cyberspace version of the Spike Channel, MTV Networks’ cable channel aimed at young men. It will sell episodes of “Star Trek,” remastered in high definition, as well as the “C.S.I.” shows, some music videos and cartoons from the Cartoon Network’s “Adult Swim.”  “The interesting thing is that we’re delivering the 18-to-34-year-olds who aren’t watching TV,” Mr. Moore said. Microsoft has sold more than two million Xbox 360 consoles in the United States, according to the NPD Group, a market research firm. Most of those who buy the machines sign up for the Xbox Live service, which requires broadband Internet access and allows users to compete against each other.  Since the introduction of the Xbox 360 last year, the service has also sold simple video games and other material. This year, Microsoft started to hint at its ambitions for the Xbox Live service when it purchased a company that places advertising in video games and made an ad deal with Cadillac.  In the last few years, Microsoft has been pushing the idea of Media Center PCs, which are meant to sit in the living room and supply music and video to the stereo and the television set. But the concept has not caught on, in part because of the complexity of setting up and using these systems.  Mr. Enderle said that apart from simplicity, another feature that would set the XBox Live service apart is that it will be the first service to sell downloadable movies in high definition, at a resolution similar to or better than a DVD.  Until now, he said, most studios have been reluctant to allow cable channels to show movies in high definition for fear of piracy, but that would be less of a threat on XBox Live.  Early next year, Apple plans to introduce a product that, on a preliminary basis, it is calling iTV and that is intended to be a bridge between the computer and the television set. But Microsoft will go into the video business with a different business model. Apple, most analysts maintain, does not make much money selling iTunes content, but makes up for that by selling more iPods, which are extremely profitable. Microsoft, which analysts say loses money on each Xbox 360 it sells, expects to make up for that by selling games — and now video.  “This is a razors-and-blades business,” Mr. Moore said. “I’ve taken the hit on the razor. And the ability of Microsoft to offer more blades gives consumers more choice and drives more revenue.”  The video downloads, especially those in high definition, will take up a lot of space. Microsoft says a one-hour television program in high definition will take up about 2 gigabytes of the console’s standard 20-gigabyte hard drive. Microsoft says the Xbox will play both movies and TV shows as they are being downloaded, although with larger files there will be a delay before playback starts, in contrast to the video-on-demand services offered by cable companies. High-definition movies will take an especially long while, depending on the speed of the Internet connection. "

                "It was nearly a decade ago that a young Microsoft programmer named J. Allard sounded the alarm and convinced Bill Gates that the Internet was a threat to the dominance of the Microsoft Windows operating system. On Monday, Microsoft will announce Mr. Allard's next big gamble: an ambitious billion-dollar-plus investment in an online game service to be called Xbox Live. Microsoft hopes to create what it describes as the equivalent of an online Disneyland, globally accessible over the Internet, where gamers who subscribe can find partners for dozens of different adventure, racing and sports games. The company is betting the service will save its Xbox video-game system, which began shipping last November but still lags far behind the industry-leading Sony PlayStation 2, which has nearly 30 million units in use worldwide, compared with only 3.5 million for the Xbox. (There are an estimated four million to five million Nintendo GameCube consoles now in use.) While Sony and Nintendo have online plans, networked game playing is peripheral to their video-game strategies. For Microsoft, it has been integral to the Xbox plan from the beginning -- the wedge with which Microsoft hopes to gain entry to the nation's and world's living rooms and become an entertainment powerhouse. It is a bet as ambitious as it is expensive. When Microsoft opens the electronic doors for its service this summer, the Internet technology in its three data centers in London, Seattle and Tokyo will have more capacity than its own Microsoft.com, which itself is one of the world's largest Web sites. The risk is that Microsoft is entering a quagmire that will soak up vast amounts of investment and lock the company in a bitter, potentially unwinnable battle with Sony and Nintendo, which will each be describing their own online services at this week's game industry convention, the Electronic Entertainment Expo, which starts Wednesday in Los Angeles. For Xbox Live to become a success the company acknowledges that it will have to attract millions of customers willing to pay $50 or more for each game's software and perhaps a $9.95 monthly subscription, in addition to the $40 to $60 a month for the high-speed Internet connection the service will require. Those are big if's, because while video games have become a wildly popular form of home entertainment, online game playing -- so far mainly employing personal computers, not game consoles -- has never appealed to more than a fraction of Internet users, and in almost all cases, only when it is free. Even more daunting is the fact that there is little evidence that video games have expanded much beyond their core audience of adolescent and college-age males. ''Gaming is a very age-specific and demographic-specific device and experience,'' said Mitchell Kertzmann, the chief executive office of Liberate Technologies, an interactive television equipment supplier based in San Carlos, Calif. There have already been well-publicized failures in the online gaming business. During the Internet bubble, start-ups like Total Entertainment Network and MPATH rose and fell on the promise of offering Web game portals for paying PC customers. And Sega, the one video-game company that did start an online service, Sega.net, way back in 2000, has dropped that service and no longer even makes game consoles, now focusing instead on software. ''It only works when you get to significantly high numbers of subscribers,'' said Lawrence Probst, chairman and chief executive officer of Electronic Arts, the largest maker of computer and video-game software. ''We've learned that the hard way with EA.com,'' he said, referring to the company's online computer-game service, whose only profitable component is the medieval-themed Ultima Online, which has about 200,000 subscribers. Another challenge may arise in household geography. In most homes, the video-game console is located in the living room, where the television set is -- nowhere near the high-speed Internet connection in the den. That assumes, of course that the den has a high-speed connection. Microsoft asserts that as many as half of its Xbox customers already have high-speed, or broadband, Internet connections. But so far only 12 percent of the nation's households have broadband Internet, according to Odyssey, a market research firm in San Francisco, and the number is growing only slowly. ''If this service requires broadband, just put it in the icebox for awhile,'' said Nick Donatiello, Odyssey's president. And yet Microsoft's new service does have its defenders, industry executives who think that online gaming can reach a broader audience than stand-alone video games have. ''Microsoft has the resources to make online gaming successful,'' said Charles Bellfield, the vice president for corporate strategy at Sega, which develops games for the Xbox and will offer versions for Xbox Live. ''It may not happen on day one, but by the time gaming reaches the mainstream, it will be doing well.'' Mr. Allard, who is now general manager of Microsoft's Xbox division, argues that Microsoft can create a mass audience by the force of a huge effort and by the company's ability to tap into a latent demand that he said he first detected three years ago. In an interview last week, Mr. Allard recalled the epiphany. While visiting a Seattle video-game arcade with other Xbox designers in 1999 he realized that the longest lines were all formed around the multiplayer games -- the basketball, car racing, tank warfare and other competitions in which players compete on individual or clustered machines. He said he came to believe that it would be the ''social'' experience offered by the Internet that would drive the next major generation of video games. That is why he committed the company to add the $40 to $50 worth of hardware to each Xbox needed to make every console Internet ready. Now Microsoft is ready to tap that built-in capability. On Monday, the company plans to announce that it will begin consumer tests of Xbox Live this summer with a one-year subscription and a headset, for $49, that will enable Xbox owners with high-speed Internet connections to compete and converse with one another online. Despite speculation that the company might use its online network connection to link Xbox users to Microsoft's other services, Mr. Allard insists that Xbox Live will stay focused on gaming. Robert J. Bach, a Microsoft senior vice president in charge of its games division said the company was planning a service that he compared to Disneyland for its safe, wholesome environment -- in contrast to the ''Coney Island'' he said that the open Internet can sometimes become. ''Compare Coney Island to Disneyland,'' he said. ''When you're at Disneyland, there's no trash, no violence and you never see security. That's what we have in mind.'' Mr. Allard invoked to the same metaphor to criticize his biggest competitor's approach. ''I won't deny that I've occasionally referred to Sony's online service as Sony Island,'' Mr. Allard said. Sony, which has said that it will begin selling a $40 adaptor for connecting the PlayStation 2 to the Internet either via dial-up modem or high-speed connection in August, makes no apologies for its approach. Although the company will not attempt to match Microsoft's ambitious online theme-park environment, neither will Sony attempt to charge users for playing its video games online -- at least not initially. If the gaming experiences are comparable for players, a free service based on Sony's market-dominating video-game console could prove an insurmountable rival to Microsoft's fee-based ''walled garden'' approach. Moreover, unlike Microsoft's command-and-control approach to the Xbox Live network, the Sony service will not force independent game publishers to provide their online PlayStation games through Sony's own network. That difference was highlighted when executives at Electronic Arts said last week that they planned an online alliance with Sony but remained unsure whether to get involved with Microsoft's XBox Live. Electronic Arts said it worried it might risk losing its customers to competing Microsoft games. Sony executives, meanwhile, questioned whether Xbox Live could ever justify itself financially. ''If I were Microsoft, I would spend my money first on selling units rather than building an online service,'' said Kazuo Hirai, the president and chief operating officer of Sony Computer Entertainment America. None of this deters Mr. Allard. Just as 3D graphics propelled growth in the last generation of video games, he said, Microsoft's ability to create a social experience will drive the next generation of gaming. ''The pendulum has swung too far in the single-user direction,'' he said. A critical component of the social experience planned for Xbox Live will be the audio headset, enabling players to cheer and jeer one another. The technology includes a ''voice masking'' feature that will conceal the identities and even ages of the contestants -- a Disneyland safeguard meant to deter adult exploitation of children online. Some analysts agree with Microsoft that voice capabilities could take video gaming to the next level. ''You're looking at a service that will become a new phone network overnight,'' said Richard Doherty, president of Envisioneering, a research and consulting firm in Seaford, N.Y. ''By Christmas, Microsoft could become the nation's fourth-largest phone company.''"

                "LOS ANGELES  Microsoft, seeking to expand offerings on its Xbox 360 console, has reached an agreement with a company headed by Peter Safran, the veteran Hollywood producer and talent manager, to produce original shows for distribution on the system. Through his Safran Company, Mr. Safran represents clients like the actor and producer Sean Combs (“Monster’s Ball”), the actor and writer Nia Vardalos (“My Big Fat Greek Wedding”) and the filmmakers Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer (“Epic Movie”). Mr. Safran founded the company in 2006 after leaving Brillstein-Grey Management. Speaking by telephone last week, Scott Nocas, global marketing manager for programming of the Xbox Live entertainment service, said he expected similar deals to follow. “We definitely look at this as the first of many,” said Mr. Nocas. In an interview at his office in Los Angeles last week, Mr. Safran said his first round of programs would all be scripted, as opposed to reality shows, and would probably run under 10 minutes. He said he planned initially to focus on genres, like comedy and horror, that appeal to the Xbox 360 audience, which is heavily concentrated from the ages of 14 to 34, and tends to be more male than female. The first shows are expected to be available to viewers by the fall. Microsoft’s previous forays in digital entertainment include a two-year-old initiative, MSN Originals, to provide original shows for the Web, and an ill-fated foray more than 10 years ago in which it poured about $100 million into Internet shows like the comedy “475 Madison,” about an advertising agency, then quickly canceled most of them. “The Xbox is unique. It operates at a level outside of what we generally consider Web entertainment,” Mr. Safran said, referring to the system’s tight demographic base, which is defined by the appeal of signature games like the Halo series.  The new shows will be available exclusively via the Xbox 360 for a time, then may appear elsewhere, Mr. Safran said. Mr. Nocas said at least some of the shows would be supported by advertising. Current programming on the Xbox 360 includes movies and selections from cable networks like the Sundance Channel and Spike TV. Viewers pay for access to films with points that can be purchased for cash or accumulated through activities on the system. Mr. Nocas said that about 10 million people had signed up for the Xbox Live service. Roughly 18 million of the game systems have been sold worldwide, he said. The Xbox 360 is up against PlayStation 3 from Sony and the Wii from Nintendo in a hotly competitive gaming marketplace. Mr. Safran is the latest in a growing line of Hollywood players who are seeking to tap into the digital entertainment market, where revenue still falls far short of that from traditional movie and television distribution outlets. Filmmakers like Joel and Ethan Coen and stars like Will Ferrell have recently become involved with Web-based companies like FunnyOrDie.com or 60Frames Entertainment. Mr. Safran and Jake Zim, chief operating officer of the Safran Company’s Safran Digital Group, said they expected to recruit established filmmakers for their new productions, but did not plan to seek involvement by major movie stars."

                "LOS ANGELES — Underscoring the importance Microsoft attaches to its video game efforts, Bill Gates has laid out a vision of a future in which gamers using the Xbox 360 console can be connected to others on a personal computer or a cellphone. The capabilities, part of an initiative called Live Anywhere, will be incorporated into the Windows Vista operating system when it goes on sale next year, he said Tuesday. \"The future is making gaming attractive to people of every age,\" he said. For Gates, Microsoft's chairman, it was the first appearance ever in connection with the Electronic Entertainment Expo, the huge annual video game trade show known as E3, which was to open on Wednesday in Los Angeles. His presence underscored the stakes in Microsoft's push to outflank the other two console makers, Sony and Nintendo. Microsoft has a head start. It introduced Xbox 360 last November, and after some initial supply constraints, 5 million to 5.5 million consoles will have been sold by the end of next month, said Peter Moore, a Microsoft vice president for interactive entertainment. He predicted sales of 10 million units by this fall, when Sony will release the PlayStation 3 and Nintendo the Wii (pronounced \"we\"). By this holiday season, Microsoft said, 160 games will be available for Xbox 360, including \"Grand Theft Auto IV,\" \"Splinter Cell: Double Agent\" and \"Forza Motorsport 2,\" for which Microsoft will sell a wireless steering wheel and headset. In addition, an external module for the Xbox 360 to play high-definition DVDs will be available by the holidays. While the PlayStation 3 will incorporate a drive for movies and games in Blu-ray, Sony's high-definition format, the Microsoft device will be used solely to play movies in a competing format, HD-DVD. With Microsoft's Live Anywhere system, game developers will be able to incorporate features that allow users to send instant messages between devices, and see if their friends are listening to music on their mobile phone or working on a PC. On certain games, players will be able to begin play on the Xbox 360, then switch to a mobile phone; they could also challenge others remotely regardless of whether they were using a PC or an Xbox 360. Sony got the week's events off to a start on Monday by announcing that the PlayStation 3 would be priced higher than expected, with versions selling for $499 and $599 - compared with $299 and $399 for the Xbox 360. At a Nintendo press event on Tuesday, there were no details about the pricing of its own new console beyond a promise from Reggie Fils-Aime, Nintendo of America's executive vice president of sales and marketing, that \"we will give you more fun for less money.\" In addition to new versions of its Zelda and Super Mario games, Nintendo also showed Wii Sports, which includes tennis, golf and Ping-Pong games designed to take advantage of the console's controller, which allows gamers to alter the action by waving it in space much like a club or baseball bat. Sony said Monday that it was incorporating motion sensors into the PlayStation 3 controller as well, but Microsoft said it was not worried by that move."

                "WASHINGTON — In late January, as China locked down some provinces to contain the spread of the coronavirus, average internet speeds in the country slowed as people who were stuck inside went online more and clogged the networks. In Hubei Province, the epicenter of infections, mobile broadband speeds fell by more than half. In mid-February, when the virus hit Italy, Germany and Spain, internet speeds in those countries also began to deteriorate. And last week, as a wave of stay-at-home orders rolled out across the United States, the average time it took to download videos, emails and documents increased as broadband speeds declined 4.9 percent from the previous week, according to Ookla, a broadband speed testing service. Median download speeds dropped 38 percent in San Jose, Calif., and 24 percent in New York, according to Broadband Now, a consumer broadband research site. Quarantines around the world have made people more reliant on the internet to communicate, work, learn and stay entertained. But as the use of YouTube, Netflix, Zoom videoconferencing, Facebook calls and videogaming has surged to new highs, the stress on internet infrastructure is starting to show in Europe and the United States — and the traffic is probably far from its peak. “This is totally unprecedented,” said Thierry Breton, a European Union commissioner who oversees digital policy and was a chief executive of France Télécom. “We have to be proactive.” To head off problems, European regulators like Mr. Breton have pushed streaming companies such as Netflix and YouTube to reduce the size of their video files so they don’t take up as much bandwidth. In the United States, regulators have given wireless carriers access to more spectrum to bolster the capacity of their networks. Some tech companies have responded to the call to ease internet traffic. YouTube, which is owned by Google, said this week that it would reduce the quality of its videos from high to standard definition across the globe. Disney delayed the start of its Disney Plus streaming service in France by two weeks, and Microsoft’s Xbox asked gaming companies to introduce online updates and new releases only at certain times to prevent network congestion. “We really don’t know how long we’re going to be in this mode for,” Dave Temkin, Netflix’s vice president of network and systems infrastructure, said in a webinar on Wednesday on how the coronavirus could affect internet infrastructure. Internet service providers like Comcast, Vodafone, Verizon and Telefónica have been building out their networks for years to account for increasing demand. But company officials said they had never seen such a steep, sudden surge. Growth that the industry had expected to take a year is happening over days, said Enrique Blanco, the chief technology officer at Telefónica, a Spanish telecommunications company. “In just two days we grew all the traffic we had planned for 2020,” Mr. Blanco said. On Monday, traffic on AT&T’s networks was up 27 percent compared to the same day last month, and last week Verizon experienced a 22 percent increase in traffic on its wireless and fiber broadband service. Wi-Fi calls doubled from their normal volume, the carriers said. In Europe, internet traffic into homes over fixed lines was up more than 30 percent, according to Telefónica. Activities like online gaming and video conferencing have more than doubled, while messages over WhatsApp have more than quadrupled. So much traffic and stress on internet networks has slowed the speed of downloading web pages and apps, according to Ookla. “Congestion is higher,” said Adriane Blum, an Ookla spokeswoman. “We’re all at home, and the activities we’re doing in this unprecedented time are not low-bandwidth usage, which means a lot of activity on a network.” Cisco said demand for its WebEx teleconference service had tracked the spread of the coronavirus. Demand first surged in Asia, then in Europe, and last week it soared 240 percent in the United States. The demand has pushed up failure rates delivering video conferencing, said Sri Srinivasan, a Cisco senior vice president in charge of WebEx. “I don’t know if we’ll soon see a peak, not for weeks to come,” he said. “The reason I say that is because we aren’t seeing traffic in Asia slow down even now.” Internet service providers said they could handle the deluge of traffic but were adding capacity. Verizon, Cox and AT&T said they were building more cell sites to strengthen mobile networks, increasing the number of fiber connections on their network backbones, and upgrading the routing and switching technology that lets devices talk to one another and share an internet connection. Orange, formerly France Télécom, has doubled its capacity inside undersea internet cables. In Italy, where home internet use is up 90 percent, Telecom Italia said its technicians continued to make repairs and add capacity. Vodafone, one of Europe’s largest networks operators, said it had increased its capacity 50 percent in recent weeks through a mix of software and the addition of more equipment in the field. “We’re seeing some signs of stress,” AT&T’s chief executive, Randall Stephenson, said in an interview on CNN on Sunday. “We’re having to go out and do some augmentation of networks, and so we’re sending our employees out there to get that done, but right now the network is performing quite well.” To prevent clogged networks, Europe has taken the most aggressive steps. Last week, Mr. Breton, the European Union commissioner, discussed reducing the bitstreams of videos with Reed Hastings, the chief executive of Netflix; Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Google; and Susan Wojcicki, the head of YouTube. The companies agreed, as did Amazon for its Prime Video streaming service and Twitch, its online gaming platform. Many of the companies then went further. On Tuesday, Netflix decided to switch its high-definition video streams in India, Australia and Latin America to slightly lower quality to reduce the traffic they create there by 25 percent, and YouTube said it would make all global streams standard definition. “We continue to work closely with governments and network operators around the globe to do our part to minimize stress on the system during this unprecedented situation,” YouTube said in a statement. Microsoft’s Xbox gaming business recently asked large gaming companies to release online updates of their games during off-peak hours while it helped focus on the critical internet needs of people involved in the coronavirus crisis, according to an Xbox email reviewed by The New York Times. Video game updates can require great amounts of bandwidth to download. Xbox asked the companies to release updates in a four-hour overnight window in North America, and only from Monday through Thursday. “Microsoft is actively monitoring performance and usage trends to ensure we’re optimizing service for our customers worldwide, and accommodating new growth and demand,” the company said. “At the same time, these are unprecedented times, and we’re also taking proactive steps to plan for these high-usage periods.” While U.S. regulators said they did not plan to follow Europe in asking for streaming and social media companies to degrade their services, they are taking other steps. Last week, the Federal Communications Commission granted Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile temporary access to more airwaves. “The F.C.C. has been coordinating closely with network operators to ensure those networks remain up and running,” Ajit Pai, the agency’s chairman, said in a statement. Telefónica’s Mr. Blanco, who has been living under a lockdown in Spain, said he expected the record traffic to last for some time. It may even become the new normal, he said. In Spain, internet use drops only at 8 p.m., when people across the country go to their windows to cheer health workers and others who are helping to manage the crisis. “Suddenly at 8 p.m. it goes down, then it goes back up,” Mr. Blanco said. “It’s a beautiful thing.” Cecilia Kang reported from Washington, Davey Alba from New York and Adam Satariano from London. Karen Weise contributed reporting from Seattle."

                "The last time I was unemployed was in the depths of the Great Recession. I had recently moved in with my girlfriend, who suddenly found herself with an out-of-work partner who rarely left the house. But she gave me some surprising advice: Play video games. I would have a lot of time on my hands, she said, and while I could and should certainly do other things — housework, exercise, searching for a job — I would mostly be stuck at home with limited resources. Without something to occupy my mind, I’d go crazy. She was right. Playing video games helped ease my mind, elevate my mood and possibly saved our relationship. This year we’ll celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary. So now I’m going to give the same advice to anyone who is now out of work, or otherwise kept at home: Play video games. And don’t feel bad about it. If you’re not a gamer, you might think of video games as simple time-wasters. But for those stuck mostly inside without work, killing time is a real problem. And in the world of big-budget console games, 10 to 15 hours is a fairly short experience. Some can take hundreds of hours to complete. There are online games designed to be played and replayed for thousands of hours. But games are more than just empty time-wasters. In periods of pain, boredom or personal emptiness, video games can serve as palliative care for both the body and the mind. Think of gaming as a personal stimulus plan for a nation of unexpected shut-ins: It’s not a long-term solution, it won’t work for everyone, and it won’t solve the underlying problems — but it can provide limited, temporary relief for some. Video games take many forms, but they are all essentially simulations. And when the real world is temporarily unavailable, a simulated version might be what we need. Among other things, video games simulate work: Even the simplest games give players tasks, objectives, lists of things they have to do, problems to solve and a sense of accomplishment upon completion. And the biggest modern games offer seemingly endless lists of quests and objectives, tasks and subtasks, systems to learn and skills to be mastered. A game like the online shooter Destiny 2 offers hundreds, if not thousands, of hours of play, exploration and study. Set in an intricately designed sci-fi world, it tasks players with taking out wave after wave of alien enemies. It also rewards them for understanding a complex character progression system that involves completing ever-more-difficult goals and objectives, sometimes multiple times, in exchange for rarer and more powerful weapons and armor. You might not actually accomplish anything after a day spent checking off quests and gathering virtual materials, but you’ll feel like you did. Game critics have noted the worklike nature of many modern games for years, not always favorably. But in a world of stay-at-home mass unemployment, even the illusion of accomplishment is probably better than none at all. Indeed, the particular shut-in nature of our current crisis makes video games unusually relevant in a different way: What video games do better than any other medium is simulate places. Open-world games like Skyrim, Red Dead Redemption II or The Witcher 3 are built around giant, explorable spaces, sometimes the virtual equivalent of hundreds of square miles, with elaborate geography and shifting weather. They can take days or weeks to fully explore and at their best can be unexpectedly beautiful, offering the opportunity to encounter animated versions of sun-dappled vistas or foggy mountain peaks, to wander through crowded city streets or stroll past others on well-trod footpaths. Games can give us someplace else to go. That makes games useful in another way. Some of us are shut in alone. But especially in cities, many are now effectively trapped inside modest apartments with family or roommates, and little private space. Games offer a form of personal escape, a way to simulate being elsewhere from the confines of your couch. And for those who are alone, games can also serve as social spaces, virtual fields of play for cooperative adventures or competitive contests. Many of today’s most popular games are online experiences that allow players to engage with friends as well as strangers, to forge digital versions of the same sort of bonds with teammates that can develop in the real world. If you’re new at this, the cost of entry is fairly low: There are thousands of high-quality games available for phones, and many more available to download directly to your computer. Even better, many big-budget games are free if you have a computer or game console on which to play them. Late last year, Destiny 2, released in 2017 as a full-priced game, reinvented itself as a free-to-play experience, with the base game available at no cost (players can pay for expansions). Several of the “battle royale” games that have defined the new wave of first-person shooters are also free: A relatively well-reviewed recent entry, Call of Duty: Warzone, offers several clever twists on the popular last-player-standing formula. Not everyone wants to play online shooters, but for those willing to spend a little there are now subscription services that offer access to a large library of games for an annual or monthly fee. For little more than the price of a standard Netflix plan, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate offers access to dozens of games, from moody, philosophical puzzle games like The Talos Principle to richly animated platformers like Ori and the Will of the Wisps. There are sports games, strategy games, role-playing games and simple twitchy diversions that recall the arcade games I pumped quarters into as a kid. And for those who not satisfied with our current quasi-apocalypse, there even games about viral outbreaks and attacks, from the strategic epidemic simulator Plague Inc., to the deftly scripted post-pandemic action game The Last of Us, to The Division 2, a military thriller set in emptied-out recreations of downtown Washington and New York after a viral bioweapon wipes out most of the population. Maybe that one hits a little too close to home. Yes, games are frivolous. Yes, they are escapist. But the longer the coronavirus keeps social life and culture in isolation, the more we’ll need frivolity and escapism. There’s a limit, of course, to what video games can do: They can’t serve as long-term substitutes for real places, real work or real human interaction. But they can give us a simulacrum of all those things at a time when the real ones are in short supply, and tide us over until the world we actually need returns.

                "Like many young hipsters in Austin, Tex., Michael Burns wanted to make it big in some creative field -- perhaps writing comedy scripts in Hollywood. Instead, he wound up in a dead-end job, managing a call center. To kill time, he made friends with a group of equally clever and bored young men at the company where he worked, and they'd sit around talking about their shared passion: video games. Their favorite title was Halo, a best-selling Xbox game in which players control armor-clad soldiers as they wander through gorgeous coastal forests and grim military bunkers and fight an army of lizardlike aliens. Burns and his gang especially loved the \"team versus team\" mode, which is like a digital version of paint ball: instead of fighting aliens, players hook their Xboxes to the Internet, then log on together in a single game, at which point they assemble into two teams -- red-armored soldiers versus blue-armored ones. Instead of shooting aliens, they try to slaughter one another, using grenades, machine guns and death rays. On evenings and weekends, Burns and his friends would cluster around their TV's until the wee hours of the morning, gleefully blowing one another to pieces. \"Halo is like crack,\" Burns recalls thinking. \"I could play it until I die.\" Whenever a friend discovered a particularly cool stunt inside Halo -- for example, obliterating an enemy with a new type of grenade toss -- Burns would record a video of the stunt for posterity. (His friend would perform the move after Burns had run a video cord from his TV to his computer, so he could save it onto his hard drive.) Then he'd post the video on a Web site to show other gamers how the trick was done. To make the videos funnier, sometimes Burns would pull out a microphone and record a comedic voice-over, using video-editing software to make it appear as if the helmeted soldier himself were doing the talking. Then one day he realized that the videos he was making were essentially computer-animated movies, almost like miniature emulations of \"Finding Nemo\" or \"The Incredibles.\" He was using the game to function like a personal Pixar studio. He wondered: Could he use it to create an actual movie or TV series? Burns's group decided to give it a shot. They gathered around the Xbox at Burns's apartment, manipulating their soldiers like tiny virtual actors, bobbing their heads to look as if they were deep in conversation. Burns wrote sharp, sardonic scripts for them to perform. He created a comedy series called \"Red vs. Blue,\" a sort of sci-fi version of \"M*A*S*H.\" In \"Red vs. Blue,\" the soldiers rarely do any fighting; they just stand around insulting one another and musing over the absurdities of war, sounding less like patriotic warriors than like bored, clever video-store clerks. The first 10-minute episode opened with a scene set in Halo's bleakest desert canyon. Two red soldiers stood on their base, peering at two blue soldiers far off in the distance, and traded quips that sounded almost like a slacker disquisition on Iraq: Red Soldier: \"Why are we out here? Far as I can tell, it's just a box canyon in the middle of nowhere, with no way in or out. And the only reason we set up a red base here is because they have a blue base there. And the only reason they have a blue base over there is because we have a red base here.\" When they were done, they posted the episode on their Web site (surreptitiously hosted on computers at work). They figured maybe a few hundred people would see it and get a chuckle or two. Instead, \"Red vs. Blue\" became an instant runaway hit on geek blogs, and within a single day, 20,000 people stampeded to the Web site to download the file. The avalanche of traffic crashed the company server. \"My boss came into the office and was like, 'What the hell is going on?' \" Burns recalls. \"I looked over at the server, and it was going blink, blink, blink.\" Thrilled, Burns and his crew quickly cranked out another video, then another. They kept up a weekly production schedule, and after a few months, \"Red vs. Blue\" had, like some dystopian version of \"Friends,\" become a piece of appointment viewing. Nearly a million people were downloading each episode every Friday, writing mash notes to the creators and asking if they could buy a DVD of the collected episodes. Mainstream media picked up on the phenomenon. The Village Voice described it as \" 'Clerks' meets 'Star Wars,' \" and the BBC called it \"riotously funny\" and said it was \"reminiscent of the anarchic energy of 'South Park.' \" Burns realized something strange was going on. He and his crew had created a hit comedy show -- entirely inside a video game. Video games have not enjoyed good publicity lately. Hillary Clinton has been denouncing the violence in titles like Grand Theft Auto, which was yanked out of many stores last month amid news that players had unlocked sex scenes hidden inside. Yet when they're not bemoaning the virtual bloodshed, cultural pundits grudgingly admit that today's games have become impressively cinematic. It's not merely that the graphics are so good: the camera angles inside the games borrow literally from the visual language of film. When you're playing Halo and look up at the sun, you'll see a little \"lens flare,\" as if you were viewing the whole experience through the eyepiece of a 16-millimeter Arriflex. By using the game to actually make cinema, Burns and his crew flipped a switch that neatly closed a self-referential media loop: movies begat games that begat movies. And Burns and his crew aren't alone. Video-game aficionados have been creating \"machinima\" -- an ungainly term mixing \"machine\" and \"cinema\" and pronounced ma-SHEEN-i-ma -- since the late 90's. \"Red vs. Blue\" is the first to break out of the underground, and now corporations like Volvo are hiring machinima artists to make short promotional films, while MTV, Spike TV and the Independent Film Channel are running comedy shorts and music videos produced inside games. By last spring, Burns and his friends were making so much money from \"Red vs. Blue\" that they left their jobs and founded Rooster Teeth Productions. Now they produce machinima full time. It may be the most unlikely form of indie filmmaking yet -- and one of the most weirdly democratic. \"It's like 'The Blair Witch Project' all over again, except you don't even need a camera,\" says Julie Kanarowski, a product manager with Electronic Arts, the nation's largest video-game publisher. \"You don't even need actors.\" Back in college, Burns and another Rooster Teeth founder, Matt Hullum, wrote and produced a traditional live-action indie movie. It cost $9,000, required a full year to make and was seen by virtually no one. By contrast, the four Xboxes needed to make \"Red vs. Blue\" cost a mere $600. Each 10-minute episode requires a single day to perform and edit and is viewed by hordes of feverish video-game fans the planet over. More than just a cheap way to make an animated movie, machinima allows game players to comment directly on the pop culture they so devotedly consume. Much like \"fan fiction\" (homespun tales featuring popular TV characters) or \"mash-ups\" (music fans blending two songs to create a new hybrid), machinima is a fan-created art form. It's what you get when gamers stop blasting aliens for a second and start messing with the narrative. And God knows, there's plenty to mess with. These days, the worlds inside games are so huge and open-ended that gamers can roam anywhere they wish. Indeed, players often abandon the official goal of the game -- save the princess; vanquish the eldritch forces of evil -- in favor of merely using the virtual environment as a gigantic jungle gym. In one popular piece of Halo machinima, \"Warthog Jump,\" a player cunningly used the game to conduct a series of dazzling physics experiments. He placed grenades in precise locations beneath jeeps and troops, such that when the targets blew sky-high, they pinwheeled through the air in precise formations, like synchronized divers. Another gamer recorded a machinima movie that poked subversive fun at Grand Theft Auto. Instead of playing as a dangerous, cop-killing gangster, the player pretended he was a naïve Canadian tourist -- putting down his gun, dressing in tacky clothes and simply wandering around the game's downtown environment for hours, admiring the scenery. So what's it like to actually shoot a movie inside a game? In June, I visited the Rooster Teeth offices in Buda, Tex., a tiny Austin suburb, to observe Burns and his group as they produced a scene of \"Red vs. Blue.\" Burns, a tall, burly 32-year-old, sat in front of two huge flat-panel screens, preparing the editing software. Nearby were the two Rooster Teeth producers who would be acting on-screen: Geoff Ramsey, a scraggly-bearded 30-year-old whose arms are completely covered in tattoos of fish and skulls, and Gustavo Sorola, a gangly 27-year-old who sprawled in a beanbag chair and peered through his thick architect glasses at the day's e-mail. They were fan letters, Sorola told me, that pour in from teenagers who are as enthusiastic as they are incoherent. \"The way kids write these days,\" he said with a grimace. \"It's like someone threw up on the keyboard.\" In the script they were acting out that day, a pair of \"Red vs. Blue\" soldiers engaged in one of their typically pointless existential arguments, bickering over whether it's possible to kill someone with a toy replica of a real weapon. The Rooster Teeth crew recorded the voice-overs earlier in the day; now they were going to create the animation for the scene. Burns picked up a controller and booted up Halo on an Xbox. He would act as the camera: whatever his character saw would be recorded, from his point of view. Then Sorola and Ramsey logged into the game, teleporting in as an orange-suited and a red-suited soldier. Burns posed them near a massive concrete bunker and frowned as he scrutinized the view on the computer screen. \"Hmmmm,\" he muttered. \"We need something to frame you guys -- some sort of prop.\" He ran his character over to a nearby alien hovercraft, jumped in and parked it next to the actors. \"Sweet!\" he said. \"I like it!\" In a \"Red vs. Blue\" shoot, the actors all must follow one important rule: Be careful not to accidentally kill another actor. \"Sometimes you'll drop your controller and it unintentionally launches a grenade. It takes, like, 20 minutes for the blood splatters to dry up,\" Ramsey said. \"Totally ruins the scene.\" Finally, Burns was ready to go. He shouted, \"Action!\" and the voice-overs began playing over loudspeakers. Sorola and Ramsey acted in time with the dialogue. Acting, in this context, was weirdly minimalist. They mashed the controller joysticks with their thumbs, bobbing the soldiers' heads back and forth roughly in time with important words in each line. \"It's puppetry, basically,\" Ramsey said, as he jiggled his controller. Of all the \"Red vs. Blue\" crew members, Ramsey is renowned for his dexterity with an Xbox. When a scene calls for more than five actors onstage, he'll put another controller on the ground and manipulate it with his right foot, allowing him to perform as two characters simultaneously. As I watched, I was reminded of what initially cracked me up so much about \"Red vs. Blue\": the idea that faceless, anonymous soldiers in a video game have interior lives. It's a \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern\" conceit; \"Red vs. Blue\" is what the game characters talk about when we're not around to play with them. As it turns out, they're a bunch of neurotics straight out of \"Seinfeld.\" One recruit reveals that he chain-smokes inside his airtight armor; a sergeant tells a soldier his battle instructions are to \"scream like a woman.\" And, in a sardonic gloss on the game's endless carnage, none of the soldiers have the vaguest clue why they're fighting. Yet as I discovered, real-life soldiers are among the most ardent fans of \"Red vs. Blue.\" When I walked around the Rooster Teeth office, I found it was festooned with letters, plaques and an enormous American flag, gifts from grateful American troops, many of whom are currently stationed in Iraq. Isn't it a little astonishing, I asked Burns when the crew went out in the baking Texas sun for a break, that actual soldiers are so enamored of a show that portrays troops as inept cowards, leaders as cynical sociopaths and war itself as a supremely meaningless endeavor? Burns laughed, but said the appeal was nothing sinister. \" 'Red vs. Blue' is about downtime,\" he said. \"There's very little action, which is precisely the way things are in real life.\" \"He's right,\" Ramsey added. He himself spent five years in the army after high school. \"We'd just sit around digging ditches and threatening to kill each other all day long,\" he said. \"We were bored out of our minds.\" Perhaps the most unusual thing about machinima is that none of its creators are in jail. After all, they're gleefully plundering intellectual property at a time when the copyright wars have become particularly vicious. Yet video-game companies have been upbeat -- even exuberant -- about the legions of teenagers and artists pillaging their games. This is particularly bewildering in the case of \"Red vs. Blue,\" because Halo is made by Bungie, a subsidiary of Microsoft, a company no stranger to using a courtroom to defend its goods. What the heck is going on? As it turns out, people at Bungie love \"Red vs. Blue.\" \"We thought it was kind of brilliant,\" says Brian Jarrard, the Bungie staff member who manages interactions with fans. \"There are people out there who would never have heard about Halo without 'Red vs. Blue.' It's getting an audience outside the hardcore gaming crowd.\" Sure, Rooster Teeth ripped off Microsoft's intellectual property. But Microsoft got something in return: \"Red vs. Blue\" gave the game a whiff of countercultural coolness, the sort of grass-roots street cred that major corporations desperately crave but can never manufacture. After talking with Rooster Teeth, Microsoft agreed, remarkably, to let them use the game without paying any licensing fees at all. In fact, the company later hired Rooster Teeth to produce \"Red vs. Blue\" videos to play as advertisements in game stores. Microsoft has been so strangely solicitous that when it was developing the sequel to Halo last year, the designers actually inserted a special command -- a joystick button that makes a soldier lower his weapon -- designed solely to make it easier for Rooster Teeth to do dialogue. \"If you're playing the game, there's no reason to lower your weapon at all,\" Burns explained. \"They put that in literally just so we can shoot machinima.\" Other game companies have gone even further. Many now include editing software with their games, specifically to encourage fans to shoot movies. When Valve software released its hit game Half-Life 2 last year, it included \"Faceposer\" software so that machinima creators could tweak the facial expressions of characters. When the Sims 2 -- a sequel to the top-selling game of all time -- came out last year, its publisher, Electronic Arts, set up a Web site so that fans could upload their Sims 2 movies to show to the world. (About 8,000 people so far have done so.) Still, it's one thing for gamers to produce a jokey comedy or a music video. Can machinima actually produce a work of art -- something with serious emotional depth? A few people have tried. In China, a visual artist named Feng Mengbo used the first-person-shooter game Quake III to produce Q4U, in which the screen is filled with multiple versions of himself, killing one another. Players' relationships with constant, blood-splattering violence is a common subject in game art. Last year, the 31-year-old artist Brody Condon produced an unsettling film that consisted of nothing but shots of himself committing suicide inside 50 different video games. \"I try to come to terms with what taking your life means in these games,\" Condon says. \"I'm trying to understand, spiritually, your relationship with an avatar on the screen.\" But even machinima's biggest fans admit that the vast majority of machinima is pretty amateurish. \"It's like if some friends of mine all broke into a movie set, and we all got to use all the cameras and special-effects equipment,\" says Carl Goodman, director of digital media at the American Museum of the Moving Image, which began to hold an annual machinima festival two years ago. \"We wouldn't quite know how to use it, but we'd make some pretty interesting stuff.\" Yet as Goodman points out, there's a competing proposition. Machinima does not always strive to emulate \"realistic,\" artistic movies. On the contrary, it is often explicitly devoted to celebrating the aesthetics of games -- the animations and in-jokes, the precise physics. Most machinima is probably meaningless to people who don't play games, much as ESPN is opaque to anyone who doesn't watch sports. But for those who do play Halo, it was genuinely thrilling to see something like \"Warthog Jump,\" with its meticulously synchronized explosions. The Rooster Teeth crew has its own hilariously stringent rule for making machinima: no cheating. When they shoot \"Red vs. Blue,\" they do not use any special effects that are not organically included in the game; everything you see in an episode of \"Red vs. Blue\" could in theory have taken place during an actual game of Halo, played by a fan in his bedroom. It's a charmingly purist attitude, a sci-fi version of the \"Dogma\" school of indie film, which argues that movies are best when cinematic trickery is kept to a minimum. One evening in New York, I visited with Ethan Vogt as he and his machinima team shot a car-chase scene for a Volvo promo. Vogt and two producers sat at computers, logged into a multiplayer game; each producer controlled a car racing through crowded city streets, while Vogt controlled a free-floating \"camera\" that followed behind, recording the visuals. The vehicles -- an enormous 1972 Chevy Impala and a Volvo V50 -- screamed along at about 60 miles an hour, fishtailing through corners while plowing into mailboxes, lampposts and, occasionally, clots of pedestrians. The lead car burst into flames. \"That's great,\" Vogt said. \"That's great.\" Though it shares with independent filmmaking a do-it-yourself aesthetic, machinima inverts the central tradition of indie film: smallness. With their skimpy budgets, indie directors tend to set movies in kitchens or living rooms -- and focus instead on providing quality acting and scripts. Machinima, in contrast, often has horribly cheesy acting and ham-fisted, purple-prose stories -- but they're set in outer space. Want massive shootouts? Howling mob scenes? Roman gladiatorial armies clashing by night? No problem. It is the rare form of amateur film in which the directors aspire to be not Wes Anderson but George Lucas. Indeed, with video games played on computers, it is now possible to build an entire world from scratch. The core of any video game is its game engine, the software that knows how to render 3-D objects and how to realistically represent the physics of how they move, bounce or collide. But the actual objects inside the game -- the people, the cars, the guns, even the buildings -- can be altered, tweaked or replaced by modifications, or \"mods.\" Mods do not require any deep programming skills; indeed, almost any teenager with a passing acquaintance in graphic-design software can \"re-skin\" a character in a game to make it look like himself, for instance. (Xbox and PlayStation games, in comparison, are much harder to mod, because the consoles are locked boxes, designed to prevent players from tampering with the games.) I was able to see modding in action one night when I visited the ILL Clan, a pioneering machinima group. Their headquarters are the kitchen table in the cramped one-bedroom Brooklyn apartment of Frank Dellario; a lanky, hyperkinetic 42-year-old, he sat on a rickety folding chair, pecking at a keyboard. The table was littered with four computer screens and laptops, the remnants of take-out sushi and a hopelessly tangled morass of computer cords and joysticks; a huge wide-screen TV lurked behind them for viewing their work. On the night I visited, they were using a game engine called Torque to shoot a short heist movie for Audi, in which two thugs beat up a concert violinist and make off with an antique violin in a van. To quickly create a gritty-looking city, Dellario and his colleague -- ILL Clan's co-founder, Matt Dominianni -- hired a local artist to build a generic-looking urban intersection inside the game. To customize it, Dominianni went onto Google, found snapshots of a few seedy stores (an adult bookstore, a tattoo parlor and a furniture outlet) and digitally pasted them onto the front of the buildings. Then they went to a site called Turbo-Squid, a sort of Amazon for virtual in-game items, and for $45 bought a van that could be plunked down inside the game. When I arrived, they were browsing the site and contemplating buying a few women. \"My God, look at this one,\" Dellario marveled, as he clicked open a picture of an eerily realistic 3-D brunette named Masha. \"I'm going to marry this woman. They've finally broken through to total reality.\" Dellario put the van into the correct location in the scene, then logged into the game to figure out the camera angle for this shot. He frowned. It didn't look right. The lighting was all off, with shadows falling in the wrong places. Dominianni figured out the problem: \"The sun is supposed to be at high noon. It's in the wrong place.\" \"Oh, yeah,\" Dellario said. \"Let me move it.\" He pulled up a menu, clicked on the \"sun\" command, and dragged it across the sky. Now they were finally ready to shoot. Dellario realized they needed an extra pair of hands to manipulate one of the thugs. \"Want to act in this scene?\" Dellario asked, and he handed me a joystick. I sat down at one of the computers and took control of \"Thug1,\" a brown-haired man in a golf shirt and brown pants, carrying the stolen violin. Dominianni was playing \"Thug2.\" Our characters were supposed to look around to make sure the coast is clear, then jump in the truck and race off. Dellario gave me my motivation: \"It's like you hear a suspicious noise. You're nervous.\" I used the joystick to practice moving my virtual character, craning its neck -- my neck? -- back and forth. I have played plenty of video games, but this felt awfully odd. Usually when I am inside a game, I'm just worried about staying alive while the bullets whiz past my ears. I've never had to emote. While Dellario and Dominianni fiddled with the camera angle, I grew impatient and wandered around, exploring the virtual set. I peered in a few shop windows -- they were strikingly photorealistic, even up close. Then I walked down an alley and suddenly arrived at the end of the set. It was like a tiny Western town in the desert: once you got beyond the few clustered buildings, there was nothing there -- just a vast, enormous plain, utterly empty and stretching off infinitely into the distance. This spring, electronic arts decided to promote the Sims 2 by hiring Rooster Teeth to create a machinima show using the game. Called \"The Strangerhood,\" it would be freely available online. \"The Strangerhood\" is a parody of reality TV: a group of people wake up one day to discover that they are living in new houses, and they can't remember who they are or how they got there. In the Sims 2, the animated people are impressively Pixar-like and expressive, making \"The Strangerhood\" even more like a mainstream animated show than \"Red vs. Blue\"; you could almost imagine watching it on Saturday morning. The problem is, the Sims 2 has turned out to be incredibly difficult to shoot with. When the Rooster Teeth gang uses Halo for machinima, the characters are mere puppets and can be posed any way the creators want. But in the Sims 2, the little virtual characters have artificial intelligence and free will. When you're playing, you do not control all the action: the fun is in putting your Sims in interesting social situations, then standing back and watching what they'll do. When Rooster Teeth's Matt Hullum builds a virtual set and puts the \"Strangerhood\" characters in place for a shoot, he's never quite sure what will happen. To shoot a scene in which two men wake up in bed together, Hullum had to spend hours playing with the two characters -- who are nominally heterosexual -- forcing them into repeated conversations until they eventually became such good friends they were willing to share a bed. Shooting machinima with Sims is thus maddeningly like using actual, human stars: they're stubborn; they stage hissy fits and stomp off to their trailers. \"We'll do three or four takes of a scene, and one of the Sims will start getting tired and want to go to sleep,\" Hullum said. \"It's just like being on a real set. You're screaming: 'Quick, quick, get the shot! We're losing light!' \" Hullum showed me a typical \"Strangerhood\" scene. He put Nikki, a young ponytailed brunette in a baseball cap, in the kitchen to interact with Wade, a slacker who looked eerily like a digital Owen Wilson. (To give Wade a mellow, San Francisco vibe, Hullum programmed him to move at a pace 50 percent slower than the other characters.) Hullum pointed to Nikki's \"mood\" bar; it was low, which meant she was in a bad mood and wouldn't want to talk. \"When they're bored, you have to lock them in a room alone for a few hours until they start to crave conversation,\" Hullum said. He tried anyway, prodding Wade to approach her and talk about food, one of Nikki's favorite subjects. It worked. The two became engrossed in a conversation, laughing and gesticulating wildly. \"See, this footage would be great if we were shooting a scene where these guys are maybe gossiping,\" Hullum mused, as he zoomed the camera in to frame a close-up on Wade. Then Nikki started to yawn. \"Oh, damn. See -- she's getting bored. Oh, no, she's walking away,\" Hullum said, as the little virtual Nikki wandered out of the room. \"Damn. You see what we have to deal with?\" The audience for \"The Strangerhood\" has not exploded the way \"Red vs. Blue\" did. The project is a gamble: its creators hope it will break out of machinima's geeky subculture and vault into the mainstream. Though in a way, Hullum said, the mainstream isn't always a fun place to be, either. Before he returned to Austin to work on \"Red vs. Blue,\" he spent six miserable years in Hollywood working on second-rate teen movies with big budgets, like \"Scooby-Doo\" and \"The Faculty.\" \"So now to come to this, where we have total creative control of our own stuff, it's amazing,\" Hullum said, as he watched Nikki walk out of the house in search of a more interesting conversation. \"I just pray we can keep this going. Because if we can't, I'm in big trouble.\" Clive Thompson is a contributing writer for the magazine."

                "SYNTHETIC WORLDS The Business and Culture of Online Games. By Edward Castronova. 332 pp. University of Chicago Press. $29. SMARTBOMB The Quest for Art, Entertainment and Big Bucks in the Videogame Revolution. By Heather Chaplin and Aaron Ruby. 287 pp. Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill. $24.95. Here's a theory that may be neither original nor empirically defensible but feels true: The more fun an activity is, the less interesting it is to read about. War producces great journalism; water-skiing does not. Can you guess where video games fall on this spectrum? In the last few years, a great many words have been expended to report on this flourishing cultural phenomenon. Most accounts begin with a hyperactive presentation of statistics, which we will not rehearse here. This is all you need to know (and perhaps already do): Video games have grown into a huge business, outpacing the movie industry and bulldozing childhood as we knew it. We adults are not safe, either. Whether they admit it or not, you probably have friends who can be found awake at 2 a.m. disemboweling orcs, foiling terrorist plots and scooping up fumbles and running them into end zones. It is the opinion of Edward Castronova, author of \"Synthetic Worlds,\" that such electronic experiences are not merely a hedge against boredom but a profound indicator of where the entire world is heading. Online, off-line; reality, fantasy -- these distinctions will cease to matter as more and more of us pass our time in virtual environments. Economies will evolve as we pay real money for virtual goods and vice versa. Conflicts that begin online will spill into the real world and back. Laws will be written to protect our newfound interests. Castronova's vision has elements of both utopia and dystopia. But mostly he is bullish. Life in these alternative zones may eventually become so fulfilling, he contends, \"that a fairly substantial exodus may loom in the distance.\" He means this, really. Like the Irish and Italians who left their native lands in the late 19th century to come to America, gamers could create a genuine human migration, away from the real and into the virtual. What will be real then? The specific object of Castronova's scholarship is Mmorpgs, the inelegant acronym for \"massively multiplayer online role-playing games,\" which can involve hundreds of thousands of players plugging in from all over the world. A disproportionate number of these games revolve around dwarfs, wizards, quests and magic lands, though the content is becoming ever more diverse. These days, there's a Mmorpg out there to suit the interests of just about anybody. One game, The Sims Online, merely simulates suburban life, and it is madly popular. Castronova is an economist who teaches telecommunications at Indiana University, and among academic economists he is a bold contrarian, if only because he dares to take computer games seriously. My oh my does he take them seriously. In dense, lifeless prose, he sledgehammers away at his major themes, constantly pausing to review the material he's just covered and preview what is to come. His sweeping conclusions are intriguing -- get ready for governments sending agents into virtual worlds and waging war with avatars! -- but he's not a vivid enough writer to animate most of his futuristic abstractions. In \"Smartbomb,\" Heather Chaplin and Aaron Ruby try harder to entertain. They've organized their history of video games as a study of ambitious individuals, breaking it down into a series of breezy, magazinelike profiles of uneven quality. A lot of the original reporting seems to take place at gaming conventions, which is not where one imagines the really interesting stuff happens. But the stories are pretty good, even when they don't break new ground. Rereading the legend of Nolan Bushnell and the founding of Atari is like hearing a bar band play a spirited \"Twist and Shout\" -- enjoyable, but no additional points for Degree of Difficulty. In two spots, though, Chaplin and Ruby really score. In their chapter on Mmorpgs, they sensitively profile David Reber, a 30-year-old Californian who spends every free moment chained to his computer, acting out a series of intense fantasy existences that provide him with the companionship and sense of achievement missing in his real life. Just as Castronova would predict, Reber withdraws from the real world as his fantasy life deepens -- he has lapses at work and when Chaplin and Ruby last check in with him, he's moved back in with his mother. The other winning portrait in \"Smartbomb\" is of Will Wright, the creator of SimCity, as well as its offshoot The Sims, and a new simulation called Spore in which players guide a new creature from its biological origin onward. In an industry that mimics Hollywood's craven predilection for cheap, gory theatrics, Wright stands apart as a humble philosopher in love with the potential of games to expand the human experience. Though Chaplin and Ruby don't have much to say themselves about the significance of video games, they wisely hand matters over to Wright, who foresees a future that might just keep us all staying up past 2 a.m. \"I think one thing that's unique about video games is not only that they can respond to you but down the road they'll be able to adapt themselves to you. They'll learn your desires,\" he says. \"It might just be that games become deeply personal artifacts -- more like dreams.\" Video Game Books Hugo Lindgren is the editorial director of New York Magazine."

                "THE great thing about shopping for video games is that the person you're buying the gift for almost certainly knows more about it than you do. If you have gamers in your life, no matter what age, odds are that they already know exactly what they want. You need only shut up and fork over the credit card. You can use this to your advantage. If you are lucky enough that the gamer on your list has said anything recently about a game or game machine that is not Microsoft's new Xbox 360, the smart move is to drop whatever you're doing right now and buy it. That way, you will not be among the hordes this holiday season already wondering if they can afford to miss a car payment, or maybe a mortgage installment, to satisfy their 360-craving gamer. That is because the 360, with its snazzy graphics and slick online interface, has emerged as the It gift of the 2005 holiday season. Theoretically, the 360 is supposed to cost $300 for a basic unit and $400 for the deluxe version. In reality, the console is sold out across the country and is now fetching $1,000 or so on eBay. And that's before you buy any games, which run up to $60 each. So if your favorite gamer is interested in anything else this year, consider yourself fortunate. Thankfully, forgoing the 360 doesn't mean returning to the Stone Age of, say, Pong. There are still excellent games being made for the current generation of home game consoles -- Sony's PlayStation 2, Nintendo's GameCube, and the original Xbox, which each cost less than $200 -- and Sony's $250 PSP headlines the strong current crop of hand-held units. Moreover, if you have a powerful PC, that may still be your most capable game machine. In any case, both Sony and Nintendo have new game consoles on the way next year. And availability of the 360 is sure to improve in early 2006. There is a chance that Microsoft could show up with a \"surprise\" boatload of additional 360's in the next few weeks. (The word from the company is that it is working as hard as it can to get units to retailers.) Unless you're willing to pay the prices on eBay or other auction sites, the best advice to shoppers who absolutely must have a 360 is to get themselves on waiting lists at as many retailers and Web sites as possible. So those folks you saw camped out on sidewalks before the 360 went on sale on Nov. 22 don't look so silly now, right? Waiting in line for a midnight sale at a Wal-Mart in Moline, Ill., Kara Harvell told The Quad-City Times that she wanted to buy the console for her five sons. Deliciously, the newspaper reported that Ms. Harvell, a nursing school student, \"got out of class by telling her professor that her son wasn't feeling well at school.\" Of course, some people don't like waiting in line. In the (very) few days before the machine sold out, scattered reports emerged of shoppers being held up for their 360's as they left stores. Please don't go robbing anyone. But if you've already gone through the effort of finding a 360 at its regular price, it is certainly worth the extra $100 for the higher-end model. The full version comes with a headset (for making free phone calls over the Internet to other Xbox users), a wireless controller (instead of a wired model) and a hard drive, which you need to play games made for the original Xbox. Top-line games are $50 to $60. The unit comes with a free basic membership to Microsoft's online game service, which lets you talk to other online 360 users and compare scores. But if you want to actually play head-to-head live over the Internet, you need to buy the \"gold\" membership, which costs $8 a month or $50 a year. In addition to playing games with eye-popping graphics, the machine plays DVD's and can display photos from your digital camera on your regular or high-definition television. Luckily, the 360 is not the only game system potentially worth buying this holiday season. There are cheaper and more readily available options, too. Besides the Xbox 360, the other major new game machine is Sony's PSP hand-held. The sleek black unit has a clear, colorful screen that is far more vibrant than one would expect from a hand-held device, and that may be why people on buses and trains seem to be using their PSP's to watch movies as much as playing games. Dozens of movies are now being released on the small UMD data discs that slip into the back of the PSP, which inexplicably comes with white headphones reminiscent of those supplied with Apple's iPods. Over all, the games for the PSP have been lackluster so far, but that trend shows signs of changing. Aimed at adults, the new Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories takes advantage of the PSP's built-in wireless capability to allow multiple PSP users to battle one another through the game's streets and alleys, even as the players themselves are on the go. Next year, a new installment of the quirky family-friendly Japanese game Katamari Damacy is expected for the PSP. Even cheaper and smaller than the PSP is Nintendo's DS hand-held, which costs about $130. Nintendo has long been popular with young gamers, but the new Nintendogs pet simulator is finding fans among both children and adult women. The screens on the DS, which stands for dual screen, are not quite as impressive as the PSP's, but are still clear enough for enjoyable gaming. But rather than play on the go, many people still prefer their video games on the television in the den. With all of the hype around the 360 it is easy to overlook that you can now buy the original Xbox or Sony's PlayStation 2 each for around $150. Bundles that include a console and a few games can be found under $300 on the Web. Nintendo's GameCube console now costs only around $100. Of course, the Xbox, GameCube and PS2 certainly don't have the cachet of the new 360. And most serious gamers already have one, two or even all three of the older systems. But if you are looking for a cost-effective way to introduce a young person to gaming, buying any of the older systems is a smart move. In fact, many serious gamers would argue that the games being made now for those mature machines are actually better than those for the 360, which is still so new that developers have not yet figured out how to fully harness its power. The older games just don't look quite as snazzy. But until Sony's PlayStation 3 and Nintendo's Revolution are released next year, the Xbox 360 is clearly the best gaming machine around (unless you want to consider a top-notch gaming PC, which could easily cost more than $2,000). If someone you know wants a 360 and you can't find it at a reasonable price, perhaps fend them off with a PSP or a gift certificate that can be exchanged for some new games for an existing console. Then promise you'll get a 360, PlayStation 3 or Revolution next year. You may forget the promise, but they won't. Is It Live, or Is It A Video Game? THERE are about 20 games available for Microsoft's new Xbox 360. It does not have a single hit title yet, as Halo became for the original Xbox, and the lineup is still missing some genres, like role-playing games. Nonetheless, games out now do a good job of demonstrating how the next generation of consoles deliver visual and social experiences far more sophisticated than those possible on older consoles. The strongest two genres on the 360 are auto racing and first-person shooters. On the racetrack, Project Gotham Racing 3 lets you speed through detailed recreated cities like New York, Las Vegas and London. You can race in online leagues, compete against \"ghosts\" that simulate your friends' best performances or \"tune in\" and watch from the sidelines as some of the best virtual drivers in the world go wheel to wheel. The shooters put a player in the perspective of a person fighting, often with guns. Among the standouts are Perfect Dark Zero, set in the near future, and Call of Duty 2, a gritty re-creation of World War II. The most visually impressive 360 game is Kameo: Elements of Power, an action adventure that looks like child's play, with its evocation of a Pixar animated film, but is challenging at points. About half the games for the 360 mimic real-life sports. NBA 2K6, which at times could pass for a live telecast, is the most impressive of the bunch. Amped 3, a snowboarding simulator, is easy to play and gorgeous to watch. SETH SCHIESEL"

                "Tomorrow the Xbox, the new video-game console from Microsoft, arrives in stores on the heels of a $500 million marketing blitz. But it doesn't seem as if much of that money is going to the thousands of musicians who have provided the company with songs to use in the games that will be played on it. Though a band can typically make $10,000 to $20,000 when a song is included in a video game, Microsoft has been asking musicians to contribute their music to video games for pennies -- and in some cases no money at all, with no upfront fee and no royalties on the back end. Musicians, from small, independent punk bands to major-label artists, have been accepting this deal, hoping for the promotional boost that comes with being heard in a game that is played obsessively by teenagers across the country. Joining a band is not a lucrative career choice for most musicians. Many who are signed to major labels spend their careers in debt to those record companies, trying to earn back advances and expenses. But the increasing use of contemporary songs in movies, video games and advertisements has meant an unexpected windfall for lesser-known and midlevel artists. Microsoft, however, is changing that dynamic. ''I asked if we could get any money, and they just said no,'' said Larry Cooper, who runs Revelation Records, a punk, metal and hardcore label that has several songs on the soundtrack to Amped, a snowboarding game. ''I almost thought that out of principle, if there's no payment, we shouldn't do that kind of stuff. But I didn't want to snip out an opportunity for a band that might want to do that kind of promotion.'' Of the bands Mr. Cooper asked, all but one agreed to provide free music to Microsoft. ''I think they were just looking for cheap music, and that's why they called a lot of small labels,'' Mr. Cooper continued. ''I asked them who else was on the soundtrack and made some suggestions, but they said they wanted to stick with certain labels because they didn't have to pay for licensing.'' Brenner Adams, a product planner on Amped, said that on his game Microsoft was looking not for cheap music but for an opportunity to expose as many small underground bands as possible. Under Microsoft policy the interview with Mr. Adams was conducted with a company publicist on the line, taking notes on the conversation. ''We're not saying, 'Hey, we want to use your music for nothing,' '' Mr. Adams said. ''We said, 'Hey, we really want to promote these artists and promote who they are and what they stand for.' '' Though Microsoft didn't give any money to musicians on such independent labels, it did offer small amounts to bands on major labels. It made a deal with Virgin Records, obtaining songs from acts like the Gorillaz, Iggy Pop, the Chemical Brothers and Timbaland & Magoo by paying ''small fees and publishing,'' said Brad Fox, the director of artist development at Virgin. The amount of course remains a big contrast to the millions of dollars that Microsoft is believed to have paid to use Madonna's ''Ray of Light'' in its 60-second Windows XP advertisement. ''We're looking at this as a marketing exercise,'' Mr. Fox said. ''There's no way I could get 10 to 15 different artists in somebody's house in front of an active consumer audience for 20 hours a week. If I could get 20 percent of those kids to go buy a record, that's great.'' But the Xbox isn't like other systems, nor are these deals like other deals. Many record labels are operating on the faith that Microsoft will make efforts to promote their bands. Mr. Fox said he hoped that the Virgin artists used in the games would be mentioned in Xbox promotional material, game catalogs and game boxes. But a trip to the Xbox Web site showed that the artists on games like Amped were not mentioned on the box or promotional poster shown online, nor were the bands on any game highlighted in any special way on the Web site. Other promotional efforts, however, have been made: there was a link at the site to a radio station playing music from Amped, and at a recent Xbox promotional party in Los Angeles Microsoft gave away a CD with music from Amped. Mr. Adams noted that most of the cash deals were made with better-known bands that don't need the publicity as much. ''So,'' he said, ''why not turn the decision around, bring the smaller guys up and give them the promotion they can't get anywhere else?'' He said that music from some 240 artists was used on Amped, that in the game the names of the record labels are shown on banners and that players had the option of seeing names of the bands, songs and record labels. He added that the company hoped to stage more promotions with the music. But there is no guarantee that gamers will hear much if any of the music of these bands. That is because in a feature unique to the Xbox consumers have the option of wiping out the soundtrack to a game and replacing it with music from their own CD's. Originally music executives were less worried about artists not getting paid than about the potential for Xbox to become a new Napster, since it has a large hard drive and online capabilities. But in a statement prepared for this article Microsoft said that though music could be stored on the hard drive, it could not be copied on ''CD's, MP3's or any other devices.'' Other executives in the music publishing business now worry that video game manufacturers and even advertising agencies will follow Microsoft's lead and tell bands that in exchange for use of their music at no cost, an extra effort will be made to promote the groups in products and commercials. As it is, artists sacrifice a lot of money and time at the altar of promotion, taking on costly and inconvenient tasks gratis, like performing concerts promoted by radio stations. So, some wonder, in a field in which just about anything musicians do can be seen as raising their profiles, where is the line between promotional and paid work? Jeff Koz, the chief executive of SubZero, a company that brokers deals between advertisers and musicians, said, ''We believe that people should be paid for what they do.'' Mr. Koz has worked with Microsoft on music and sound design. He added, however, that there was a give-and-take between payment and promotion, and lesser-known artists were often given somewhat lower fees in exchange for what could be career-enhancing exposure. ''There's value to cross-promotion,'' he said, ''and we're not privy to how those Microsoft deals went down. Some of those bands might see it as a tremendous opportunity.'' No. 1 and Dropping The new Britney Spears album, ''Britney,'' will enter the pop charts next week at No. 1 with 769,000 copies sold, according to Soundscan, a company that tracks retail sales. The number, a significant drop from the first-week sales of her previous album (1.3 million), reflects a teenage pop demand that is slipping but still hanging on tenaciously as Ms. Spears sagely remakes her image so she has one foot in the teenage world and the other in the general pop market (an approach best summed up by her song title ''I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman''). The following week, record executives say, ''Britney'' seems likely to slip to No. 2 when the Garth Brooks album ''Scarecrow'' makes its debut with predicted sales of more than one million copies."

                "LOS ANGELES — Microsoft, seeking to expand offerings on its Xbox 360 console, has reached an agreement with a company headed by Peter Safran, the veteran Hollywood producer and talent manager, to produce original shows for distribution on the system. Through his Safran Co., he represents clients like the actor and producer Sean Combs (\"Monster's Ball\"), the actor and writer Nia Vardalos (\"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\") and the filmmakers Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer (\"Epic Movie\"). Safran founded the company in 2006 after leaving Brillstein-Grey Management. Speaking by telephone last week, Scott Nocas, global marketing manager for programming of the Xbox Live entertainment service, said he expected similar deals to follow. \"We definitely look at this as the first of many,\" said Nocas. In an interview at his office in Los Angeles last week, Safran said his first round of programs would be scripted and would probably run under 10 minutes. He said his initial focus would be on genres like comedy and horror that appeal to the Xbox 360 audience, which is heavily concentrated from the ages of 14 to 34, and tends to be more male than female. The first shows are expected to be available to viewers by autumn in the Northern Hemisphere. \"The Xbox is unique; it operates at a level outside of what we generally consider Web entertainment,\" Safran said, referring to the system's tight demographic base, which is defined by the appeal of signature games like the Halo series. The new shows will be available exclusively via the Xbox 360 for a time, then may appear elsewhere, Safran said."

                "Looking for an advantage in the next round of the video-console wars, Microsoft has made the first move. Three and a half years after it entered the console market with the Xbox, Microsoft yesterday unveiled its successor, the Xbox 360, a creamy white console that is to go on sale in North America, Europe and Japan by the holiday season. Though noticeably smaller than its squat black predecessor, the console houses three 3.2-gigahertz I.B.M. microprocessors that could qualify it as the most powerful home computer on the market. Indeed, unlike the original Xbox, the new console can act as a home entertainment hub, streaming pictures, music and video from digital cameras, portable music players and computers that run Microsoft Windows XP. Most evidently different, Xbox 360, which Microsoft introduced last night in a 30-minute presentation on MTV, is designed to display games in wide-screen, high-definition format as well as in standard definition. Microsoft's move, after years of secrecy, rumors and fragmentary disclosures, comes as its competitors -- Sony, the undisputed industry leader, and Nintendo, a close third worldwide -- are also preparing presentations of their coming consoles for the Electronic Entertainment Expo, a major industry trade show, in Los Angeles next week. Representatives of those companies said their game systems, Sony's PlayStation 3 and Nintendo's, which is code-named Revolution, are set for release next year. For the game industry, with $10 billion a year in sales in the United States alone, the consoles' arrivals will not only give rise to new demand for game hardware but will set off a new wave of game development and purchases. As the consoles put new emphasis on high-definition video, they may stimulate TV sales as well. One analyst, describing the anticipation surrounding the announcements, said it was as if Detroit released a new line of automobiles only once every four or five years. \"The business is getting bigger, the stakes are getting higher, and there is such a big leap in technology, potentially making the games ever more realistic and involving,\" said Anita Frazier, entertainment industry analyst for NPD Funworld. Microsoft did not disclose the pricing of its new console. Since their introductions, the current Xbox and Sony's PlayStation 2 have dropped in price from $300 to $150 in the United States; Nintendo's GameCube, originally $200, is now $100. When Xbox arrived in 2001, it was heralded as the most powerful of the consoles and had innovations including a built-in hard drive and an Ethernet port for online play. The machine's biggest hits have been the Halo games, published by Microsoft itself; Halo 2, released last fall, has sold 6.3 million copies. Xbox has also developed a following among game developers, who have been drawn to its power. Still, even with 20 million consoles sold, Xbox has been far outdistanced by Sony's PlayStation 2, with sales of 80 million and 70 percent of the world market. While Halo 2's success put Microsoft's games unit in the black for one quarter last year, the Xbox effort has yet to provide sustained profitability. \"Xbox 1 was very much ready, fire, aim,\" said J Allard, corporate vice president at Microsoft and a leading architect of the Xbox effort. \"We had 19 months and a day between the day we approved the project to the day we were on store shelves.\" For the new Xbox project, Mr. Allard said his team had twice that time and aimed at conceiving a \"magical product\" that was so well integrated it would seem the creation of a single mind. In sheer computing power, the new Xbox is capable of a trillion calculations per second, many orders of magnitude above the original Xbox. (The current box depends mainly on a 733-megahertz processor.) The heat generated by all that power will be drawn off by a water-based cooling system, something usually seen only in high-end PC's. It will also include a redesigned wireless game controller. A Web camera, code-named Cyclops, and a TV-like remote control will be optional. Peter Moore, a Microsoft corporate vice president for worldwide sales and marketing, said Xbox 360 would be especially suited for wide-screen high-definition television and Digital Dolby 5.1 multichannel sound, a requirement for all Xbox 360 games. He added that the new console would also be more seamlessly integrated with Xbox Live, the service that connects games and gamers over high-speed Internet connections for multiplayer action. Xbox Live, which has 1.4 million subscribers, will include a new tier that waives the $6 monthly fee. A demonstration of the console's power delivered stunningly realistic scenes that were indistinguishable at some points from live-action video. \"We have to continue to feed that core audience,\" Robert J. Bach, senior vice president and chief Xbox officer at Microsoft, said of the most ardent gamers. \"But part of the challenge of this next generation is how do we cultivate a broader mass audience.\" Part of that strategy, he said, includes designing Xbox 360 to perform a range of nongaming functions suited to the living room, like streaming digital music and pictures, or videoconferencing. In addition to playing DVD's, as the current Xbox does, it can rip songs from CD's onto a 20-gigabyte hard drive -- a hard drive that can be removed, upgraded and interchanged with other 360 consoles. Judging by dozens of Web sites dedicated to interest in next-generation consoles, expectations are soaring that Xbox 360's competitors will also provide vastly improved graphics, sound and game playing. For example, it is widely believed that Sony's PlayStation 3, which will use a new cell processor technology, will be the most powerful. Molly Smith, a Sony spokeswoman, would not discuss hardware specifics of the PlayStation 3. But she did say that it would be able to deliver \"a quantum leap\" in gaming and electronic entertainment. Nintendo, struggling to shed an image that its technologies mostly appeal to children, is preparing to deliver a game console that is radically different from the cute and cuddly GameCube. Perrin Kaplan, Nintendo's vice president for corporate affairs, said GameCube's successor would be \"very, very sleek.\" She described it as horizontal and no taller than a stack of three DVD cases. Unlike GameCube, the new system will play DVD's, Ms. Kaplin said, and will feature a wireless controller. It will play GameCube games as well as a new class of high-definition games, with new emphasis on online play. Microsoft would not say whether games for the current Xbox would play on Xbox 360. Some industry analysts and game developers said it was likely that games for all three consoles would increase to $60 or $65; the typical price for premium titles on the current machines is $50. \"Over all, the introduction of the next-generation systems will have a very positive impact on the video game industry,\" said Will Kassoy, vice president for global brand management at Activision, a game publisher. \"They will expand the user base and grow software sales.\" Historically, he said, each new cycle of consoles has ushered in a 30 percent rise in the number of players. \"We believe this next generation will see similar growth,\" Mr. Kassoy said. Activision is scheduled to have four games for Xbox 360 at the start, including some of the company's best-selling series -- Tony Hawk, Call to Duty and Quake. Simon Jeffery, president of Sega, said his company would have two titles for Xbox 360 for the holiday season -- Condemned: Criminal Origins and Full Auto -- emphasizing that they will take advantage of the new console's increased power. \"Every successive jump in technology affords new elements of games,\" he said. \"We now will have processing power to do things we haven't been able to do before.\""

                "Sending voice and Webcam picture messages to fellow Xbox 360 players over Microsoft’s Xbox Live service is a cinch, but tapping out old-fashioned text messages using the 360’s onscreen keyboard isn’t much fun. A new $30 miniature keyboard called the Chatpad speeds up text entry to let you best even the fastest BlackBerry touch-typists.  The Chatpad, to go on sale Sept. 6, attaches to the underside of the 360’s controller without interfering with the controller’s comfortable feel in the hands. A backlight makes typing during late-night Gears of War campaigns easier on the eyes, and a dedicated Messenger button activates the 360’s instant messaging program so you can taunt your enemies without breaking from the action. Unfortunately you can’t use the keyboard to type a letter and jump to the corresponding spot in long lists of Xbox Live movie downloads or songs stored on an iPod connected to the 360. Instead, you need to hold down the scroll button. Albert Penello, director for global marketing for Xbox, said the company was looking into a way to add this feature. "

                "FORGET horsepower, forget miles per gallon: the key metric for judging the Nissan Urge, a design study to be introduced today at the North American International Automobile Show in Detroit, is polygons per second, an index of performance for video games. Five hundred million polygons a second is the rating for the Microsoft Xbox 360 video game system tucked away in the car's trunk. It pumps out images fast enough to generate dizzyingly sharp scenes of city streets and speeding cars on a display that folds down from above the windshield. The Urge's key trick is that when parked, its steering wheel and pedals can be used to control the Xbox. The game's soundtrack of roaring engines and screeching tires play through the car's speakers to accompany the action on the screen. Many cars have had video game displays installed in their dashboards. The Urge is the first car to be turned into a game controller -- the tail is now wagging the dog. The Urge, created at Nissan Design America in the La Jolla section of San Diego, is another of the auto industry's seemingly endless quests for \"echo boomer\" customers, a coterie that for carmakers gleams over the horizon the way the mythical city of Eldorado did for the conquistadors. In part, the Urge is a response to an online survey, said John Cupit, a design manager for Nissan. Mr. Cupit interpreted the survey results in the bare, exposed look of the Urge, an articulation of the car's parts aimed, he said, at giving the feel of a motorcycle. The fenders and structure, mostly aluminum, stand out as separate parts. The engine -- a piece of the car so unimportant in this case that Nissan did not even provide the usual specifications of horsepower and torque -- is visible beneath a transparent hood. Nissan calls the look \"minimalism to the maximum.\" The bottoms of the doors are cut away, revealing a surrounding frame of aluminum rendered in \"acid yellow,\" which Anka Mazzei, the color designer, said she chose to express intensity and speed. The front end of the Urge is similar to the GT-R Proto, a concept that Nissan unveiled at the Tokyo auto show last fall. But one should not take the exterior of the Urge too literally. Its weirdness signals that it is unlikely to become a production vehicle. What counts is the concept. Urge is an implicit response to cultural change: young buyers have proved more fascinated by the innovations of their new cellphones, hand-held devices and video games than by the automotive advances that captivated their parents. The showcase game for the Xbox 360 is a special edition of Project Gotham Racing, one of the hit titles for the original Xbox as well. Mr. Cupit said that he and his colleagues at the La Jolla studio spend a lot of time playing on a huge plasma screen. The project was a joint effort with Microsoft, so the Xbox 360 beneath the boattail- shape trunk, one of a half-million consoles shipped since the game system went on sale Nov. 22, is different from the others: no one stood in line to buy it. Video gaming is not the only technology incorporated into the Urge. In addition to the Xbox 360, there is an iPod docking station and a cellphone that doubles as a \"smart key\" to start the engine. In at least one respect, the Urge might be the perfect car: it burns no gasoline while parked for game playing; it generates no emissions; it lines up in no traffic jams. It can virtually roll through the streets of Las Vegas or spin around the Nürburgring. Its version of Gotham Racing can even run uptown on the parts of Broadway that are one-way heading downtown, a special thrill for Manhattan drivers. With a wireless connection, in theory, two Urges could be parked side-by-side for competition like the old racing games at the arcade in Atlantic City. Thanks to the Internet, the same thing could be done even if the Urges were half a world apart. The game encourages stylish driving. Good driving through the curves earns the driver style points, called Kudos, that can be redeemed for a better vehicle. According to the Microsoft programmers, power sliding, pulling off a 360-degree spin, getting air time, drafting and getting up on two wheels \"will earn gamers Kudos points for their style and skill.\" Too bad the real automotive world doesn't work this way. Each car in the game is made up of 80,000 polygons and takes eight days of programming by its creators, who are holed up in the London studio of Bizarre Creations. Real-world details include gauges that move and realistic bug-smash streaks on the windshield. Oddly, the Urge itself is not among the cars you can drive on the screen. That will probably be remedied soon. Project Gotham players and programmers regularly produce new cars that can be downloaded. The Urge's notion of car-as-video game is not unprecedented. A similar concept, the Scion Speedster -- a red Scion xA show car built by 5 Axis Productions in Huntington Beach, Calif. -- was displayed at the Specialty Equipment Market Association trade show in Las Vegas last fall. The Speedster also has an open panel in the doors -- and two Xboxes running the Forza racing game onboard. The two cars simply evolved at the same time, Mr. Cupit said. He prefers his version of the idea. \"We tried to take seriously designing the door glass to protect the occupants from wind and rain, and also vehicle ingress-egress,\" he said. \"Our door moves up and down to ease entry into the car, for example.\" \"We often visit tuner and customizing shows to see what young people are thinking about,\" Mr. Cupit said. \"The Urge helps reinvent the sports car for the next generation of young people.\" Observing young people at auto shows, it is impossible not to note that they pay more attention to how their cars look and sound than how fast they go. The investment tends to go into electronics and colorful bolt-on parts, rather than into making the engine run faster and more furious. Maybe more automakers should put Xboxes in their cars. General Motors and Ford might stir up interest by tucking Xbox 360's into all their trunks."

                "REDMOND, Wash. — Microsoft is betting it has a new way to win the wallets of consumers. The company on Tuesday introduced the new version of its Xbox video game console. The Xbox has been one of Microsoft’s few undeniable consumer hits of the last decade, a product that was not just a credible entry into the games business but also a sign of the innovation possible at a company that is rarely seen as an inventive thinker. “I think of Xbox as the accidental success out of Microsoft,” said James McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester Research, who added that the connection Microsoft has formed with the players of its current Xbox is “much deeper than any relationship Microsoft has ever achieved before.”  The new console, the Xbox One, will enter a market very different from the one its predecessor, the Xbox 360, entered nearly eight years ago, when there was no iPad, smartphones had keyboards and mobile gaming devices were primitive at best.  Today, video games can be played almost anywhere, on any device, with the biggest possible audience of online friends and without the aid of a costly gaming console. The last year or two has been bumpy for Microsoft’s consumer efforts. The Windows 8 operating system software and the Surface tablet-computing devices got a tepid reception from the public when they went on sale last fall.  The company’s mobile phone efforts have been largely ignored. And even Bing, Microsoft’s Internet search engine, has failed to close a wide gap with Google, the market leader.  Microsoft, though, could see better results with the Xbox. With it, it hopes it can reassert the living room as the place where people can still get the best gaming experience, complete with eye-popping graphics and innovative methods for controlling games. It is also a place where Microsoft’s technology can be at the center of a home entertainment system and the funnel through which people gain access to online video. Microsoft has sold more than 76 million of the device’s current incarnation, the Xbox 360 worldwide, compared with almost 100 million Wii consoles from Nintendo and more than 70 million PlayStation 3s from Sony.  The company also controls what may be the most valuable asset in console gaming, Xbox Live, a subscription-based online service with 48 million members who use it to play games against one another and watch movies.  “You can do a lot of things on the phone and a lot of things on tablets,” said John Taylor, an analyst at Arcadia Investment. But, he said, “you can’t do the same kinds of things on those devices” that you can on a television screen. Microsoft plans to develop its own original, live-action television series, which will be accessible through the Xbox. The series will be made in partnership with the director Steven Spielberg and will be based on the popular Halo video game franchise.  The company is also working with the National Football League to develop an app for Xbox that lets players interact with their fantasy football teams while watching a live game. In an interview, Don A. Mattrick, the president of Microsoft’s interactive entertainment business, said that he recognized the growing appeal of mobile devices for gaming and that Microsoft would aggressively tie smartphones and tablets into the experience of using its console. He became most animated when talking about the possibilities of the new Xbox for providers of video programming. “We’re going to the take the form from a one-way experience pushed through a straw to where you can communicate back and make it interactive,” Mr. Mattrick said.  Even if it is a wild success, the new Xbox is likely to have a bigger impact on consumer perception than it will on Microsoft’s overall sales. The Xbox remains a small slice of the company’s business, which is still dominated by sales of Windows, Office and other software. The company’s games division represented only 4 percent of its operating profit. At an event in a carnival tent on its corporate campus, Microsoft did not say how much the new system would cost or how publishing partners would charge for games, which typically start at around $60 for high-end game consoles.  A major feature of the new Xbox, which is expected to hit store shelves in time for the holiday season, will be a new generation of Kinect, the camera-based motion-control sensor introduced several years ago as an Xbox 360 accessory. The new Kinect will come with every Xbox One. Traditional retail sales of games have come under pressure in recent years as mobile devices like the iPhone and iPad have invaded their turf with free and low-cost games. While many gamers dismiss those offerings as inferior to console games, the games have nevertheless tapped into a huge audience of players who may never have played on an Xbox or Sony’s PlayStation. The games business could use a jolt. Total United States retail sales of game hardware and software fell 25 percent to $495.2 million in April from $657.5 million a year earlier, according to estimates by NPD Group, a research firm. That figure does not include the sale of downloadable content over the Internet. Alex St. John, an entrepreneur who worked on Microsoft’s pre-Xbox game efforts, says he is pessimistic about prospects for gaming consoles. “They’re coming out with the latest and greatest stone tool,” Mr. St. John said. “The new console that trumps the old console is called the Apple iPad. This generation of kids loves mobile games.”"

                "Three months after surprising the video game industry with strong sales of its first console, the Microsoft Corporation will dispatch its chairman, Bill Gates, to Tokyo this week to introduce its assault on an inhospitable Japanese market. Not since the industry's early days, when Atari competed for space in video arcades, has a major American game company tried to dethrone Japanese hardware makers on their own turf. When it begins selling its Xbox game system in Japan on Friday, Microsoft will try to use the star power of Mr. Gates and a lineup of specialized games to battle the leaders, Sony and Nintendo. Many industry insiders predict that the Xbox, which has sold more than 1.5 million units in North America since November, will face tough going in Japan, where American software companies have found tremendous difficulties merely putting their games onto store shelves. ''You are talking about a closed market and going up against two very strong, very entrenched competitors,'' said Heath A. Terry, a game software analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston. ''For Microsoft to expect significant success early on in that market is unrealistic.'' The Xbox has other strikes against it for Japanese consumers, who buy about a third of the world's game products. Analysts worry that the console is too big for the living room in a country where smaller gadgets rule. And at about $260, the Xbox costs $40 more than Sony's PlayStation2 and $75 more than Nintendo's GameCube. Yet analysts and software makers acknowledge that Microsoft, the world's No. 1 software company, managed the North American rollout of the Xbox better than they had expected. They also noted that it has deep pockets and has shown unflagging persistence in entering other businesses. The company has already made one significant adjustment specifically for Japan: after criticism from early testers, it built smaller game controllers, with buttons closer together, to better fit the hands of the average Japanese player. Peter Moore, president and chief operating officer for Sega of America, the American division of the Japanese games publisher, said Microsoft's early success in North America gave the company a fighting chance in Japan and Europe, where the Xbox goes on sale on March 14. ''It's eerily reminiscent of the power of the launch of the PlayStation,'' he said, referring to Sony's first console. ''The way a powerful global company can attack an industry, get under its skin and change an industry.'' Hirohisa Ohura, who runs Microsoft's Xbox division in Japan, said the North American introduction had proved that the company could compete in the video game business. While calling Japan ''the most challenging market'' for the Xbox, he said Microsoft would keep chipping away at its competitors for the loyalty of Japanese game players. ''U.S. companies coming into Japan as a game vendor tended to fail and walk away real quick,'' Mr. Ohura said. ''We're not willing to give up at any point. Once we're in this business, we're in here to win.'' In its quest for the buzz that makes or breaks video games, Microsoft set up hundreds of Xbox kiosks in Tokyo and Osaka earlier this month. And for the introduction on Friday, Mr. Gates himself will stump for the Xbox at an event similar to his appearance last November at the opening of the Toys ''R'' Us store in Times Square. Microsoft began taking advance orders on Feb. 2 for consoles, including 50,000 special edition systems with a translucent case and a silver-plated key chain engraved with the autograph of Mr. Gates -- an accessory that has been mocked on online message boards and game publications. Sony, the consumer electronics giant, has an enormous head start on Microsoft. By Dec. 31, Sony said, it had shipped 25 million of its next-generation consoles, the PlayStation2, including 10 million to North America and 8 million to Japan. ''The burden isn't on our company to compete with them; the burden is significantly on Microsoft to compete with us,'' said Molly Smith, a spokeswoman for Sony Computer Entertainment America, the company's American division. The list of best-selling software is dominated by titles that run on the PlayStation2. Yet while they have capitalized on Sony's success in North America, large American game publishers have found the Japanese market difficult to penetrate and have been forced to cooperate with Japanese publishers to develop games specifically for Japan and have games sold there. Electronic Arts is the No. 1 publisher of PlayStation2 titles in North America, but only No. 7 in Japan. ''The secret in Japan is getting product that's culturally appealing to Japanese consumers,'' said Stan McKee, chief financial officer of Electronic Arts. Microsoft has forged partnerships of its own with more than 90 Japanese publishers, but still faces an uphill battle. Because of Sony's lead, analysts said, Microsoft will consider its introduction a success if it wins close to 20 percent of the Japanese market."

                "Reaching out to millions of aspiring game developers around the world, Microsoft plans today to announce a contest that will award $10,000 and the opportunity to entice millions of eyeballs to the next great digital diversion for the company’s Xbox 360. In addition to the game console’s snazzy graphics, the Xbox Live online service has been the most important component of the Xbox 360’s success since its debut in 2005. And perhaps the most popular aspect of Xbox Live has been the service’s arcade component, which allows users to download and play smaller, relatively simpler games like Uno and Geometry Wars that usually cost less than $10. (By contrast, top-end games can sell in stores for around $60.) The popularity of Xbox Live Arcade has in turn attracted the attention of game developers looking to create the next Tetris or Minesweeper. Late last year, Microsoft introduced a suite of software tools for making so-called casual games called XNA.  And so at a game makers’ convention in San Francisco, Microsoft plans to announce a contest akin to the television show “Project Greenlight” that will award a cash prize and a potential slot on Xbox Live Arcade to the best new game created with XNA tools. The company intends to announce the winner of the contest, called “Dream-Build-Play,” in August.  “This competition highlights the power of XNA and the popularity of the Xbox Live Arcade service with its millions of users,” Aaron Greenberg, Microsoft’s group product manager for the Xbox 360 and Xbox Live, said in a telephone interview.  To help increase the popularity of casual games, Microsoft will also announce the introduction of a new 512-megabyte portable storage device for the Xbox 360. The previous portable storage unit contained only 64 megabytes of data, and so Xbox Live Arcade games had been limited to an official size of 50 megabytes. With the new unit, Microsoft will also raise the official size limit on Xbox Live Arcade games to 150 megabytes, allowing enhanced graphics, sound and artificial intelligence. SETH SCHIESEL"

                "Raising the ante in the video game wars, Microsoft is bringing out a new version of the Xbox 360 game machine that has a bigger hard drive, better high-definition video support and a stylish black finish, not an insignificant feature in a world where looking cool ranks high. The idea is to appeal to an elite class of hardcore game players who would like a little more of everything.   “Today’s games-and-entertainment enthusiast has an insatiable appetite for digital high-definition content,” said Peter Moore, corporate vice president for Microsoft’s interactive entertainment business, in Redmond, Wash.   The Xbox 360 Elite, which is to be announced today and will be in stores in late April, will have a list price of $479, or $80 more than the Xbox 360 Pro and $180 more than the basic Xbox 360. The new model has a 120-gigabyte hard drive, in contrast to the standard model’s 20-gigabyte drive. It also has a high-definition multimedia interface port and cable and a wireless controller and headset. Current Xbox 360 owners can buy the new 120-gigabyte hard drive as a separate accessory for $179.  Microsoft is clearly hoping to fill what it sees as a hole at the top end of the market. The Nintendo Wii has been outselling the PlayStation 3 from Sony and the Xbox 360 in recent months, but that system is largely positioned as a family-friendly game machine that can be purchased for $50 less than the lowest-priced Xbox. The Sony system is priced higher than both the Nintendo and the Microsoft systems, with the cheapest model priced at $499.  Both Microsoft and Sony have positioned their consoles as entertainment hubs, not just for playing sophisticated video games but also for listening to music and viewing downloaded movies and television shows.   John Rodman, group product manager for the Xbox platform and Xbox Live, pointed to a recent Microsoft survey that revealed that nearly 40 percent of the time that Xbox 360 users spent with their consoles was for activities other than gaming.   Yet when it comes to gaming, Xbox 360 users are serious, Mr. Rodman says. Six out of 10 Xbox 360 users use Xbox Live, Microsoft’s online gaming service.   “We don’t feel like the Wii customer and the Xbox customer are the same thing,” he said. “We think that as soon as the Wii customer turns 14 they want something else.”  James L. McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester Research, said that Microsoft hoped to encourage customers to spend more money downloading movies and games, which require considerable hard-drive space. "

                "LOS ANGELES  Reaching out beyond hardcore video game players to everyday consumers, Microsoft outlined an entertainment strategy on Monday for making the company’s Xbox 360 game console a gateway for movies, television and social networking. In a media presentation on the eve of E3, the video game industry’s biggest North American convention, Microsoft announced new relationships with the social networking giants Facebook and Twitter as well as Sky, the big British satellite television provider that is a unit of the News Corporation.  Microsoft announced that Facebook users would be able to access their profiles and share photos on their television through the Xbox Live network and that Twitter devotees would also be able to post and read messages through the service.  More far-reaching was Microsoft’s new deal with Sky, under which Xbox Live users in Britain will be able to watch live television, including professional soccer, over an Internet version of the Sky service. Not every channel available over satellite will be available over Xbox Live, but the offering will include dozens of stations, Microsoft executives said. Users will be able to watch television in a virtual party room with their friends, discussing the program as they are watching, they said.  Microsoft has long sought a bigger role in home television, going so far in years past as to try to build its own set-top box business. Partnering with Sky represents a back door into the television market. The company has also recognized how Nintendo has expanded the traditional audience for video games with its innovative motion-sensitive controller for the Wii. Microsoft provided the first public demonstration of its futuristic Project Natal, which it hopes will usher in an age of completely controller-free gaming.  Using a sophisticated camera, infrared sensors and voice recognition software, Natal allows users to control a game or other programs, like a virtual painting studio, merely by waving their arms, speaking to the system and moving around. Microsoft did not say when the technology would become available. Microsoft also demonstrated some of its coming big games, including Forza Motorsport 3, the suspense-thriller Alan Wake and a new version of its biggest hit, Halo. Hideo Kojima, the developer behind the Metal Gear series, said that the next major installment in that franchise would be available for Xbox 360, a coup for Microsoft because previous Metal Gear games had been exclusive to Sony game machines."

                " NEW YORK — Buyers of the Xbox 360, Microsoft's second-generation video game console, will expect to play big, expensive marquee games like \"Call of Duty 2\" from Activision and \"Madden NFL 06\" by Electronic Arts. But Microsoft is also banking on them to play small arcade-style video games, purchased and downloaded from the Internet. Unlike its competitors, the Sony PlayStation 2 and Nintendo GameCube, the new Xbox, which goes on sale on Nov. 22, can play games on two separate tracks. One is the familiar terrain of big-budget, deeply immersive games that feel more like interactive movies than games. The other is a return to the video game's arcade roots. But the arcade games are not simple, said Greg Canessa, group manager of Xbox Live Arcade, part of the Xbox division.\"Arcade games are really miniature Xbox 360 games,\" he said. The price is somewhat miniaturized as well. To develop the arcade games cost $100,000 to $200,000, compared with $15 million to $20 million for the larger games. The arcade games will be sold only online, downloadable through the Xbox's broadband-only Internet connection. Microsoft has not officially announced prices for the games, but it is widely expected that they will cost $5 to $10. By contrast, new Xbox games sold at retailers like Best Buy are likely to cost $60, or about $10 more than previous Xbox games, according to some game publishers. The new machines, slimmer and more powerful than the original Xbox released in 2001, will cost $300 for a basic model and $400 for a model with a 20-gigabyte hard drive. They will also be able to play DVDs, CDs and standard music files, including MP3 and Windows Media Audio files, as well as display digital snapshots on a TV screen. Those functions and the arcade-type gaming feature are central to Microsoft's strategy to reach a broader family market, beyond the young male players who have been the Xbox's primary audience.To do that, Peter Moore, vice president for marketing at Xbox International, said Microsoft would eliminate the need for credit cards in making online purchases of games, accessories and upgrades. Instead of credit cards, the Xbox Live online service will accept Microsoft value cards that can be bought in various denominations online or at retail and convenience stores, Moore said. The value cards would function, in effect, like tokens in an arcade. \"We have to get credit cards out of the way,\" he said. \"We've got to broaden this to younger demographics.\" Another big selling point for the 360 is its enhanced Internet connectivity through the Xbox Live service.Microsoft will give Xbox 360 owners a free subscription to Xbox Live Silver, which gives players access to the online system's features, including the ability to buy and download games. A Gold membership, at $50 a year, permits users to play games with others over the Internet. Canessa, the group manager of Xbox Live Arcade, said that each arcade game could play at 1080i high definition and that most could take advantage of the 360's ability to communicate with other players over a broadband Internet connection. \"We will have from 12 to 15 games by launch,\" Canessa said. At least 75 percent, he added, will be capable of being played live online by more than one player.Each Xbox 360, he said, will include a free copy of the full version of \"Hexic HD,\" an arcade-style puzzle game developed by Alexey Pajitnov, the creator of \"Tetris.\" \"We created a whole market, a whole new world, for downloadable games,\" Canessa said. While online arcade games have proved popular on personal computers, Canessa said he believed that the 360's embrace of arcade games would further invigorate independent game design. \"The indie game developers is one of the opportunities I'm most excited about,\" he said. \"You have small, independent, three guys in a garage making games, totally innovating. It's the Sundance Film Festival, if you will, of games.\" "

                " SEATTLE — In a bid to make its games unit profitable by 2007, Microsoft is planning to start selling a more expensive version of its Xbox game console this autumn. The premium Xbox 360 console will sell for $399.99 in the United States, nearly three times the price of the current Xbox, according to an announcement made by Microsoft on Wednesday. The premium console will sell for399.99, or $490.67, in Continental Europe, while its scaled-back version, called \"Xbox 360 Core System,\" will sell for $299.99 in the United States and299.99 in Europe. Microsoft is counting on the new releases of its console to make its video game unit profitable by 2007, according to Robert Bach, senior vice president for Microsoft's home and entertainment division. The game unit of Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, has lost $2.8 billion in the last three years, while Sony's rival console, the PlayStation, is profitable. Bach predicted that the Xbox 360 would outsell Sony's PlayStation 3, which is scheduled for release next year, even though the PlayStation 2 has outsold the Xbox by nearly 4 to 1. Various Xbox accessories, like a 20-gigabyte detachable hard drive and a wireless controller that will be delivered with the premium version of the console, will also be available for purchase as an add-on for the less expensive \"core\" console. Microsoft is also planning to sell other Xbox accessories, like a wireless controller and TV remote, a headset for the Xbox Live online service and an Ethernet cable for high-speed Internet connections. The company said that it remained on target to ship the new Xbox to stores in North America, Europe and Japan in time for the upcoming holiday season, ahead of Sony's PlayStation 3, which is slated to replace the PlayStation 2 in the spring. Bach noted that both new versions of the Xbox would support high-definition visuals and play music and movies. These features were not part of the original Xbox release, which cost $299 four years ago but now sells for $150. Matt Rosoff, an analyst at the independent research firm Directions on Microsoft, said he doubted that enthusiasts would balk at the price increase for the new releases.\"Hard-core gamers will be on board,\" Rosoff said. \"I think the sticker shock might be in the larger audience Microsoft is trying to reach,\" like casual game players and neophytes, he added. Microsoft sells its current Xbox console at a loss because its primary goal was to break into the lucrative game market. It makes money selling games, but does not expect its home and entertainment division to post profits regularly until 2007. \"They need to not lose a lot of money on the console this time,\" said Ben Bajarin, an analyst at Creative Strategies in Campbell, California. \"They'd like to get closer to a small margin of profit on the console.\" The core console will not be able to play games designed for the original Xbox unless a consumer spends $99.99 to add a hard drive. Microsoft has asked developers working on future games to make them in such a way that they could be played on both the fully loaded and basic versions of the console. Pricing for the new Xbox in Japan, where Microsoft sells just a few hundred consoles a week, will not be announced until the Tokyo Game Show in September, Bach said. "

                " SAN JOSE, California — The tit-for- tat battle for customers between Sony and Microsoft continued Thursday as the Japanese electronics group announced plans to introduce an online gaming service when its PlayStation 3 video game console is released in the fall. The news of the service, which lets users buy games and communicate and compete with other players via the Web, comes days after Tokyo-based Sony said that it would delay the release of its next-generation PlayStationconsole until November, putting it a year behind Microsoft's popular Xbox 360. The much-awaited start had originally been scheduled for the spring and the news, on March 15, prompted Microsoft to announce this week that it was more than doubling shipments of the Xbox 360. Phil Harrison, president of worldwide studios for Sony Computer Entertainment, said that the basic level of Sony's online service, known internally as PlayStation Network Platform, would be free, and would allow users to play against each other online, e-mail and chat with friends. Additional game services and premium content will be made available to users who pay a subscription fee, Harrison said. Sony, one of the world's leading technology manufacturers and entertainment companies, is hoping to retain its dominance over the roughly $30 billion global video game market with the PS3. Microsoft introduced the Xbox 360 game console in November. The company's Xbox Live subscription service, which offers game downloads and online play, has been a hit on the new machine and Sony had been widely expected to offer a similar service. Built in collaboration with Sony Online Entertainment, which already offers PC game downloads and a marketplace for trading virtual assets, the service was inspired by businesses like the online auction site eBay and the online retailer Amazon.com, where communities of users contribute ratings and recommendations. It also steals a page from social networking sites like Myspace.com, which has attracted millions of users. \"We have to fall into step with consumer expectations,\" said Harrison, who said the social aspects of the network promise to get people more involved in gaming. With broadband adoption on the rise and television viewership dropping, advertisers are exploring the possibility of buying ad space in games much like they now do on the Web. \"This can provide a tremendous revenue stream for our industry,\" Harrison said. Video game makers, which have seen sales fall as gamers wait and save for new consoles, have been under pressure to find new ways to offset rising game development costs. Microsoft said Tuesday that Xbox Live had logged more than 10 million downloads.More than 85 percent of Xbox 360 consoles that are connected to the Internet have downloaded games, trailers and videos from the subscription service, Microsoft said. Downloads appeal to many game makers, because they can cut costs by selling direct to consumers. Online distribution also gives them a way to head off piracy and used game sales by providing a way to check that the player of a game is also its owner. Anita Frazier, an analyst with NPD Group, a market research company, said most publishers were \"treading lightly\" into direct online sales of games because they do not want to alienate retailers, but added that such services would likely open the market for more games.$@ "

                "Executives at Microsoft are fond of saying that its subscription gaming service, Xbox Live, should be thought of as a cable channel. They want Xbox to be seen not merely as a gaming machine for teenagers, but as a media portal for parents and grandparents, too. The company is even producing shows for users: it is in the middle of the second season of “1 vs. 100,” an interactive version of a game show that was on NBC. The content ambitions do not end there. Microsoft has held in-depth talks with the Walt Disney Company about a programming deal with ESPN, according to people close to the talks, who requested anonymity because the talks were intended to be private. For a per-subscriber fee, ESPN could provide live streams of sporting events, similar to the ones available through ESPN 360, a service that is available from some high-speed Internet providers. Microsoft could also create some interactive games in association with ESPN, the people said. One of the people said the deal was not imminent. The companies declined to comment. Already, video game consoles are putting a new emphasis on the video, rather than the game.  The roughly 20 million monthly members of Xbox Live can surf Facebook, browse an online mall of movies and TV episodes and, if they pay, watch Netflix.  “It’s 20 million connected living rooms,” said Marc Whitten, the general manager of Xbox Live. Similarly, users of the Sony PlayStation can tune into BBC shows and see Weather Channel updates, as well as stream Netflix. Last week, Netflix extended its streaming service to the Nintendo Wii.  Among the many companies that want to transport the on-demand qualities of the Internet into the living room  the over-the-top model, in industry parlance  the console makers have a significant head start. Nearly 60 percent of American homes now have at least one console, according to the consulting firm Deloitte, up from 44 percent three years ago. “For both of the big guys, it’s about extending the value of the hardware platform,” said Mike McGuire, a vice president for the research firm Gartner, referring to Microsoft and Sony. “The devices are hooked to TVs and have broadband connections, and there are more and more opportunities to license movies and TV shows and deliver them in over-the-top models.” Microsoft said this month that it had sold 39 million Xbox 360 consoles around the world. About half sign into Xbox Live each month. At that size, “it starts to feel like a cable network,” said Mark Kroese, who oversees Xbox advertising sales for Microsoft. The company does not specify how many members pay for access to premium services like Netflix; basic functions of Xbox Live are free. The company says it regularly counts more than a million concurrent users  and topped out at 2.2 million at one point during Christmas week last month. That compares favorably to some of the top channels on cable, like TBS and the Cartoon Network, which reach about one million viewers at any given time, according to the Nielsen Company.  The comparisons are crude at best because many of Xbox Live’s users are playing games rather than watching video. No third-party measurement exists, because ratings companies like Nielsen do not yet track the service fully. But there is no doubt that consoles are expanding their domain, something that is evident in Mr. Whitten’s vision of the service: “The entertainment you want, the people you care about, wherever you are.” The addition of Netflix in late 2008 was an important step into the entertainment arena for Xbox, and perhaps a precursor to Microsoft’s current talks with Hollywood producers. Without releasing specific numbers, Mr. Whitten said the streaming movies and TV service were “very, very popular,” including in his own household. Mr. Whitten said Microsoft wanted to be a bigger player in television and film viewing. He declined to comment on the conversations with Disney but said more than once that “there’s going to be a ton of experimentation around business models and rights.” “Our goal is, really, how can we get as much content there as possible,” he said. Disney is not alone in showing an interest in the console market. Many companies sell TV episodes and film rentals through Microsoft’s online store, and Web video ventures are clamoring to have a place on the service. Console makers have a long way to go to be considered replacements for cable subscriptions, but, at the very least, they could put a dent in the time spent viewing traditional TV. The interactive game show “1 vs. 100” drew well over 100,000 concurrent users at times during its first season last year, according to Microsoft’s internal data. During the second season, which began in November, two-hour TV-style trivia competitions are scheduled on Tuesday and Friday nights. A voice-over announcer, shown onscreen as an avatar, provides live color commentary. Like the defunct NBC show, the game has a contestant, “The One,” and a “Mob” of 100 other players. Members of the audience can watch passively or play along, improving their odds of being picked to play for prizes. Unlike on the live-action TV show, every player on Xbox is represented by a cartoonish avatar. Dave McCarthy, a general manager at Microsoft Game Studios, said the scheduled TV-style shows provided a guarantee that “you’re a part of something bigger.” Beyond the game show realm, Microsoft also exclusively shows “The Guild,” a sitcom that it bills as “Seinfeld” meets video game culture. It stars its creator, the actress Felicia Day, and is sponsored by Sprint. For advertisers like Sprint, online communities like Xbox Live are another arena to pursue consumers. Within “1 vs. 100” there are 15- and 30-second commercial breaks like on TV. Those spots account for about 15 percent of the service’s advertising revenue; most of the rest comes from ads on Xbox Live navigation pages, like display ads on Web sites.  In November, Nielsen started to track “1 vs. 100” play and ad views. The pilot program “is the tip of the iceberg,” said Gerardo Guzman, a director for Nielsen Games; eventually, he hopes to generate TV-style ratings. Mr. Kroese said Xbox advertisers were “very interested in being able to compare the media buy on Xbox to other media buys they do.” Microsoft says nearly half of Xbox Live members use its entertainment content; the rest mostly play multiplayer games. But it expects that more of its users will try the entertainment side and the line between them will blur further. “I don’t think there’s a real difference between a game and ‘Lost.’ Or a game and ‘American Idol.’ They’re all ways we spend our leisure time,” Mr. Whitten said.  Over time, he predicted, “these narrow swim lanes  games, music, movies, etc.  will dissolve.”"

                "Executives at Microsoft are fond of saying that its subscription gaming service, Xbox Live, should be thought of as a cable channel. They want Xbox to be seen not merely as a gaming machine for teenagers, but as a media portal for parents and grandparents, too. The company is even producing shows for users: it is in the middle of the second season of “1 vs. 100,” an interactive version of a game show that was on NBC. The content ambitions do not end there. Microsoft has held in-depth talks with the Walt Disney Company about a programming deal with ESPN, according to people close to the talks, who requested anonymity because the talks were intended to be private. For a per-subscriber fee, ESPN could provide live streams of sporting events, similar to the ones available through ESPN 360, a service that is available from some high-speed Internet providers. Microsoft could also create some interactive games in association with ESPN, the people said. One of the people said the deal was not imminent. The companies declined to comment. Already, video game consoles are putting a new emphasis on the video, rather than the game.  The roughly 20 million monthly members of Xbox Live can surf Facebook, browse an online mall of movies and TV episodes and, if they pay, watch Netflix.  “It’s 20 million connected living rooms,” said Marc Whitten, the general manager of Xbox Live. Similarly, users of the Sony PlayStation can tune into BBC shows and see Weather Channel updates, as well as stream Netflix. Last week, Netflix extended its streaming service to the Nintendo Wii.  Among the many companies that want to transport the on-demand qualities of the Internet into the living room  the over-the-top model, in industry parlance  the console makers have a significant head start. Nearly 60 percent of American homes now have at least one console, according to the consulting firm Deloitte, up from 44 percent three years ago. “For both of the big guys, it’s about extending the value of the hardware platform,” said Mike McGuire, a vice president for the research firm Gartner, referring to Microsoft and Sony. “The devices are hooked to TVs and have broadband connections, and there are more and more opportunities to license movies and TV shows and deliver them in over-the-top models.” Microsoft said this month that it had sold 39 million Xbox 360 consoles around the world. About half sign into Xbox Live each month. At that size, “it starts to feel like a cable network,” said Mark Kroese, who oversees Xbox advertising sales for Microsoft. The company does not specify how many members pay for access to premium services like Netflix; basic functions of Xbox Live are free. The company says it regularly counts more than a million concurrent users  and topped out at 2.2 million at one point during Christmas week last month. That compares favorably to some of the top channels on cable, like TBS and the Cartoon Network, which reach about one million viewers at any given time, according to the Nielsen Company.  The comparisons are crude at best because many of Xbox Live’s users are playing games rather than watching video. No third-party measurement exists, because ratings companies like Nielsen do not yet track the service fully. But there is no doubt that consoles are expanding their domain, something that is evident in Mr. Whitten’s vision of the service: “The entertainment you want, the people you care about, wherever you are.” The addition of Netflix in late 2008 was an important step into the entertainment arena for Xbox, and perhaps a precursor to Microsoft’s current talks with Hollywood producers. Without releasing specific numbers, Mr. Whitten said the streaming movies and TV service were “very, very popular,” including in his own household. Mr. Whitten said Microsoft wanted to be a bigger player in television and film viewing. He declined to comment on the conversations with Disney but said more than once that “there’s going to be a ton of experimentation around business models and rights.” “Our goal is, really, how can we get as much content there as possible,” he said. Disney is not alone in showing an interest in the console market. Many companies sell TV episodes and film rentals through Microsoft’s online store, and Web video ventures are clamoring to have a place on the service. Console makers have a long way to go to be considered replacements for cable subscriptions, but, at the very least, they could put a dent in the time spent viewing traditional TV. The interactive game show “1 vs. 100” drew well over 100,000 concurrent users at times during its first season last year, according to Microsoft’s internal data. During the second season, which began in November, two-hour TV-style trivia competitions are scheduled on Tuesday and Friday nights. A voice-over announcer, shown onscreen as an avatar, provides live color commentary. Like the defunct NBC show, the game has a contestant, “The One,” and a “Mob” of 100 other players. Members of the audience can watch passively or play along, improving their odds of being picked to play for prizes. Unlike on the live-action TV show, every player on Xbox is represented by a cartoonish avatar. Dave McCarthy, a general manager at Microsoft Game Studios, said the scheduled TV-style shows provided a guarantee that “you’re a part of something bigger.” Beyond the game show realm, Microsoft also exclusively shows “The Guild,” a sitcom that it bills as “Seinfeld” meets video game culture. It stars its creator, the actress Felicia Day, and is sponsored by Sprint. For advertisers like Sprint, online communities like Xbox Live are another arena to pursue consumers. Within “1 vs. 100” there are 15- and 30-second commercial breaks like on TV. Those spots account for about 15 percent of the service’s advertising revenue; most of the rest comes from ads on Xbox Live navigation pages, like display ads on Web sites.  In November, Nielsen started to track “1 vs. 100” play and ad views. The pilot program “is the tip of the iceberg,” said Gerardo Guzman, a director for Nielsen Games; eventually, he hopes to generate TV-style ratings. Mr. Kroese said Xbox advertisers were “very interested in being able to compare the media buy on Xbox to other media buys they do.” Microsoft says nearly half of Xbox Live members use its entertainment content; the rest mostly play multiplayer games.

                "LOS ANGELES, July 5 — In what may be one of the costliest consumer warranty repairs in history, Microsoft announced on Thursday that it would spend up to $1.15 billion to repair failing Xbox 360 game machine consoles. While the company would not say how many units were failing, Robbie Bach, president of Microsoft’s entertainment and devices division, said that there have been an “unacceptable high number of repairs.” The majority of Xbox 360 owners, he said, have not experienced hardware failure.  Company officials said that Microsoft had sold 11.6 million Xbox 360 units by the end of June, shy of the 12 million units the company had predicted. The Xbox 360, which first went of sale in November 2005, is currently the best-selling game machine in the United States, according to NPD, a market research firm. The size of the anticipated repair bill suggests that a third to as many as half of the machines are flawed.  Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., said it would take a charge of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion against earnings in the quarter ended June 30. Consumers know they have a problem if three red flashing lights appear on the console. Gamers on online forums have been referring to the event as “the Red Ring of Death” because the machine then shuts down.  The company declined to explain the nature of the failure, but said that it was not caused by a single problem in the console, which it said contained 1,700 components and 500 million transistors. The company also said there were no health or safety concerns involved. The problem began to appear over the last three to four months, Mr. Bach said, after “significant usage” of the consoles. He said the company has taken steps to correct the problem in new devices. Microsoft said it would extend the warranty of the game console to three years to customers worldwide. Previously, products sold in the United States were covered by a one-year warranty, while Xbox 360 units sold in Europe had a two-year warranty.  In addition, customers who have had their consoles repaired because of the “three flashing lights” problem will be reimbursed for the cost of the repairs. Microsoft has succeeded in establishing the Xbox brand against the better known Sony PlayStation and other game machines. The Xbox and its successor, the Xbox 360, was the software maker’s first major foray into hardware. Although sales are small relative to the rest of Microsoft’s revenue, the Xbox has been an important venture for the company and was viewed by many analysts as Microsoft’s attempt to compete with the likes of Sony and Apple for control of electronics and entertainment within homes.  The device can be used to access the Internet and view movies. Microsoft said its entertainment and devices division reported an operating loss of $315 million on $929 million in revenue for the three-month period that ended in March, and analysts have estimated that the company lost about $6 billion getting a foothold in the game machine industry.  A new Xbox 360 with a 20-gigabyte hard drive sells for about $400, but other versions cost about $300.  The announcement comes on the eve of the E3 Media and Business Summit, the video-game industry’s major trade show, to be held next week in Los Angeles. “This is bound to affect discussions between Microsoft and its developers and retailers,” said Richard Doherty, a partner in the research company Envisioneering Group."

                "One of the enduring attractions of comic books and graphic novels is the ease with which they explain the universe. Evil is identifiable, external and fairly simple to vanquish with the application of the appropriate superpowers. And sometimes, as in the case of ABC Family’s new comic-based series “The Middleman,” evil is downright funny. In “Middleman’s” first episode, last week, a slimy, many-eyed, multitentacled creature erupts in a DNA lab. Later, evil’s personification is a mobster ape with a machine gun. These over-the-top creatures are more comic than threatening. Usually the phrase “cartoonish violence” is a pejorative; here it’s a compliment. “The Middleman,” written as a graphic novel by Javier Grillo-Marxuach, who has also written for the series “Lost” and “Medium,” stars Matt Keeslar in the title role, a straight-arrow, milk-drinking former member of the Navy Seals who stands between us and horrors we’re not even aware of, fighting evil “so you don’t have to.” He dresses like a Canadian Mountie and delivers his lines with the stone-face confidence of a young Peter Graves. Early on, he explains the world to his protégée. “You know how in comic books there’s all kinds of mad scientists and aliens and androids and monsters who want to either take over or destroy the world?” he asks. “Well, it really does work like that.” This is news to Wendy Watson (Natalie Morales), an art-school graduate and temp secretary whose calm in the face of the multitentacled slime creature  she stabs it with a letter opener  inspires the Middleman to recruit her. “You’re good under pressure,” he says. She asks, “Are you hitting on me?” There is some sexual tension between these two, but you hope it won’t become a big part of the story; there’s much more interesting material here. “Middleman” is full of hilarious throwaways, as when our hero, preparing to drink a glass of “cool refreshing milk” with some bad guys, empties his pockets  of grenades, flamethrowers and a crossbow.  The genius is in the details. When the Middleman asks Wendy if she has experience with firearms, and she says she’s a pacifist, he looks at her fingers. Their calluses tell him that she is a veteran Xbox player. “You probably have better hand-eye than a bush sniper,” he concludes. “Middleman” skillfully incorporates real-life details into its fantastic scenarios. Its characters aren’t just Manichaean warriors; they also live the kinds of lives that people read comic books to escape from. “Did I get any calls?” Wendy asks her roommate after a rough day at the office. The roommate says: “Yeah. Your mom called to ask if you’re a lesbian.” That would be the mom whom Wendy describes as “on me 24/7 to quit painting, move back to Orlando, meet a good man, eat fried foods, swell up like a tick and start squeezing out calves like Elsie mainlining fertility drugs.” Then there’s the motive of the mad scientist who created the gun-toting ape; she’s just trying to compensate for federal cuts to her research grants. Saving the world is easy; making a world as complex and funny as this one is the real feat of “Middleman.” THE MIDDLEMAN ABC Family, Monday nights at 8, Eastern and Pacific times; 7, Central time. Created by Javier Grillo-Marxuach, based on his Viper Comics graphic novels, with illustrations by Les McClaine; directed by Jeremiah Chechik; Mr. Grillo-Marxuach and John Ziffren, executive producers; Hans Beimler, co-executive producer; Jon Pare, producer; Sarah Watson, co-producer; Mr. Chechik and Tracey Stern, supervising producers.  WITH: Matt Keeslar (the Middleman), Natalie Morales (Wendy Watson), Mary Pat Gleason (Ida), Brit Morgan (Lacey) and Jake Smollett (Noser)."

                "TOKYO, Dec. 16 - In the United States, Microsoft's Xbox 360 video game console has been so popular it is hard to keep on store shelves. But in Tokyo's neon-drenched Akihabara neighborhood, known as Electronics Town, there are plenty of the sleek white machines to go around, if you can find takers. At Yodobashi Camera, an eight-story electronics department store selling everything from hair curlers to home computer servers, a small corner display of Xbox 360's draws little attention from passing shoppers. It is not hard to figure out why. Lined up on a rack near the display are the only nine games sold for Xbox 360. But behind it are some 3,000 games, spread across six store aisles, for Microsoft's biggest rival here, the Sony PlayStation 2. \"Xbox doesn't even have Gran Turismo,\" said Shun'ichi Moriizumi, naming a popular auto racing game. One of the few shoppers to stop in front of the Xbox display, Mr. Moriizumi, a 22-year-old university student, said he came to see the Xbox 360, which went on sale here Dec. 10, 18 days after its debut in the United States. \"I like the graphics,\" he said \"But I'm not going to buy it, at least not today. I'm waiting until the new PlayStation comes out before deciding which to buy.\" That appears to be a common sentiment in Japan, the world's second-largest video game market after the United States. The Xbox 360 had a disappointing opening day in Japan. During the first weekend the Xbox 360 was in stores, Microsoft sold 62,135 of about 159,000 machines shipped, or about 39 percent, according to a Japanese market research company, Enterbrain. That pace was even slower than in 2002, when Microsoft introduced its earlier Xbox model in Japan, where it was considered a flop. Microsoft was hoping to make a bigger splash this time, not just because of the market's size here but also because of Japan's importance as a proving ground for new products. Japan is, after all, home to Microsoft's two biggest rivals in video games, Sony and Nintendo, and its software companies write many of the games played worldwide, from Super Mario Brothers to Final Fantasy. Winning over Japan's finicky consumers, who are known to reject games for seemingly minor shortcomings in performance and appearance, represents a coveted seal of approval, analysts say. So far, Microsoft has failed the test. As of June, the latest data available, 470,000 Xbox machines over all have been sold in Japan, versus 13 million in the United States, according to the market research site Famitsu.com. That gave Xbox a mere 2 percent slice of the 22 million game machines sold in Japan. By contrast, Xbox had a 25 percent share of the 52 million machines sold in the United States, according to Famitsu. Analysts say the biggest hurdle the Xbox 360 faces in Japan is the dominance of Sony and to a lesser extent Nintendo. Sony has 81 percent of the Japanese market; Nintendo has most of the rest, according to Famitsu. Worldwide, PlayStation's market share is about 68 percent; Xbox is in second place with 17 percent and Nintendo has the rest. Microsoft had hoped to steal a march by rolling out its next-generation XBox game machine ahead of its two Japanese rivals. Sony plans to sell its newest game console, PlayStation 3, in the spring, though the company will not say exactly when. Nintendo says it will release its new console, Revolution, in 2006. But Microsoft's strategy does not seem to be working, analysts say. One problem they note is that Microsoft introduced Xbox 360 before there was much game software to play on it. That makes the Xbox 360 less attractive next to the vastly larger number of games available for PlayStation. Microsoft says more games are in the pipeline, including the latest version of the popular Dead or Alive, which is supposed to go on sale here later this month. \"We didn't have a rocket start,\" said Asako Miyata, a spokeswoman in Japan for Microsoft. \"But we see sales steadily picking up as more games become available.\" Analysts say, however, that even when more games appear, Microsoft may have trouble luring first-time buyers because of the need to replace their game software libraries. Because so many consumers now own PlayStation 2, it would be easier for them to wait for the arrival of PlayStation 3, which would be able to play all their current games, . \"Sony has such a high penetration rate,\" said John Yang, an electronics analyst in Tokyo for Standard & Poor's rating agency. \"It is not uncommon for households here to have two or even three PS2's,\" he said, referring to the current PlayStation model. \"Why would an entire household want to switch to Xbox?\" Takashi Sudo, a manager for the video game department at the Yodobashi Camera store, said several hundred people showed up for the opening day of Xbox 360 at his store. But he said he expected a crowd at least five times as large for the PlayStation 3 debut in the spring. For that, he says, he will need to set up a line of special booths to handle the crunch. \"This is Sony's country,\" Mr. Sudo said. \"Xbox has to break into a market that Sony built.\""

                "SANTA MONICA, Calif., July 10 — As Microsoft executives played down the impact of an extensive repair program for defective Xbox 360 game machines, they announced several efforts to broaden the appeal of their machine to families.  Opening the annual E3 game conference here, Microsoft executives announced a deal to distribute films from the Walt Disney Company on Microsoft’s Xbox Live Internet service and outlined a broader array of games focused mostly on children and families.  Executives predicted that the company’s recently announced plan to spend up to $1.15 billion to fix defective Xbox 360 game machine would improve, not undermine, the system’s image with consumers.   “The important impact for us is that our customers know we’re going to support the console and support them and if they have issues, we’ll take care of it,” said Robert J. Bach, president of Microsoft’s entertainment and devices division, in an interview. “It won’t change what’s happening in the marketplace because the industry is about the games and we think we have the games that will get people really excited this year.”  As the game industry’s growth has slowed in recent years, game developers have tried to reach beyond the young male players who have been the target audience.  “We believe we have the best game lineup in video-game history for the holiday season,” said Mr. Bach. “You can look top to bottom and we think we have the goods to please any type of gamer.”  Part of Microsoft’s strategy has been to position the Xbox 360 as a living room media hub and an essential element of that plan has been allowing users to download films and television shows to the machine. Adding Disney to the roster of companies distributing movies and video programming over the Xbox Live service should help broaden the appeal of the game system to families with children. The same could be said of the new games Microsoft announced here, including a new installment of the company’s Viva Pinata game and a version of the Scene It? board game. Scene It? will come with a new controller for the Xbox 360 with large buttons and a simple layout that game novices, intimidated by a traditional game controller, may find easier to use “Part of our strategy is we want to win this generation and in order to do that we have to expand beyond the core gamer audience that we’ve had success with and that means appealing to the broad consumer market,” said Shane Kim, general manager of Microsoft Game Studios. The company also said it was developing a keyboard for the Xbox 360 controller. Currently, Xbox Live users send text messages using an on-screen keyboard. The company recently announced plans to integrate the popular Windows Live Messenger service with Xbox Live.  But even as Microsoft hopes to appeal to new sorts of users, the company wants to avoid neglecting the serious player. So Microsoft also said that the next version of the popular Resident Evil series from Capcom of Japan would also be designed to run on the Xbox 360.   In the past, Resident Evil games have run only on Nintendo and Sony consoles. Persuading Capcom to develop games for the Xbox 360 underlines the success Microsoft has had recently in attracting Japanese developers who had shied away from the American console. "

                "AFTER a 31-year-old Manhattan financial executive received Microsoft's Xbox video game system as a gift in January, he walked to a store and bought a half-dozen game titles. The video game industry would have been pleased to hear it. After he played those games a few times against computer-controlled opponents, he got a bit bored and signed up for Microsoft's Xbox Live service, which enabled him to play against other people online. The video game industry, again, would have been pleased. After a few months on the Xbox Live network, in May, he got a bit bored again. This time, however, he opened his Xbox and soldered in a chip that allowed him to change the console's basic computer code and bypass its internal security technology. After installing a new hard drive, he transferred about 3,000 MP3 music files to the system and downloaded illegal copies of 3,500 old-time arcade games. Then he installed the Linux operating system, which allowed him to use the box essentially as a personal computer. Needless to say, the video game industry would not have been pleased. When Microsoft released the Xbox in November 2001, it was heralded as far more than a game machine. Even as the Xbox took aim at Sony's PlayStation 2 game empire, the console was meant to lead Microsoft's broader invasion of the living room. Incorporating a hard drive, which made it more readily adaptable than other consoles, the Xbox had the potential to be a digital-entertainment nerve center. Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, said at the time, ''We're going to put new software that runs on Xbox that, both in the gaming dimension and other dimensions, will amaze people with the power that's in this box.'' That is happening, but not necessarily as Microsoft planned. All sorts of new software is indeed running on Xbox consoles these days, and they are in fact becoming home-entertainment hubs, but it is not Microsoft doing the amazing. Rather, an online confederacy apparently numbering in the thousands -- including accomplished hackers of varied motives and everyday technophiles like the Manhattan financial executive (who shared his experience on the condition of anonymity) -- is taking the lead. Those involved often call their efforts ''unleashing'' or ''unshackling'' -- freeing the Xbox to express its inner PC. Technology industry executives, however, often call such activity a bald attempt to hijack the Xbox illegally. It is a battle that involves many of the ethical and legal issues facing the technology and media industries at this digital moment. What rights do consumers have to tinker with products they own? How far should companies go to protect their intellectual property? What happens when the desires of consumers conflict with the business models of companies they patronize? Who gets to decide just what a particular product may be used for? The Xbox is a particularly attractive target for hackers because while it is essentially a standard PC modified to do only a few things, like play Xbox games, it is much cheaper than a PC. It is like an economy car modified to follow only a few roads -- but one potentially as powerful as a far more expensive model. In the Xbox, that power comes in the form of a 733-megahertz Intel processor, comparable to a midrange personal computer, and sophisticated graphics and audio systems. Its limited operating system, based on a version of Windows, can be used by a programmer to run simple software like a music player -- or the machine can run a new operating system altogether, namely Linux. ''The reality is that if you could bypass Microsoft's operating system you would end up with a fairly powerful computer for less than $200,'' the Manhattan financial executive said. In fact, Microsoft lowered the price for Xbox to $179.99 in May. In a sense, Xbox hackers are exploiting Microsoft's business model, which is to sell Xbox hardware at a loss (to build penetration of the system) and make the money back on royalties from the sale of Xbox software. A PC manufacturer like Dell, meanwhile, has to recoup its costs and generate a profit from the initial sale. So someone who buys the Xbox hardware, modifies it into a general-purpose computer and does not buy Xbox games potentially undermines not only Microsoft but also the personal computer industry. But that is not how some Xbox hackers think about it. ''Especially in Europe, computers are more expensive than they are here, and the Xbox is the cheapest computer you can get,'' Andrew Huang, author of a new book called ''Hacking the Xbox: An Introduction to Reverse Engineering,'' said in a telephone interview. ''Basically,'' he added by e-mail, ''once you have Linux, you have everything.'' It is unclear just how many Xbox hackers there are. Officials of the Interactive Digital Software Association, a trade group of video game publishers, said that Xbox hacking appeared more prevalent in parts of Asia than in North America. Michael Steil, a 24-year-old German who is project leader of a group that calls itself the Xbox Linux Project, said by e-mail that a full version of Linux software for the Xbox had been downloaded more than 220,000 times. Whatever the numbers, Microsoft does not appear eager to discuss Xbox hacking. In recent weeks, a Microsoft public relations representative repeatedly declined to make any company executives available to discuss the matter. Instead, the company issued a statement through a public relations firm that said in part: ''Microsoft is a company passionate about innovation and creativity. We are also very committed to respect for others' intellectual property and we request the same respect applied to our innovations.'' The statement made no reference to the potential use of hacked Xbox consoles as personal computers, saying Microsoft's ''primary concern'' was with the sale of modified chips for the boxes ''that enable game counterfeiting.'' And that is the area that most clearly raises legal issues. Although there are several methods, hacking an Xbox typically involves obtaining a special chip called a modchip, available on the Internet, and soldering it into the machine. (For those who find the process daunting, there are also vendors on the Internet who sell ''pre-modded'' Xbox units.) Modchips, of which there are several varieties, allow users to load new versions of the basic computer code, known as the BIOS, that tells the machine how to operate. A hacked BIOS generally incorporates modified versions of copyrighted Microsoft code and so is generally illegal. The main Web sites that deal with Xbox hacking do not include links to hacked BIOS, and hackers generally find their forbidden fruit in Internet chat rooms. Once the modchip is installed and the BIOS modified, the console can do a number of things it cannot do ''out of the box.'' Xbox games normally must be run from an optical disk, and a hacked Xbox can ''back up'' a game to the unit's hard drive and run the game without the disk. This technique could be used simply to avoid having to insert and remove disks -- or it could be used for piracy (say, by renting a game, putting the software on the hard drive and returning the game). Until passage of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act in 1998, the mere sale of a modified chip would not have appeared illegal. That law, however, prohibits the sale of devices that are primarily meant to circumvent copyright protection. Companies and technologists will fight over the exact legal meaning of those provisions for years. For now, however, the software industry is relying on them. ''Our view over all on modchips is that they are illegal infringing devices, that where we find people engaged in the widespread manufacturing and distribution of them, we and our members, individually and collectively, are committed to doing what we can to shut down their manufacturing and go after the distributors,'' said Doug Lowenstein, president of the Interactive Digital Software Association. Some advocates, however, say that while software piracy is illegal and morally offensive, the mere act of modifying hardware should not be illegal. ''The most important dimension of this debate from our view is that people should have the right to tinker with the stuff that they own,'' said Fred von Lohmann, senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a civil-liberties group in San Francisco. ''Others will say that this is about piracy and all that, but they forget that the principle of tinkering with the stuff that you own was the principle on which the entire personal computer industry was founded,'' he added. ''This is basic business and basic science in the technology world and we think that this right to tinker, this freedom to tinker, remains legally protected.'' For now, however, the federal government seems to agree with Mr. Lowenstein. Last December, David M. Rocci, a 22-year-old from Blacksburg, Va., pleaded guilty to a federal charge of conspiring to import, market and sell modchips for the Xbox. In April, he was sentenced to five months in prison and five months of home detention. Simply from the standpoint of accessibility, the PlayStation 2 would seem to be a more likely candidate for hacking. IDG, the technology research firm, estimates that at the end of last year, 38.1 million PlayStation 2 units were in use in Europe, North America and Japan combined, compared with 6.7 million Xbox units in those regions. In one sense, however, the hacking scene for PlayStation 2 is less developed than the one for Xbox because there is less appetite for it. Sony sells an official conversion kit for the PlayStation 2 that includes a hard drive and allows that system to run the Linux operating system, which in turn allows the system to run MP3's, movies, spreadsheets or any other program or data that works under Linux. It is relatively easy for Sony to embrace Linux because Sony, unlike Microsoft, is not in the operating system business. The PlayStation 2 hacking community seems focused on developing chips that allow PlayStation 2 units to run illegal copies of games and games meant for far-flung parts of the world. (For marketing reasons, many PlayStation 2 games include regional coding, much as DVD's do.) In 2001, Sony sued an Australian for selling modchips that allowed Australian PlayStation 2 units to play games from other parts of the world. After the Australian government argued on the man's behalf, however, the Federal Court of Australia last July ruled mostly against Sony. Mr. von Lohmann said that Microsoft had not been particularly aggressive in combating Xbox hackers but that Sony had actively fought them. A Sony spokeswoman did not respond this week to requests for comment about the company's approach to hackers. For its part, Microsoft, through its public relations agency, indicated that it believed Xbox hackers were a relatively small band. ''Aside from a set of hobbyists,'' it said, ''the vast majority of Xbox owners are not focused on this niche.'' But those who are appear quite focused indeed. By e-mail, Mr. Steil, the German leader of the Xbox Linux project, declared: ''In very simple words: The Xbox is cheaper than a PC. The Xbox is a lot smaller than a PC. The Xbox looks better (next to a TV set). The Xbox is more silent. Therefore it's an ideal Linux computer in the living room.'' That was probably not the vision Mr. Gates had in mind."

                "WHEN the dust finally settled on the 2006 holiday buying season, American consumers — who braved long lines, cold weather and possibly a few kicks to the shins — had spent $3.7 billion on new video-game consoles and software. And while the more than two million youngsters (and not-so-youngsters) who discovered a next-generation gaming system under the Christmas tree — a Microsoft Xbox 360, a Sony PlayStation 3 or a Nintendo Wii — represent a substantial user base for these platforms, they mean even more to the entertainment industry as a whole. To the makers of these video-game systems and to a growing number of film and television studios, they represent a significant new audience for full-length movies and television shows that can be downloaded directly to gaming consoles. In late November Microsoft began expanding the library on its Xbox Live network, a broadband service available by subscription to Xbox 360 owners. In addition to the video-game trailers and playable demonstrations that the network has traditionally offered, you can now find an eclectically selected collection of films and television shows offered for downloading to a console’s hard drive: for a few dollars you can view “Mission: Impossible III” or “Chinatown” or the episode of “Chappelle’s Show” with the blind white supremacist, on your television, just as if you were watching a DVD or a video-on-demand channel.  For gamers with top-shelf home-theater setups, Xbox Live also offers content in high definition: download the HD version of the “Star Trek” episode “Mirror, Mirror,” in which the Enterprise crew is accidentally beamed into a malevolent alternate reality, and you can practically count each strand of hair in evil Mr. Spock’s goatee. This month XBox Live will offer a new view of the corpulent form of Eric Cartman when it becomes the first outlet ever to offer an episode of “South Park” in high definition. While Microsoft acknowledges that most consumers are buying Xbox 360s primarily, if not solely, to play video games, the company also sees an opportunity to use film and television content to draw an audience that doesn’t fit the stereotypical gamer profile.  “The original Xbox was probably the domain of that testosterone-fueled male in the household, and while we love him to death, we also want his little brother and sister and mom and dad and their friends to be able to enjoy it,” said Peter Moore, corporate vice president of Microsoft’s interactive entertainment business division.  To that end Microsoft spent several months negotiating with Hollywood studios and television networks, including Warner Brothers, Paramount, CBS and MTV, to secure a broad variety of programming before rolling out the expanded Xbox Live service.  Although more than 4.5 million Xbox 360s have been sold, and some 60 percent of owners are connected to Xbox Live, the network’s audience will not make broadcast television or movie theaters obsolete any time soon. Yet the kind of content most abundantly available on the network — goofy comedies like “Nacho Libre” and “Zoolander,” clips of Nascar races and adventure films like “Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior” — clearly indicates whom Microsoft expects to make the most use of it: men in their 20s and 30s with enough disposable income to buy lots of video games.  “This guy is typically not going to the movies, and more often than not he’s not watching television, he’s playing games in the living room,” Mr. Moore said. “He’s a difficult person to get to in the first place.”  It is Xbox Live’s potential to deliver such a narrowly defined and increasingly difficult-to-reach demographic that makes it so enticing to the entertainment industry. “This is, to a large extent, an entirely new audience for us,” said Steve Beeks, the president of Lionsgate, an independent studio whose library includes horror movies like “The Descent” and the “Saw” franchise and which recently announced it would make its films available for download on Xbox Live. “These are active buyers of games, but we don’t believe they’ve been active buyers of movies. We’re turning them into consumers of films.”  For television networks whose programming appears on the service, Xbox Live offers the additional benefit of a precise metric to determine how many gamers are downloading their shows and how many are then seeking out these shows on broadcast television.  “We’re gauging how different clips translate into what kind of pickup in viewership we get and what kind of buzz we’re getting on the blogs,” said Dennis Quinn, Turner Broadcasting’s executive vice president for business development. “If they’re watching a six-minute clip of ‘Robot Chicken,’ is that translating into a greater sampling of the network show? If we see older shows like ‘Harvey Birdman’ picking up again, what does that mean for people who produce the content?” At least one of Microsoft’s competitors is also preparing to enter this digital arena. Sony’s PlayStation 3, which comes with the ability to play high-definition Blu-ray DVDs, also allows gamers to connect to Sony’s own broadband network. Right now that network doesn’t offer much more than video-game demos and movie trailers, but that will soon change.  “As long as you’re downloading a trailer, what’s to stop us from offering the entire program, whether it’s a movie or a TV show?” said Peter Dille, the senior vice president for marketing for Sony Computer Entertainment America. “Being part of Sony Corporation, with a film entertainment company as a sister company and a music company at arm’s length, the world is our oyster in many respects.” For the moment Nintendo has no immediate plans to make film and television programming available for its Wii game console, which also lets gamers connect to an Internet-based network of content channels. But the company did not rule out the possibility.  “There’s a lot of plans we have for the channels,” said Perrin Kaplan, Nintendo’s vice president for marketing. “And there are ways that they could be used that we haven’t yet really conceived of.” Though Microsoft is the only gaming company to provide a substantial content library (roughly 100 movies and several hundred television episodes so far), some gamers feel the offerings are too limited to encourage them to use the feature regularly.  “Until you feel like it’s a pretty comprehensive list where you can look up just about anything, it’s not a service that I think most people will use,” said Dan Hsu, editor in chief of Electronic Gaming Monthly magazine. “You can just go, ‘Well, maybe I’ll check the iTunes music store or nbc.com and see if they have the shows that I want.’ ”  Other industry executives say the current push to provide entertainment content has more to do with satisfying console manufacturers’ needs than with fulfilling gamers’ demands.  “For this round of consoles it makes total sense that they have to focus on entertainment,” said Ricardo Sanchez, an executive at GameTap, a service that lets subscribers play console and arcade games on their personal computers. “For Sony I’ve got to believe the PS3 is as much about establishing Blu-ray as it is about selling games. On the Microsoft side they’re betting so much on Xbox Live that they’ll do practically anything to drive awareness and interest in it.”  At the same time, Mr. Sanchez said, “I don’t see them spending a lot of effort, beyond just aggregating content you can get elsewhere.”  Most gamers understand that in exchange for the ability to watch “South Park” reruns on demand, they are giving the console makers something: a valuable piece of real estate in their home-theater cabinets that a DVD player or stereo receiver might otherwise occupy. That bargain is especially precious for Microsoft, which is still better known as a monolithic software company than a trusted manufacturer of home electronics.  “This is following years of Bill Gates wanting to pursue something around a set-top box,” said Josh Larson, the director of the video-game Web site GameSpot.com. “It’s kind of a Trojan horse into the living room.” But as media ploys go, Mr. Larson would rather download his movies from Xbox Live than from PC-based services like Movielink or Amazon.com’s Unbox. “Is it more likely for a gamer that you’re going to download from iTunes and hook your PC up to your TV set?” he asked. “Or a couple button-pushes and you’re watching it in a way that you’re used to watching that content? I think that’s pretty powerful.” Despite the enduring perception that his company is seeking to conquer the universe, Mr. Moore said Microsoft was looking only to provide an audience of savvy, affluent media consumers with the kind of products they want in the way they’ve grown accustomed to consuming them. “In my case,” he said, “I very rarely watch live television anymore. Shows like ‘Lost,’ I’ll wait for the DVD, thank you, rather than have to see it chopped up into five-minute increments with four minutes of commercials. In today’s world we don’t have appointment viewing anymore.” More recently, Mr. Moore said, he was looking to catch up on some recent episodes of “CSI” — in high-definition, preferably — and sure enough, the only place he could find them was on Xbox Live. “I live in Seattle,” he explained, “and I have DirecTV. They don’t put the local networks on in high-def.”"

                "Owners of Microsoft's Xbox 360 game console will soon be able to watch science fiction epics as well as play them. Microsoft said last night that it would offer movies and episodes of television shows for downloading through its Xbox Live online service in the United States, starting Nov. 22. With the new offerings, Microsoft is joining cable giants and Internet start-ups on the long list of companies hoping to profit from video downloading. But Internet-based services have had trouble getting traction because it can be complex to send a downloaded film to a television screen and frustrating to watch it on the small screen of a computer. Owners of the Xbox have already connected it to a TV and, in most cases, the Internet. \"What makes this big is that there's no PC in the middle,\" said Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group. Microsoft has negotiated the rights to rent or sell more than 1,000 hours of material from CBS, MTV Networks, Paramount, Warner Brothers and Turner Broadcasting, along with the martial arts show \"Ultimate Fighting Championship.\" Some programs will be available in high-definition video. The video store will work much like that of Apple Computer, with some important differences. While users will be able to keep television shows, movies can be rented for only a limited period. The videos will not be playable on other devices and cannot be burned onto DVDs, but the online service will keep track of purchases so that users can log in to watch their videos on a friend's Xbox. Peter Moore, Microsoft's corporate vice president for interactive entertainment, said that the price of standard-definition videos would be comparable to what competitors charged. Apple's iTunes charges $1.99 for an episode of a television program. High-definition content will cost more, Mr. Moore said, because of the costs involved in storing it and making it available for downloading. Purchases will be made with points that users can buy with a credit card or a gift certificate, or win in contests. Mr. Moore said the service was partly intended to make the Xbox more versatile and therefore more attractive. \"Direct revenue from this over the long term could be important,\" Mr. Moore said. \"But this is also another reason to buy an Xbox 360.\" New game consoles from Sony and Nintendo are due out this month, a year after the Xbox 360 went on sale, so extra features could help Microsoft keep up in the marketplace. Nintendo is concentrating on game play, but Sony says it also has other content in mind. \"We haven't announced any content besides games,\" said Dave Karraker, a spokesman for Sony Computer Entertainment America, \"but all the executives have said that downloading other entertainment content is something the PlayStation 3 is capable of doing.\" Judging by the initial offerings, Xbox Live will be something of a cyberspace version of the Spike Channel, MTV Networks' cable channel aimed at young men. It will sell episodes of \"Star Trek,\" remastered in high definition, as well as the \"C.S.I.\" shows, some music videos and cartoons from the Cartoon Network's \"Adult Swim.\" \"The interesting thing is that we're delivering the 18-to-34-year-olds who aren't watching TV,\" Mr. Moore said. Microsoft has sold more than two million Xbox 360 consoles in the United States, according to the NPD Group, a market research firm. Most of those who buy the machines sign up for the Xbox Live service, which requires broadband Internet access and allows users to compete against each other. Since the introduction of the Xbox 360 last year, the service has also sold simple video games and other material. This year, Microsoft started to hint at its ambitions for the Xbox Live service when it purchased a company that places advertising in video games and made an ad deal with Cadillac. In the last few years, Microsoft has been pushing the idea of Media Center PCs, which are meant to sit in the living room and supply music and video to the stereo and the television set. But the concept has not caught on, in part because of the complexity of setting up and using these systems. Mr. Enderle said that apart from simplicity, another feature that would set the XBox Live service apart is that it will be the first service to sell downloadable movies in high definition, at a resolution similar to or better than a DVD. Until now, he said, most studios have been reluctant to allow cable channels to show movies in high definition for fear of piracy, but that would be less of a threat on XBox Live. Early next year, Apple plans to introduce a product that, on a preliminary basis, it is calling iTV and that is intended to be a bridge between the computer and the television set. But Microsoft will go into the video business with a different business model. Apple, most analysts maintain, does not make much money selling iTunes content, but makes up for that by selling more iPods, which are extremely profitable. Microsoft, which analysts say loses money on each Xbox 360 it sells, expects to make up for that by selling games -- and now video. \"This is a razors-and-blades business,\" Mr. Moore said. \"I've taken the hit on the razor. And the ability of Microsoft to offer more blades gives consumers more choice and drives more revenue.\" The video downloads, especially those in high definition, will take up a lot of space. Microsoft says a one-hour television program in high definition will take up about 2 gigabytes of the console's standard 20-gigabyte hard drive. Microsoft says the Xbox will play both movies and TV shows as they are being downloaded, although with larger files there will be a delay before playback starts, in contrast to the video-on-demand services offered by cable companies. High-definition movies will take an especially long while, depending on the speed of the Internet connection. Editors' Note: November 10, 2006, Friday An article in Business Day on Tuesday described a decision by Microsoft to offer movies and episodes of television shows for downloading through its Xbox Live online service in the United States. The article quoted Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group, discussing the features that set Xbox Live service apart and its position in the market. But the article did not note that Mr. Enderle had Microsoft as a client, a fact later pointed out by a reader. Mr. Enderle does consulting work for several of Microsoft's product groups, though not for the one developing the Xbox; still, had The Times known of Mr. Enderle's work for Microsoft, it would not have sought out his opinion on the product."

                "TOKYO — Microsoft is expected to slash the price of its Xbox 360 game console in Japan by about 30 percent, below the price of Nintendo's Wii and Sony's PlayStation 3 as it tries to increase its market share, a newspaper reported Monday. Demand for the Xbox 360 has been tepid in Japan, mainly due to a lack of popular games. In contrast, the market-leading Wii is thriving on a range of innovative software, prompting Nintendo to raise its earning forecast Friday. Hiroshi Kamide, a KBC Securities analyst, said a price cut alone is unlikely to trigger a jump in demand for the Xbox 360 and Microsoft needs to focus more on producing attractive software. \"Popular software is now serving as a tail wind to Xbox sales,\" he said. \"Even if they slash the console price, that would not directly boost sales unless they release more good software.\" Robust demand for Namco Bandai's \"Tales of Vesperia\" role-playing game helped Xbox 360's Japanese sales in the week ended Aug. 10. beat the PlayStation 3 for the first time. Microsoft will lower the price of the Xbox 360 Arcade model by ¥8,000 to ¥19,800, or about $180, the Nikkei business daily said. The Arcade does not come equipped with a hard drive and is the least expensive of the three Xbox 360 models. The company has already cut the price in the United States, Europe and four Asian markets as it tries to grab a larger chunk of the $57 billion game industry. The new price will make that model cheaper than Nintendo's Wii, which sells for about ¥25,000 yen, and the PlayStation 3, which sells for ¥39,800. The Wii's success has been attributed to inventive titles like the \"Wii Fit\" exercise game, its low price and its easy-to-learn motion-sensing controller. Microsoft will also reduce the price of two more expensive models with hard drives by ¥5,000 to ¥8,000, the paper said. Kazumi Ishiyama, a Microsoft Xbox spokeswoman in Japan, declined to comment on the Nikkei report. The company is scheduled to hold a briefing on the Xbox 360 in the Japanese market Monday afternoon. In Europe, the Xbox 360 Arcade model already costs less than the Wii. The Xbox 360 has lagged its Japanese rivals on their home turf, with 684,695 units sold so far in Japan against Wii's 6.67 million and PlayStation 3's 2.32 million, according to the game magazine publisher Enterbrain. The Xbox 360 was introduced about a year before its rivals."

                "AFTER a 31-year-old Manhattan financial executive received Microsoft's Xbox video game system as a gift in January, he walked to a store and bought a half-dozen game titles. The video game industry would have been pleased to hear it. After he played those games a few times against computer-controlled opponents, he got a bit bored and signed up for Microsoft's Xbox Live service, which enabled him to play against other people online. The video game industry, again, would have been pleased. After a few months on the Xbox Live network, in May, he got a bit bored again. This time, however, he opened his Xbox and soldered in a chip that allowed him to change the console's basic computer code and bypass its internal security technology. After installing a new hard drive, he transferred about 3,000 MP3 music files to the system and downloaded illegal copies of 3,500 old-time arcade games. Then he installed the Linux operating system, which allowed him to use the box essentially as a personal computer. Needless to say, the video game industry would not have been pleased. When Microsoft released the Xbox in November 2001, it was heralded as far more than a game machine. Even as the Xbox took aim at Sony's PlayStation 2 game empire, the console was meant to lead Microsoft's broader invasion of the living room. Incorporating a hard drive, which made it more readily adaptable than other consoles, the Xbox had the potential to be a digital-entertainment nerve center. Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, said at the time, ''We're going to put new software that runs on Xbox that, both in the gaming dimension and other dimensions, will amaze people with the power that's in this box.'' That is happening, but not necessarily as Microsoft planned. All sorts of new software is indeed running on Xbox consoles these days, and they are in fact becoming home-entertainment hubs, but it is not Microsoft doing the amazing. Rather, an online confederacy apparently numbering in the thousands -- including accomplished hackers of varied motives and everyday technophiles like the Manhattan financial executive (who shared his experience on the condition of anonymity) -- is taking the lead. Those involved often call their efforts ''unleashing'' or ''unshackling'' -- freeing the Xbox to express its inner PC. Technology industry executives, however, often call such activity a bald attempt to hijack the Xbox illegally. It is a battle that involves many of the ethical and legal issues facing the technology and media industries at this digital moment. What rights do consumers have to tinker with products they own? How far should companies go to protect their intellectual property? What happens when the desires of consumers conflict with the business models of companies they patronize? Who gets to decide just what a particular product may be used for? The Xbox is a particularly attractive target for hackers because while it is essentially a standard PC modified to do only a few things, like play Xbox games, it is much cheaper than a PC. It is like an economy car modified to follow only a few roads -- but one potentially as powerful as a far more expensive model. In the Xbox, that power comes in the form of a 733-megahertz Intel processor, comparable to a midrange personal computer, and sophisticated graphics and audio systems. Its limited operating system, based on a version of Windows, can be used by a programmer to run simple software like a music player -- or the machine can run a new operating system altogether, namely Linux. ''The reality is that if you could bypass Microsoft's operating system you would end up with a fairly powerful computer for less than $200,'' the Manhattan financial executive said. In fact, Microsoft lowered the price for Xbox to $179.99 in May. In a sense, Xbox hackers are exploiting Microsoft's business model, which is to sell Xbox hardware at a loss (to build penetration of the system) and make the money back on royalties from the sale of Xbox software. A PC manufacturer like Dell, meanwhile, has to recoup its costs and generate a profit from the initial sale. So someone who buys the Xbox hardware, modifies it into a general-purpose computer and does not buy Xbox games potentially undermines not only Microsoft but also the personal computer industry. But that is not how some Xbox hackers think about it. ''Especially in Europe, computers are more expensive than they are here, and the Xbox is the cheapest computer you can get,'' Andrew Huang, author of a new book called ''Hacking the Xbox: An Introduction to Reverse Engineering,'' said in a telephone interview. ''Basically,'' he added by e-mail, ''once you have Linux, you have everything.'' It is unclear just how many Xbox hackers there are. Officials of the Interactive Digital Software Association, a trade group of video game publishers, said that Xbox hacking appeared more prevalent in parts of Asia than in North America. Michael Steil, a 24-year-old German who is project leader of a group that calls itself the Xbox Linux Project, said by e-mail that a full version of Linux software for the Xbox had been downloaded more than 220,000 times. Whatever the numbers, Microsoft does not appear eager to discuss Xbox hacking. In recent weeks, a Microsoft public relations representative repeatedly declined to make any company executives available to discuss the matter. Instead, the company issued a statement through a public relations firm that said in part: ''Microsoft is a company passionate about innovation and creativity. We are also very committed to respect for others' intellectual property and we request the same respect applied to our innovations.'' The statement made no reference to the potential use of hacked Xbox consoles as personal computers, saying Microsoft's ''primary concern'' was with the sale of modified chips for the boxes ''that enable game counterfeiting.'' And that is the area that most clearly raises legal issues. Although there are several methods, hacking an Xbox typically involves obtaining a special chip called a modchip, available on the Internet, and soldering it into the machine. (For those who find the process daunting, there are also vendors on the Internet who sell ''pre-modded'' Xbox units.) Modchips, of which there are several varieties, allow users to load new versions of the basic computer code, known as the BIOS, that tells the machine how to operate. A hacked BIOS generally incorporates modified versions of copyrighted Microsoft code and so is generally illegal. The main Web sites that deal with Xbox hacking do not include links to hacked BIOS, and hackers generally find their forbidden fruit in Internet chat rooms. Once the modchip is installed and the BIOS modified, the console can do a number of things it cannot do ''out of the box.'' Xbox games normally must be run from an optical disk, and a hacked Xbox can ''back up'' a game to the unit's hard drive and run the game without the disk. This technique could be used simply to avoid having to insert and remove disks -- or it could be used for piracy (say, by renting a game, putting the software on the hard drive and returning the game). Until passage of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act in 1998, the mere sale of a modified chip would not have appeared illegal. That law, however, prohibits the sale of devices that are primarily meant to circumvent copyright protection. Companies and technologists will fight over the exact legal meaning of those provisions for years. For now, however, the software industry is relying on them. ''Our view over all on modchips is that they are illegal infringing devices, that where we find people engaged in the widespread manufacturing and distribution of them, we and our members, individually and collectively, are committed to doing what we can to shut down their manufacturing and go after the distributors,'' said Doug Lowenstein, president of the Interactive Digital Software Association. Some advocates, however, say that while software piracy is illegal and morally offensive, the mere act of modifying hardware should not be illegal. ''The most important dimension of this debate from our view is that people should have the right to tinker with the stuff that they own,'' said Fred von Lohmann, senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a civil-liberties group in San Francisco. ''Others will say that this is about piracy and all that, but they forget that the principle of tinkering with the stuff that you own was the principle on which the entire personal computer industry was founded,'' he added. ''This is basic business and basic science in the technology world and we think that this right to tinker, this freedom to tinker, remains legally protected.'' For now, however, the federal government seems to agree with Mr. Lowenstein. Last December, David M. Rocci, a 22-year-old from Blacksburg, Va., pleaded guilty to a federal charge of conspiring to import, market and sell modchips for the Xbox. In April, he was sentenced to five months in prison and five months of home detention. Simply from the standpoint of accessibility, the PlayStation 2 would seem to be a more likely candidate for hacking. IDG, the technology research firm, estimates that at the end of last year, 38.1 million PlayStation 2 units were in use in Europe, North America and Japan combined, compared with 6.7 million Xbox units in those regions. In one sense, however, the hacking scene for PlayStation 2 is less developed than the one for Xbox because there is less appetite for it. Sony sells an official conversion kit for the PlayStation 2 that includes a hard drive and allows that system to run the Linux operating system, which in turn allows the system to run MP3's, movies, spreadsheets or any other program or data that works under Linux. It is relatively easy for Sony to embrace Linux because Sony, unlike Microsoft, is not in the operating system business. The PlayStation 2 hacking community seems focused on developing chips that allow PlayStation 2 units to run illegal copies of games and games meant for far-flung parts of the world. (For marketing reasons, many PlayStation 2 games include regional coding, much as DVD's do.) In 2001, Sony sued an Australian for selling modchips that allowed Australian PlayStation 2 units to play games from other parts of the world. After the Australian government argued on the man's behalf, however, the Federal Court of Australia last July ruled mostly against Sony. Mr. von Lohmann said that Microsoft had not been particularly aggressive in combating Xbox hackers but that Sony had actively fought them. A Sony spokeswoman did not respond this week to requests for comment about the company's approach to hackers. For its part, Microsoft, through its public relations agency, indicated that it believed Xbox hackers were a relatively small band. ''Aside from a set of hobbyists,'' it said, ''the vast majority of Xbox owners are not focused on this niche.'' But those who are appear quite focused indeed. By e-mail, Mr. Steil, the German leader of the Xbox Linux project, declared: ''In very simple words: The Xbox is cheaper than a PC. The Xbox is a lot smaller than a PC. The Xbox looks better (next to a TV set). The Xbox is more silent. Therefore it's an ideal Linux computer in the living room.'' That was probably not the vision Mr. Gates had in mind."

                "Users of Microsoft’s popular Xbox Kinect gaming console will soon be able to use voice and motion commands to interact with advertisements while they are playing their favorite game or watching a video. On Tuesday, Microsoft is set to announce a new suite of advertising tools, called NUads, short for natural user-interface ads, that will let users interact with advertising on the console dashboard or embedded in games and other video content. The ads use the same voice and motion control developed for the company’s Kinect game console, which it introduced in time for the 2010 holiday season.  The new ads are intended to help advertisers keep the attention of Xbox users in a way that traditional television advertising does not.  “When you have highly interactive people and a passive medium, they are interacting with their phone or their laptop while watching TV,” said Mark Kroese, the general manager of the advertising business group at Microsoft. The new ads, Mr. Kroese said, “create a natural way for the user to engage with the TV.”  At least one advertising agency seems to agree.  “The new ad units really epitomized the level of engagement that everyone is working towards,” said John M. Lisko, the executive communications director of Saatchi & Saatchi Los Angeles, part of the Publicis Groupe. Mr. Lisko said the agency had successfully advertised on the Xbox console in the past and was “absolutely considering” the new capabilities. “You can text, you can tweet, you can vote,” he said. “That’s phenomenal.”  Using voice commands, gamers will be able to send messages about an ad to a social networking site like Twitter by saying “Xbox Tweet.” Advertisers who want to send more information about a product or promotion associated with a campaign can prompt Xbox users to say “Xbox More,” which will send users an e-mail with the information they wanted.  For advertising tied to events like television shows, advertisers can prompt a user to say “Xbox Schedule” and the system will send a text message reminder to the user’s mobile phone. Similarly, advertisers can prompt users to say “Xbox Near Me” and a map to the nearest retailer will be sent to their mobile phone. Finally, advertisers can prompt users to vote on a topic by asking the user to wave their hand in front of the console and select their favorite pizza topping, superhero or clothing brand.  The new advertising options will be presented on Tuesday to advertisers at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, an annual conference for advertisers and marketers. Consumers will begin to see the new features in the spring of 2012.  The new ads will be simple for marketers to deploy since they can use the same commercials they would use on television.  “What we’re seeing now is a technology environment where marketers can deliver more sophisticated ads and they don’t have some of the hurdles that in-game marketers and in-game publishers had,” said Paul Verna, a senior analyst at eMarketer. “It’s a level of interactivity that suggests more possibilities than we’ve seen up until now.” "

                "The daughter of a Brazilian Catholic mother and a Palestinian Muslim father, Fatima Shama, 39, grew up in the Bronx, attending Roman Catholic school during the week, Muslim “Sunday school” on Saturdays and church on Sundays. She speaks six languages, which comes in handy for her job as the commissioner of the Mayor’s Office of Immigrant Affairs, a position she has held since 2009. (Recently, her office reached out to immigrant communities affected by Hurricane Sandy to help them navigate government resources and aid.) She lives in Turtle Bay in Manhattan with her husband, Ziad Mansouri, 42, who works at JPMorgan Chase, and their three sons, Samir, 8; Ibrahim, 5; and Omar, 2. She and her husband are raising them as Muslims, with a generous dose of other religious traditions. WAKE-UP CALL My kids tend to wake me up — that’s about 6:30, 7 o’clock. Coffee is absolutely essential. It’s almost the first thing I do. Then we get the Sunday Times. My youngest son loves to be the person to get it for me. INTERNATIONAL BREAKFAST It could be me deciding to make Belgian waffles or pancakes, or it’s possible I’ll make — my kids love an Arabic breakfast food called lebni — basically, strained yogurt, and you eat it with pita bread. And they love an Arabic string cheese and another kind of cheese common to the region called haloumi, a must to every breakfast table in our house OUTSIDE VOICES Sundays are absolutely about family and spending time with our kids. From 11 to 2 is our outside time. We might go ice skating at Wollman Rink, or the Central Park Zoo; we are there a lot and we love it. I think that the kids would probably say the Museum of Natural History is their favorite, just ‘cause of what we get to see. It’s everything from butterflies and frogs and lizards to the dinosaurs or the elephants. And they can be loud and we don’t have to apologize to anybody. Sometimes we’ll do excursions out of the city, or there might be a children’s birthday party or two, given our kids’ social lives. PARADER IN CHIEF If it’s summertime, there’s likely a parade that I might march in or a community event I might stop by. Of course, during the hurricane, every Sunday we were out in the community. But if it’s summertime, rest assured there’s a parade in my future. BOYS’ TIME Our kids are only allowed to play their electronics on the weekends. Our kids got an Xbox for Christmas — I grew up in a dual home, so my kids have the pleasure of learning about their own faith, but also being able to celebrate the faith of my siblings and mother. The Xbox Kinect Dance Central game, I will tell you that is hysterical. I actually love the fact that this Kinect thing helps them jump around. And Sunday football is a big deal. We’re a Giants home, but my sons love the Tampa Bay Buccaneers — their mascot is a pirate, so we think that’s how it started. My oldest son can tell you anything about football. SHOPPING, COOKING I try to cook for the week or make some Sunday dinner for us, so I might run to the supermarket. I love to cook with my kids. My middle son loves to make a Brazilian cheese bread, so we make that a lot. We make black beans and rice, there’s always a pasta night — I do make, actually, a lot of Arabic food. WINDING DOWN Then it’s dinner, bath time and we do reading every night. Our kids are in bed by about 8:30. And it’s my date with “Downton Abbey.” Lady Grantham, the grandmother, I just love her absolutely dry sarcasm and her love of the monarchy and all things traditional. And I try to clean out my e-mail before Monday morning, do what I can do to make life better before Monday morning. FINISHING UP This is actually a very true thing: I basically don’t go to sleep until I finish the paper so I can put it out into the recycling bin. Otherwise it becomes a pile. I actually try to finish all of my Sunday paper and I actually read the paper — Sunday in particular — minus a couple sections, cover to cover. I love holding the paper, but I love the ads. I like to look at the jewelry ads. Even though I could never buy any of it."

                "NEW YORK — Reaching out to millions of aspiring game developers around the world, Microsoft is holding a contest that will award $10,000 and the opportunity to entice millions of viewers to the next great digital diversion for the company's Xbox 360. In addition to the game console's snazzy graphics, the Xbox Live online service has been the most important component of the Xbox 360's success since its debut in 2005. And perhaps the most popular aspect of Xbox Live has been the service's arcade component, which allows users to download and play smaller, relatively simple games like \"Uno\" and \"Geometry Wars\" that usually cost less than $10. (By contrast, top-end games can sell in stores for around $60.) The popularity of Xbox Live Arcade has in turn attracted the attention of game developers looking to create the next \"Tetris\" or \"Minesweeper.\" Late last year, Microsoft introduced a suite of software tools for making so- called casual games called XNA. So at a convention of game makers Monday in San Francisco, Microsoft was to announce a contest that will award a cash prize and a potential slot on Xbox Live Arcade to the best game created with XNA tools. The company intends to announce the winner of the \"Dream-Build-Play\" contest in August. \"This competition highlights the power of XNA and the popularity of the Xbox Live Arcade service, with its millions of users,\" Aaron Greenberg, Microsoft's group product manager for the Xbox 360 and Xbox Live, said by phone. To help increase the popularity of casual games, Microsoft is also introducing a 512-megabyte portable storage device for the Xbox 360. The previous portable storage unit contained only 64 megabytes of data, and so Xbox Live Arcade games had been limited to an official size of 50 megabytes. With the new unit, Microsoft will also raise the official size limit on Xbox Live Arcade games to 150 megabytes, allowing enhanced graphics, sound and artificial intelligence."

                "Users of Microsoft’s popular Xbox Kinect gaming console will soon be able to use voice and motion commands to interact with advertisements while they are playing their favorite game or watching a video. On Tuesday, Microsoft is set to announce a new suite of advertising tools, called NUads, short for natural user-interface ads, that will let users interact with advertising on the console dashboard or embedded in games and other video content. The ads use the same voice and motion control developed for the company’s Kinect game console, which it introduced in time for the 2010 holiday season.  The new ads are intended to help advertisers keep the attention of Xbox users in a way that traditional television advertising does not.  “When you have highly interactive people and a passive medium, they are interacting with their phone or their laptop while watching TV,” said Mark Kroese, the general manager of the advertising business group at Microsoft. The new ads, Mr. Kroese said, “create a natural way for the user to engage with the TV.”  At least one advertising agency seems to agree.  “The new ad units really epitomized the level of engagement that everyone is working towards,” said John M. Lisko, the executive communications director of Saatchi & Saatchi Los Angeles, part of the Publicis Groupe. Mr. Lisko said the agency had successfully advertised on the Xbox console in the past and was “absolutely considering” the new capabilities. “You can text, you can tweet, you can vote,” he said. “That’s phenomenal.”  Using voice commands, gamers will be able to send messages about an ad to a social networking site like Twitter by saying “Xbox Tweet.” Advertisers who want to send more information about a product or promotion associated with a campaign can prompt Xbox users to say “Xbox More,” which will send users an e-mail with the information they wanted.  For advertising tied to events like television shows, advertisers can prompt a user to say “Xbox Schedule” and the system will send a text message reminder to the user’s mobile phone. Similarly, advertisers can prompt users to say “Xbox Near Me” and a map to the nearest retailer will be sent to their mobile phone. Finally, advertisers can prompt users to vote on a topic by asking the user to wave their hand in front of the console and select their favorite pizza topping, superhero or clothing brand.  The new advertising options will be presented on Tuesday to advertisers at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, an annual conference for advertisers and marketers. Consumers will begin to see the new features in the spring of 2012.  The new ads will be simple for marketers to deploy since they can use the same commercials they would use on television.  “What we’re seeing now is a technology environment where marketers can deliver more sophisticated ads and they don’t have some of the hurdles that in-game marketers and in-game publishers had,” said Paul Verna, a senior analyst at eMarketer. “It’s a level of interactivity that suggests more possibilities than we’ve seen up until now.” "

                "LOS ANGELES — In what may be one of the costliest consumer warranty repairs in history, Microsoft announced on Thursday that it would spend up to $1.15 billion to repair failing Xbox 360 game machine consoles. While the company would not say how many units were failing, Robbie Bach, president of Microsoft's entertainment and devices division, said that there have been an \"unacceptable high number of repairs.\" The majority of Xbox 360 owners, he said, have not experienced hardware failure. Company officials said that Microsoft had sold 11.6 million Xbox 360 units by the end of June, shy of the 12 million units the company had predicted. The Xbox 360, which first went of sale in November 2005, is currently the best-selling game machine in the United States, according to NPD, a market research firm. The size of the anticipated repair bill suggests that a third to as many as half of the machines are flawed. Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington State, said it would take a charge of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion against earnings in the quarter ended June 30. Consumers know they have a problem if three red flashing lights appear on the console. Gamers on online forums have been referring to the event as \"the Red Ring of Death\" because the machine then shuts down. The company declined to explain the nature of the failure, but said that it was not caused by a single problem in the console, which it said contained 1,700 components and 500 million transistors. The company also said there were no health or safety concerns involved. The problem began to appear over the last three to four months, Bach said, after \"significant usage\" of the consoles. He said the company has taken steps to correct the problem in new devices. Microsoft said it would extend the warranty of the game console to three years to customers worldwide. Previously, products sold in the United States were covered by a one-year warranty, while Xbox 360 units sold in Europe had a two-year warranty. In addition, customers who have had their consoles repaired because of the \"three flashing lights\" problem will be reimbursed for the cost of the repairs. Microsoft has succeeded in establishing the Xbox brand against the better known Sony PlayStation and other game machines. The Xbox and its successor, the Xbox 360, was the software maker's first major foray into hardware. Although sales are small relative to the rest of Microsoft's revenue, the Xbox has been an important venture for the company and was viewed by many analysts as Microsoft's attempt to compete with the likes of Sony and Apple for control of electronics and entertainment within homes. The device can be used to access the Internet and view movies. Microsoft said its entertainment and devices division reported an operating loss of $315 million on $929 million in revenue for the three-month period that ended in March, and analysts have estimated that the company lost about $6 billion getting a foothold in the game machine industry. A new Xbox 360 with a 20-gigabyte hard drive sells for about $400, but other versions cost about $300. The announcement comes on the eve of the E3 Media and Business Summit, the video-game industry's major trade show, to be held next week in Los Angeles. \"This is bound to affect discussions between Microsoft and its developers and retailers,\" said Richard Doherty, a partner in the research company Envisioneering Group."

                "Editors’ Note Appended Owners of Microsoft’s Xbox 360 game console will soon be able to watch science fiction epics as well as play them.  Microsoft said last night that it would offer movies and episodes of television shows for downloading through its Xbox Live online service in the United States, starting Nov. 22.  With the new offerings, Microsoft is joining cable giants and Internet start-ups on the long list of companies hoping to profit from video downloading. But Internet-based services have had trouble getting traction because it can be complex to send a downloaded film to a television screen and frustrating to watch it on the small screen of a computer. Owners of the Xbox have already connected it to a TV and, in most cases, the Internet. “What makes this big is that there’s no PC in the middle,” said Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group. Microsoft has negotiated the rights to rent or sell more than 1,000 hours of material from CBS, MTV Networks, Paramount, Warner Brothers and Turner Broadcasting, along with the martial arts show “Ultimate Fighting Championship.” Some programs will be available in high-definition video. The video store will work much like that of Apple Computer, with some important differences. While users will be able to keep television shows, movies can be rented for only a limited period. The videos will not be playable on other devices and cannot be burned onto DVDs, but the online service will keep track of purchases so that users can log in to watch their videos on a friend’s Xbox.  Peter Moore, Microsoft’s corporate vice president for interactive entertainment, said that the price of standard-definition videos would be comparable to what competitors charged. Apple’s iTunes charges $1.99 for an episode of a television program.  High-definition content will cost more, Mr. Moore said, because of the costs involved in storing it and making it available for downloading. Purchases will be made with points that users can buy with a credit card or a gift certificate, or win in contests.  Mr. Moore said the service was partly intended to make the Xbox more versatile and therefore more attractive. “Direct revenue from this over the long term could be important,” Mr. Moore said. “But this is also another reason to buy an Xbox 360.”  New game consoles from Sony and Nintendo are due out this month, a year after the Xbox 360 went on sale, so extra features could help Microsoft keep up in the marketplace. Nintendo is concentrating on game play, but Sony says it also has other content in mind.  “We haven’t announced any content besides games,” said Dave Karraker, a spokesman for Sony Computer Entertainment America, “but all the executives have said that downloading other entertainment content is something the PlayStation 3 is capable of doing.” Judging by the initial offerings, Xbox Live will be something of a cyberspace version of the Spike Channel, MTV Networks’ cable channel aimed at young men. It will sell episodes of “Star Trek,” remastered in high definition, as well as the “C.S.I.” shows, some music videos and cartoons from the Cartoon Network’s “Adult Swim.”  “The interesting thing is that we’re delivering the 18-to-34-year-olds who aren’t watching TV,” Mr. Moore said. Microsoft has sold more than two million Xbox 360 consoles in the United States, according to the NPD Group, a market research firm. Most of those who buy the machines sign up for the Xbox Live service, which requires broadband Internet access and allows users to compete against each other.  Since the introduction of the Xbox 360 last year, the service has also sold simple video games and other material. This year, Microsoft started to hint at its ambitions for the Xbox Live service when it purchased a company that places advertising in video games and made an ad deal with Cadillac.  In the last few years, Microsoft has been pushing the idea of Media Center PCs, which are meant to sit in the living room and supply music and video to the stereo and the television set. But the concept has not caught on, in part because of the complexity of setting up and using these systems.  Mr. Enderle said that apart from simplicity, another feature that would set the XBox Live service apart is that it will be the first service to sell downloadable movies in high definition, at a resolution similar to or better than a DVD.  Until now, he said, most studios have been reluctant to allow cable channels to show movies in high definition for fear of piracy, but that would be less of a threat on XBox Live.  Early next year, Apple plans to introduce a product that, on a preliminary basis, it is calling iTV and that is intended to be a bridge between the computer and the television set. But Microsoft will go into the video business with a different business model. Apple, most analysts maintain, does not make much money selling iTunes content, but makes up for that by selling more iPods, which are extremely profitable. Microsoft, which analysts say loses money on each Xbox 360 it sells, expects to make up for that by selling games — and now video.  “This is a razors-and-blades business,” Mr. Moore said. “I’ve taken the hit on the razor. And the ability of Microsoft to offer more blades gives consumers more choice and drives more revenue.”  The video downloads, especially those in high definition, will take up a lot of space. Microsoft says a one-hour television program in high definition will take up about 2 gigabytes of the console’s standard 20-gigabyte hard drive. Microsoft says the Xbox will play both movies and TV shows as they are being downloaded, although with larger files there will be a delay before playback starts, in contrast to the video-on-demand services offered by cable companies. High-definition movies will take an especially long while, depending on the speed of the Internet connection. "

                "It was nearly a decade ago that a young Microsoft programmer named J. Allard sounded the alarm and convinced Bill Gates that the Internet was a threat to the dominance of the Microsoft Windows operating system. On Monday, Microsoft will announce Mr. Allard's next big gamble: an ambitious billion-dollar-plus investment in an online game service to be called Xbox Live. Microsoft hopes to create what it describes as the equivalent of an online Disneyland, globally accessible over the Internet, where gamers who subscribe can find partners for dozens of different adventure, racing and sports games. The company is betting the service will save its Xbox video-game system, which began shipping last November but still lags far behind the industry-leading Sony PlayStation 2, which has nearly 30 million units in use worldwide, compared with only 3.5 million for the Xbox. (There are an estimated four million to five million Nintendo GameCube consoles now in use.) While Sony and Nintendo have online plans, networked game playing is peripheral to their video-game strategies. For Microsoft, it has been integral to the Xbox plan from the beginning -- the wedge with which Microsoft hopes to gain entry to the nation's and world's living rooms and become an entertainment powerhouse. It is a bet as ambitious as it is expensive. When Microsoft opens the electronic doors for its service this summer, the Internet technology in its three data centers in London, Seattle and Tokyo will have more capacity than its own Microsoft.com, which itself is one of the world's largest Web sites. The risk is that Microsoft is entering a quagmire that will soak up vast amounts of investment and lock the company in a bitter, potentially unwinnable battle with Sony and Nintendo, which will each be describing their own online services at this week's game industry convention, the Electronic Entertainment Expo, which starts Wednesday in Los Angeles. For Xbox Live to become a success the company acknowledges that it will have to attract millions of customers willing to pay $50 or more for each game's software and perhaps a $9.95 monthly subscription, in addition to the $40 to $60 a month for the high-speed Internet connection the service will require. Those are big if's, because while video games have become a wildly popular form of home entertainment, online game playing -- so far mainly employing personal computers, not game consoles -- has never appealed to more than a fraction of Internet users, and in almost all cases, only when it is free. Even more daunting is the fact that there is little evidence that video games have expanded much beyond their core audience of adolescent and college-age males. ''Gaming is a very age-specific and demographic-specific device and experience,'' said Mitchell Kertzmann, the chief executive office of Liberate Technologies, an interactive television equipment supplier based in San Carlos, Calif. There have already been well-publicized failures in the online gaming business. During the Internet bubble, start-ups like Total Entertainment Network and MPATH rose and fell on the promise of offering Web game portals for paying PC customers. And Sega, the one video-game company that did start an online service, Sega.net, way back in 2000, has dropped that service and no longer even makes game consoles, now focusing instead on software. ''It only works when you get to significantly high numbers of subscribers,'' said Lawrence Probst, chairman and chief executive officer of Electronic Arts, the largest maker of computer and video-game software. ''We've learned that the hard way with EA.com,'' he said, referring to the company's online computer-game service, whose only profitable component is the medieval-themed Ultima Online, which has about 200,000 subscribers. Another challenge may arise in household geography. In most homes, the video-game console is located in the living room, where the television set is -- nowhere near the high-speed Internet connection in the den. That assumes, of course that the den has a high-speed connection. Microsoft asserts that as many as half of its Xbox customers already have high-speed, or broadband, Internet connections. But so far only 12 percent of the nation's households have broadband Internet, according to Odyssey, a market research firm in San Francisco, and the number is growing only slowly. ''If this service requires broadband, just put it in the icebox for awhile,'' said Nick Donatiello, Odyssey's president. And yet Microsoft's new service does have its defenders, industry executives who think that online gaming can reach a broader audience than stand-alone video games have. ''Microsoft has the resources to make online gaming successful,'' said Charles Bellfield, the vice president for corporate strategy at Sega, which develops games for the Xbox and will offer versions for Xbox Live. ''It may not happen on day one, but by the time gaming reaches the mainstream, it will be doing well.'' Mr. Allard, who is now general manager of Microsoft's Xbox division, argues that Microsoft can create a mass audience by the force of a huge effort and by the company's ability to tap into a latent demand that he said he first detected three years ago. In an interview last week, Mr. Allard recalled the epiphany. While visiting a Seattle video-game arcade with other Xbox designers in 1999 he realized that the longest lines were all formed around the multiplayer games -- the basketball, car racing, tank warfare and other competitions in which players compete on individual or clustered machines. He said he came to believe that it would be the ''social'' experience offered by the Internet that would drive the next major generation of video games. That is why he committed the company to add the $40 to $50 worth of hardware to each Xbox needed to make every console Internet ready. Now Microsoft is ready to tap that built-in capability. On Monday, the company plans to announce that it will begin consumer tests of Xbox Live this summer with a one-year subscription and a headset, for $49, that will enable Xbox owners with high-speed Internet connections to compete and converse with one another online. Despite speculation that the company might use its online network connection to link Xbox users to Microsoft's other services, Mr. Allard insists that Xbox Live will stay focused on gaming. Robert J. Bach, a Microsoft senior vice president in charge of its games division said the company was planning a service that he compared to Disneyland for its safe, wholesome environment -- in contrast to the ''Coney Island'' he said that the open Internet can sometimes become. ''Compare Coney Island to Disneyland,'' he said. ''When you're at Disneyland, there's no trash, no violence and you never see security. That's what we have in mind.'' Mr. Allard invoked to the same metaphor to criticize his biggest competitor's approach. ''I won't deny that I've occasionally referred to Sony's online service as Sony Island,'' Mr. Allard said. Sony, which has said that it will begin selling a $40 adaptor for connecting the PlayStation 2 to the Internet either via dial-up modem or high-speed connection in August, makes no apologies for its approach. Although the company will not attempt to match Microsoft's ambitious online theme-park environment, neither will Sony attempt to charge users for playing its video games online -- at least not initially. If the gaming experiences are comparable for players, a free service based on Sony's market-dominating video-game console could prove an insurmountable rival to Microsoft's fee-based ''walled garden'' approach. Moreover, unlike Microsoft's command-and-control approach to the Xbox Live network, the Sony service will not force independent game publishers to provide their online PlayStation games through Sony's own network. That difference was highlighted when executives at Electronic Arts said last week that they planned an online alliance with Sony but remained unsure whether to get involved with Microsoft's XBox Live. Electronic Arts said it worried it might risk losing its customers to competing Microsoft games. Sony executives, meanwhile, questioned whether Xbox Live could ever justify itself financially. ''If I were Microsoft, I would spend my money first on selling units rather than building an online service,'' said Kazuo Hirai, the president and chief operating officer of Sony Computer Entertainment America. None of this deters Mr. Allard. Just as 3D graphics propelled growth in the last generation of video games, he said, Microsoft's ability to create a social experience will drive the next generation of gaming. ''The pendulum has swung too far in the single-user direction,'' he said. A critical component of the social experience planned for Xbox Live will be the audio headset, enabling players to cheer and jeer one another. The technology includes a ''voice masking'' feature that will conceal the identities and even ages of the contestants -- a Disneyland safeguard meant to deter adult exploitation of children online. Some analysts agree with Microsoft that voice capabilities could take video gaming to the next level. ''You're looking at a service that will become a new phone network overnight,'' said Richard Doherty, president of Envisioneering, a research and consulting firm in Seaford, N.Y. ''By Christmas, Microsoft could become the nation's fourth-largest phone company.''"

                "LOS ANGELES  Microsoft, seeking to expand offerings on its Xbox 360 console, has reached an agreement with a company headed by Peter Safran, the veteran Hollywood producer and talent manager, to produce original shows for distribution on the system. Through his Safran Company, Mr. Safran represents clients like the actor and producer Sean Combs (“Monster’s Ball”), the actor and writer Nia Vardalos (“My Big Fat Greek Wedding”) and the filmmakers Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer (“Epic Movie”). Mr. Safran founded the company in 2006 after leaving Brillstein-Grey Management. Speaking by telephone last week, Scott Nocas, global marketing manager for programming of the Xbox Live entertainment service, said he expected similar deals to follow. “We definitely look at this as the first of many,” said Mr. Nocas. In an interview at his office in Los Angeles last week, Mr. Safran said his first round of programs would all be scripted, as opposed to reality shows, and would probably run under 10 minutes. He said he planned initially to focus on genres, like comedy and horror, that appeal to the Xbox 360 audience, which is heavily concentrated from the ages of 14 to 34, and tends to be more male than female. The first shows are expected to be available to viewers by the fall. Microsoft’s previous forays in digital entertainment include a two-year-old initiative, MSN Originals, to provide original shows for the Web, and an ill-fated foray more than 10 years ago in which it poured about $100 million into Internet shows like the comedy “475 Madison,” about an advertising agency, then quickly canceled most of them. “The Xbox is unique. It operates at a level outside of what we generally consider Web entertainment,” Mr. Safran said, referring to the system’s tight demographic base, which is defined by the appeal of signature games like the Halo series.  The new shows will be available exclusively via the Xbox 360 for a time, then may appear elsewhere, Mr. Safran said. Mr. Nocas said at least some of the shows would be supported by advertising. Current programming on the Xbox 360 includes movies and selections from cable networks like the Sundance Channel and Spike TV. Viewers pay for access to films with points that can be purchased for cash or accumulated through activities on the system. Mr. Nocas said that about 10 million people had signed up for the Xbox Live service. Roughly 18 million of the game systems have been sold worldwide, he said. The Xbox 360 is up against PlayStation 3 from Sony and the Wii from Nintendo in a hotly competitive gaming marketplace. Mr. Safran is the latest in a growing line of Hollywood players who are seeking to tap into the digital entertainment market, where revenue still falls far short of that from traditional movie and television distribution outlets. Filmmakers like Joel and Ethan Coen and stars like Will Ferrell have recently become involved with Web-based companies like FunnyOrDie.com or 60Frames Entertainment. Mr. Safran and Jake Zim, chief operating officer of the Safran Company’s Safran Digital Group, said they expected to recruit established filmmakers for their new productions, but did not plan to seek involvement by major movie stars."

                "LOS ANGELES — Underscoring the importance Microsoft attaches to its video game efforts, Bill Gates has laid out a vision of a future in which gamers using the Xbox 360 console can be connected to others on a personal computer or a cellphone. The capabilities, part of an initiative called Live Anywhere, will be incorporated into the Windows Vista operating system when it goes on sale next year, he said Tuesday. \"The future is making gaming attractive to people of every age,\" he said. For Gates, Microsoft's chairman, it was the first appearance ever in connection with the Electronic Entertainment Expo, the huge annual video game trade show known as E3, which was to open on Wednesday in Los Angeles. His presence underscored the stakes in Microsoft's push to outflank the other two console makers, Sony and Nintendo. Microsoft has a head start. It introduced Xbox 360 last November, and after some initial supply constraints, 5 million to 5.5 million consoles will have been sold by the end of next month, said Peter Moore, a Microsoft vice president for interactive entertainment. He predicted sales of 10 million units by this fall, when Sony will release the PlayStation 3 and Nintendo the Wii (pronounced \"we\"). By this holiday season, Microsoft said, 160 games will be available for Xbox 360, including \"Grand Theft Auto IV,\" \"Splinter Cell: Double Agent\" and \"Forza Motorsport 2,\" for which Microsoft will sell a wireless steering wheel and headset. In addition, an external module for the Xbox 360 to play high-definition DVDs will be available by the holidays. While the PlayStation 3 will incorporate a drive for movies and games in Blu-ray, Sony's high-definition format, the Microsoft device will be used solely to play movies in a competing format, HD-DVD. With Microsoft's Live Anywhere system, game developers will be able to incorporate features that allow users to send instant messages between devices, and see if their friends are listening to music on their mobile phone or working on a PC. On certain games, players will be able to begin play on the Xbox 360, then switch to a mobile phone; they could also challenge others remotely regardless of whether they were using a PC or an Xbox 360. Sony got the week's events off to a start on Monday by announcing that the PlayStation 3 would be priced higher than expected, with versions selling for $499 and $599 - compared with $299 and $399 for the Xbox 360. At a Nintendo press event on Tuesday, there were no details about the pricing of its own new console beyond a promise from Reggie Fils-Aime, Nintendo of America's executive vice president of sales and marketing, that \"we will give you more fun for less money.\" In addition to new versions of its Zelda and Super Mario games, Nintendo also showed Wii Sports, which includes tennis, golf and Ping-Pong games designed to take advantage of the console's controller, which allows gamers to alter the action by waving it in space much like a club or baseball bat. Sony said Monday that it was incorporating motion sensors into the PlayStation 3 controller as well, but Microsoft said it was not worried by that move."

                "AS Microsoft enters the video game market with the release of its Xbox console on Thursday, some investors are placing their bets on allied companies like Flextronics, which is manufacturing the Xbox console, and Nvidia, which provides the graphics chip for the unit. To meet sales estimates of 1 million to 1.5 million game players before the end of the year, Microsoft is moving well beyond its normal marketing channels. The Xbox release includes cross-promotions with partners like Taco Bell and MTV. But even if sales reach that goal, Xbox will not ''move the needle a whole lot'' in terms of revenues for a company as big as Microsoft, said Jeff Bernstein, a portfolio manager with ING Pilgrim funds in New York. Microsoft is selling the Xbox for less than it costs to maked in the hope of eventually profiting on software development and licensing, several analysts said. But Xbox has already moved the needle on shares of Nvidia, a chip maker with a market capitalization of $7 billion. Its stock price has risen 90 percent since the beginning of 2001. It closed on Friday at $53.20. The company, based in Santa Clara, Calif., said earnings for the quarter ended Oct. 31 rose to $44.7 million, up from $28.1 million for the same period a year earlier. The company said it shipped $57.4 million worth of Xbox chips in the quarter, which counted against a $200 million advance Microsoft gave the company for initial Xbox production. ''There's a nice ramp of revenues coming from the Xbox,'' Mr. Bernstein said. Xbox revenues are expected to account for more than 10 percent of the company's revenues in 2002, a Nvidia spokesman, Derek Perez, said. Mr. Bernstein said he expected that Nvidia's earnings would push the stock price to $60 a share by mid-2002. That may not be high enough to justify an investment, he said, considering the riskiness of the video game market. ''You would have to be an aggressive investor to buy it here,'' Mr. Bernstein said. Flextronics may be a more conservative choice. Despite layoffs of about 10,000 employees in late October, or 15 percent of its work force, and a quarterly loss of $330 million, the company has weathered the technology slump relatively well, many analysts said. Because Flextronics makes telecommunications equipment, hand-held computers and a number of other electronic and computer products for a range of major companies, it is not as dependent on Xbox. ''In looking at its business, the Xbox isn't a significant percentage of Flextronics' revenues,'' said Dominic Vignola, an analyst for the Merrill Lynch Global Technology fund. ''But it has the opportunity for a deepening relationship with Microsoft.'' In the last month, Flextronics shares have risen 14 percent, but they are down 22 percent since Jan. 1. Mr. Vignola said Flextronics' business of manufacturing products for companies like Cisco Systems, Microsoft, Lucent Technologies and other major technology players should grow rapidly as those companies focus more of their resources on research and marketing. Wall Street analysts are expecting Xbox to contribute roughly $150 million a quarter to the revenues of Flextronics. Mr. Bernstein's fund is projecting 18 percent revenue growth, which, he said, could push the stock close to $40 over the next six to nine months. It closed on Friday at $22.20. BUT the estimates depend on the success of the Xbox. Ray Scanlon, a software industry analyst at Citigroup Asset Management, said that if Microsoft reaches its sales goal, the Xbox can contribute more than $2 billion of the firm's total estimated revenues of $27 billion in the 2002 fiscal year. That would still consign gaming to the second tier of Microsoft's product line in economic importance, behind the operating system and software divisions, Mr. Scanlon said. Microsoft is likely to keep investing heavily in Xbox for the next couple of years to compete with the two dominant players in the market, Sony and Nintendo, he said. But if Microsoft ever decides to abandon the venture, he said, Flextronics probably has the balance to bounce back from such a debacle better than Nvidia. ''For Flex, within a quarter or two, it could make acquisitions that would make up for or exceed what it loses with Xbox,'' Mr. Bernstein said. ''It's a conservative man's way to play the Xbox.''"

                "SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 12— Imagine your blender breaking down twice. The vacuum cleaner giving up the ghost three times. The espresso maker repeatedly going kaput. Then imagine replacing the item with the same model over and over while keeping your brand loyalty and sanity. Stephano Nevarez can. Since he first bought his $400 Microsoft Xbox 360 in 2006, it has failed three times. Each time, he sent the game machine back to the company and waited weeks for a repair or a replacement. “There’s nothing in the house that breaks down as much,” said Stephano, a 15-year-old high school student from Salem, Ore. Yet he remains a devotee of his 360 console, the more so because he wants to play Halo 3, the latest iteration of a violent space epic due in stores on Sept. 25; it is available only for that game machine.  The game, published by Microsoft, could redeem the company going into the holiday selling season. Untold numbers of 360 owners have watched their machines break down, and then, in many cases, watched the replacement consoles do the exact same thing because of a severe and widespread manufacturing flaw.  But if the Xbox players keep coming back because of Halo 3, and if other gamers buy the console just for the game, then Microsoft could markedly improve its standing in its battle against rivals Sony and Nintendo.  “Halo 3 is Microsoft’s most important game,” said Dan Hsu, editor in chief of Electronic Gaming Monthly, a magazine for enthusiasts. Mr. Hsu, who has seen the game, said it delivers in spades, with one caveat: “Assuming your machine does work, it does what it sets out to do.” The bar is high. Combined, Halo and Halo 2 have sold around 15 million units, making the series one of the most successful game franchises of all time. The game has spawned novels, comic books and a possible movie. The $12.5 billion console and video game business is up for grabs this year. On the console side, Nintendo is off to an unexpectedly strong start with its Wii, a game system that makes its players get up off the couch and move their bodies to direct action.  It has well over 28 percent of the American console market, according to NPD Group, a market analysis firm. The Wii is currently selling at a faster pace than the 360, and the company is releasing its big games this fall, Super Mario Galaxy and Super Smash Bros. Brawl, though neither is as popular as Halo.  Sony, with about 14 percent of the market, was hurt when the release date of Grand Theft Auto IV, a game it was counting on to increase console sales, was pushed back from October into the second quarter of next year.  Microsoft, which has 57 percent of the market, has declined to say what is causing some of its Xbox 360 to stop working, or how many machines have been affected. It has set aside $1.1 billion for repairs, a figure that suggests to industry analysts that the problem could affect a third of the 11.6 million 360s already in the hands of consumers. Microsoft has said that it will fix any faulty Xbox 360 free of charge. The most likely explanation of where the engineers went wrong is that the 360s are poorly designed to deal with the intense heat generated by game play and that computer chips and other electronics may be popping off the motherboard, said Richard Doherty, an analyst with the Envisioneering Group, a technology assessment and market research firm. Mr. Doherty said he thinks that Microsoft, in an effort to put is machine into the market a year ahead of the Sony PlayStation 3, had skimped on product testing. He said that the failure rate among 360s is almost unheard-of among consumer electronics, where having even 1 percent or 2 percent of machines fail is considered a major problem. He has been doing surveys of video game consumers, and results suggest that their patience is waning and that news of the problems is dissuading some potential buyers, he said. Even die-hard users, he said, are wondering why they cannot take their machine to a store to have it checked out, rather than wait for it to break. “It’s dissipating a tremendous amount of momentum they built up prior to July,” Mr. Doherty said, referring to when Microsoft first publicly discussed its $1.1 billion repair fund. “This is going to get worse before it gets better.” But some financial analysts said that the eventual damage to reputation and revenue may not be so profound. Evan Wilson, an equity analyst with Pacific Crest Securities, said he thought that Microsoft’s fix-it-free policy had mollified many avid game players who have been among the first to purchase the 360. Aaron Greenberg, group product manager for Xbox 360, said the repair campaign is aggressive and that the company, while it is not discussing what has gone wrong, is not taking the failures lightly. “It’s our equivalent of the Blue Screen of Death people talk about with Windows,” he said, referring to the derogatory vernacular used to describe what happens when a PC running Microsoft’s operating system mysteriously stops working. In the case of the Xbox 360, affected users have taken to calling the problem the Three Red Rings of Death. That’s because when the 360 dies, three lights on the front of the console blink red. “It started getting really loud,” said Michael White, 27, of Montreal, a high school teacher, who said his system died in April. “You expect somebody’s expensive product to be more durable than that.” Is he infuriated? Not really. “I’m a happy customer,” he said, given it only took three weeks to repair and he likes the games on the system. Others are feeling slightly less generous — or, at least, their spouses are. “My wife told me she didn’t want me to buy anymore Microsoft consoles,” said Joshua Bridges, an accountant in Spring, Tex. “But I told her I’m a huge fan of the games that come out for this platform.” Chief among his interests is Halo 3. He said he likes the fast-twitch action, but particularly the story, which involves soldiers battling against an alien race called the Covenant for control of a destructive force called the Halo. Halo 3 is the last in a trilogy. When it comes out on Sept. 25, the avid fans will be waiting in line at video game retailers across the country. More than one million units have already been ordered.  For the last three years, a team of 250 full-time and part-time designers and engineers at Bungie Studios, the development house that is owned by Microsoft, have been assembling Halo 3, said Frank O’Connor, the game’s head writer. (He declined to say how much money they spent on the game). Developers felt enormous pressure, he said, and he hopes this version will be the most popular ever, particularly given new features, like the ability of players to record and make short movies of the action they just played. “Instead of being able to say: remember the time I did that one thing? Now they’ll be able to save it and show it,” Mr. O’Connor said. One question is whether it can help Microsoft sell more consoles to mainstream consumers, or to those who may be concerned about the reliability of the 360 systems. But there is little doubt the faithful will be there in force, and thrilled about it, having forgiven Microsoft for the flaws in its console. “I’m on my third 360,” said Benjamin Lin, an 18-year-old Halo enthusiast from Seattle, “and it’s working great for me.”"

                "Ethan Thomas is an F.B.I. agent hunting serial killers and Kameo is a princess who must save her family, but both have a much more important objective: to persuade gamers to spend $300 on Microsoft's new game console, the Xbox 360. Ethan and Kameo are among the first wave of video-game protagonists for the 360. Ethan stars in Monolith's action-horror game Condemned: Criminal Origins as a G-man on the trail of the man who framed him for murder. The search has Ethan creeping, flashlight in hand, through a series of abandoned buildings populated by violent junkies and, later on, humanoid creatures that skitter along the ground. To survive you have to improvise weapons, arming yourself with a mannequin arm, a piece of steam pipe or the blade from a paper cutter, although from time to time you find a handy fire ax or even a gun loaded with a handful of bullets. Your attackers are smart, hiding behind pillars to ambush you. You can paralyze one with your Taser and grab his weapon, but your foe will immediately rearm by pulling a pipe off a wall or grabbing a table leg. Combat is well done and exciting, but other parts of the game are annoying. The biggest aggravation is locating specific weapons to get through doors; an ax breaks through a wooden door, but only a shovel can snap open the lock on a metal gate. Movement is slow; you can sprint short distances but generally are forced to walk, which creates tension when you enter a room but is infuriating when you just want to quickly run through the halls to find a shovel. To make things worse, by default sprinting is initiated by the awkward method of pushing the left analog stick on the controller, although you can assign sprint to the left trigger, which then forces you to use the left analog stick for blocking attacks. Someone should be hit a couple of times in the head with a mannequin arm for that decision. Like Monolith's recent shooter F.E.A.R., Condemned has an intriguing premise that completely falls apart by the end, but while the game's designers should consider taking a few writing classes, they really know how to scare people. It is wonderfully creepy to walk through a deserted, ruined shopping mall as Christmas Muzak endlessly plays. The game is also creepy in another way; you spend much of it essentially beating homeless people to death with pipes. Admittedly, these people attack you, and in fact will often attack and kill one another if you just get out of their way, but I still found it disturbing. Depicting homeless junkies as subhuman monsters unsettles me, although this is less of an issue later in the game as your enemies become increasingly grotesque. It is less disquieting to battle the trolls and rock creatures that populate Rare's considerably lighter action-adventure game Kameo: Elements of Power, in which the titular hero is able to transform herself into a variety of useful creatures. After her family is kidnapped by a troll king in league with her evil sister, Kameo's rescue attempt ends abruptly with the loss of the elemental powers that allow her to transform. The powers, each represented by a cute creature held captive by a shadow demon, must be freed one by one. With each rescue Kameo gains the ability to become that creature and use its powers to access new areas of the game. As the yetilike beast Chilla she can climb ice walls, while as a living ball called Major Ruin she can roll up ramps. Kameo can also use special, hard-to-find flowers to upgrade her creature's powers; the dragon Ash proved extremely useful in battles after I gained the power to release fire tornadoes to suck in enemies. Kameo is generally enjoyable but hampered by awkward controls; it is difficult to aim projectiles, and the underwater levels in which you must use Kameo's aquatic incarnation Deep Blue are utterly painful as you laboriously try to steer through the water and desperately try to aim water missiles in the right direction. The game also has an incredibly annoying help system. The hints it gives are useful, but the game won't shut up about them. As you play, a voice constantly repeats that help is available, as if even after being told the first 100 times the designers were convinced you would forget. You can make the voice shut up by turning off hints, but then when you need help you have to go into options and turn hints on, then turn them off again after, so you don't have to listen to the game blather on. Kameo is most notable for its gorgeously rendered graphics. The 360's processing power allows for many nice visual effects and lets the game put an amazing number of objects on screen. It is stunning the first time the camera pulls back from a troll battle to show what seem to be thousands of soldiers grappling. Kameo is among the most graphically advanced console games on the market, yet I was considerably more entranced this month by Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King, a turn-based role-playing game developed by Level 5 for the aging PlayStation 2 console. With a simple, pastoral cartoon style reminiscent of the films of Hayao Miyazaki and a lovely symphonic score, Dragon has a low-key charm and humor that trump cutting-edge graphics. Dragon is the episodic tale of a band of adventurers searching for the evil sorcerer Dhoulmagus. Following reports of the sorcerer, they travel from town to town, along the way helping the occasional distressed stranger. As with any role-playing game, most of your time is spent fighting off random monster attacks. Enemies tend to be more goofy than frightening; and you will face cat monsters that occasionally stop attacking to lick themselves, or giant frogs that turn around to reveal that their backsides are long-tongued demonic faces that attack by licking. Your party fights with weapons and magic, although each member can learn some other interesting skills. One female character can stop a monster from attacking by throwing a kiss, paralyzing it with desire. There's nothing especially original in Dragon's old-fashioned gameplay, but it does it all beautifully. The game also works hard to root out the most annoying traits of role-playing games. Unlike games in which you spend an hour fighting monsters, gaining better weaponry and skills only to die in a big battle and lose all your progress, in this game the death of everyone in your party simply results in the loss of some gold and your return to the nearest town. The game offers shortcuts to previously visited locales and a way to exit dungeons instantly. Dragon has witty dialogue, interesting characters and engaging battles, yet for me it is perhaps most notable for being one of the least annoying role-playing games ever made. Dragon proves that, while the 360 is a beautiful machine whose elegant design and raw power easily best the competition, you don't really need it. If you have an Xbox 360, Kameo and Condemned are both worth playing, but neither is essential. Great games come when game designers know a platform well enough to concentrate on their vision rather than the technology, so expect the best 360 games to turn up in a few years. Just around the time Microsoft comes out with a brand-new console.

                "The transition to a new generation of video game consoles kicks off tonight at midnight when retailers begin selling Microsoft's Xbox 360. The event is a much-anticipated step in an intensifying business battle between Microsoft, a relative newcomer to the video game industry, and Sony and Nintendo. Sony plans to release its own successor console, PlayStation 3, in the spring, while Nintendo is expected to follow later in 2006. The new consoles are, in general, considerably more powerful than their predecessors, but they will be more expensive, as will the games made to be played on them. The high-end version of the Xbox 360 is priced at $399 and the basic version at $299, though some enthusiasts are not blinking. \"I'll be there at midnight,\" said Ibe Ozobia Jr., 31, who said he planned to pick up his new Xbox at a local retailer in Las Vegas, where he lives. Mr. Ozobia placed an advance order for the console in June, making sure he would not miss out if there is a shortage. And, he said, he likes to be on the cutting edge. \"I can't deal with old technology,\" said Mr. Ozobia, who works in technical support at a computer company and spends 30 hours a week playing video games. For Microsoft, the challenge is whether it can build its base of consumers beyond the hard-core game players that supported the first version of the Xbox, which came out in 2001. A key to Microsoft's success is whether there will be enough mainstream video games to attract a range of consumers to the console, industry analysts said. Analysts have said it is too soon to say whether that is the case, though they consider the number of games available at the outset, 18, to be relatively healthy. Some Wall Street analysts said they were puzzled by the question of how many consoles would be immediately available for sale. Microsoft has declined to comment about its supply, leaving analysts to estimate that there are two million to three million to be distributed in North America, Europe and Japan. Sales in Europe begin on Dec. 3, and in Japan on Dec. 10. Microsoft has said that within 90 days, it expects to ship 2.75 million to 3 million consoles worldwide. Wall Street analysts expect a shortage in the United States, with some saying Microsoft has purposely stoked demand beyond the company's ability to meet it. Indeed, some stores have already sold out their allotment through advance orders and Internet sales. GameStop, the nation's biggest video game specialty retailer with 3,500 stores, sold out its initial order two weeks ago. Individual stores have been calling consumers, telling them to show up within 48 hours of the introduction or risk forfeiting their console and receiving a refund, said Chris Olivera, a GameStop spokesman. Microsoft is \"trying to turn this into the Cabbage Patch Kids,\" said Michael Pachter, an analyst with Wedbush Morgan Securities. He said he expected Microsoft to constantly publicize stories of stores that were sold out to inspire press coverage and water-cooler talk of when the next shipment would arrive. \"It's brilliant marketing.\" Molly O'Donnell, a Microsoft spokeswoman, said the company was not trying to pique demand by holding down supply or withholding inventory from retailers. \"The reality is that our manufacturing facilities are running at full capacity and churning out as many consoles as humanly possible,\" Ms. O'Donnell said."

                "LOS ANGELES — The latest video game consoles can play Internet radio, Netflix movies and YouTube video clips. But Sony and Microsoft, gearing up for a blistering battle in retail stores this holiday season, are reassuring consumers that their consoles are very much about games, too. That message was particularly forceful from Microsoft at the annual Electronic Entertainment Expo, or E3, game convention here, where the biggest companies in the games business show many of the products they will release later in the year. A year ago, Microsoft was promoting its Xbox One as an all-in-one entertainment system for the living room, one that could play games and then seamlessly shift to let people watch television, and change the channels with voice commands. On Monday, though, Microsoft shifted the conversation decisively back to games, announcing a lineup of almost two dozen titles, many of them hard-core shooting games, to be released on the Xbox this year, including an anthology of classic games based on the Halo science-fiction shooter series. “Our goal is to make Xbox One the best place to play games in this generation,” said Phil Spencer, the head of Microsoft’s Xbox business, who received vigorous applause when he declared that Microsoft would dedicate the event entirely to games. While the change in emphasis may seem subtle, it comes after Microsoft was forced to respond to the success of Sony, its main competitor in the games business. Both companies introduced their new game systems in November, but Sony’s PlayStation 4 has held a decisive lead on Microsoft from the beginning. Microsoft said Monday that the company has sold more than five million Xbox Ones. Last month, Sony said it has sold more than seven million PlayStation 4s. At its own event Monday evening, Sony revealed its own slate of upcoming games for the PlayStation 4, including Little Big Planet 3, a new version of a popular adventure game with a character called Sackboy. Sony also said Grand Theft Auto V, a huge hit released previously for older consoles, will be released on the PlayStation 4 in the fall. It will also be published for Xbox One and PCs. Andrew House, the president and chief executive of Sony Computer Entertainment, said the company’s vision is to make sure that its console is “above all else the place to play.” But Sony placed a spotlight on its broader entertainment ambitions, too. The company said it would produce original television content that will be streamed over the Internet to its console, including a show based on “Powers,” a graphic novel about two homicide detectives who investigate superheroes. Microsoft has announced similar plans for original shows. Sony has also sought to out-innovate Microsoft with plans, announced previously, to develop a virtual reality headset, called Project Morpheus, that will immerse PlayStation 4 players in 3-D worlds. Part of Microsoft’s disadvantage came from being more ambitious about the technology in the Xbox One, which includes the Kinect camera and microphone device. The Kinect allows people to play games and operate other functions with body movements and voice commands, and has been included with the console. The extra technology translated into a $499 price tag for the Xbox One, $100 more than for the PlayStation 4. Sony deftly exploited that and other missteps by Microsoft to portray itself as the more gamer-friendly console maker. In response, Microsoft recently announced it planned to introduce a $399 console without Kinect, which went on sale Monday. “They’re back on message,” said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, referring to the change in Microsoft’s emphasis. Game developers still seem eager to create products for Microsoft’s system. The company and its partners showed new versions of “Assassin’s Creed” and “Call of Duty,” two blockbuster franchises that are likely to be big sellers this holiday season. One of the most enthusiastic responses Microsoft got was for the Halo anthology, “Halo: The Masterchief Collection,” which will allow people to play four older installments of the series on the Xbox One console with improved graphics. Microsoft will not release an entirely new version of Halo, known as “Halo 5: Guardians,” until next year. But Microsoft said people purchasing the anthology would be able to participate in a test of the multiplayer abilities of the new game later this year. Microsoft showed another exclusive Xbox game called “Sunset Overdrive,” a kinetic shooting game set in an apocalyptic urban landscape populated by mutants. Sony and Microsoft have both enjoyed strong sales of their new systems, partly because a third competitor, Nintendo, has struggled with its latest console, the Wii U. All three are being forced to adapt to a market where smartphones and tablets are becoming the most common devices for playing games. In an interview, Mr. Spencer of Microsoft commended Sony for its strong showing since it introduced the PlayStation 4. He said he had no intention of allowing his competitor to keep a lead on Microsoft. “I’m in this to win,” he said."

                "Josh Roberts got his first video game system — Atari — when he was 4, and since then, “I’ve had all the latest and greatest systems,” said Mr. Roberts, 27, an advertising account executive. The roster includes various versions of Nintendo, Sega and Sony PlayStation, the original Microsoft Xbox and now its latest iteration, Xbox 360.   Last year when Mr. Roberts moved with his wife from Los Angeles to Memphis, he didn’t have cable for several months. So he began using his Xbox 360 for something more than his standard fare of games like Guitar Hero II and Madden NFL: he downloaded episodes of his beloved “South Park” as well as the occasional movie in high definition, for fees running from $2 to $6 through Xbox LIVE Marketplace, the emporium accessed through the console’s interface.  “I’ll sometimes also look and see what the top downloads are and check them out too,” he said.   With the continued rise of video gaming — sales of the Xbox 360 have hit 10 million — consumers in that highly prized demographic of males from 18 to 24 are being drawn away from the entertainment provided by the small screen and the multiplex. To bring them back to the fold — and to compete with Apple’s iTunes — Microsoft and its content providers, among them Paramount Pictures, New Line, Warner Brothers, MTV, CBS, A&E and ABC are engaged in some serious outreach.  “We need to find viewers wherever they are,” said Michele Ganeless, the executive vice president and general manager of Comedy Central. “Some of them are firing up their Xbox rather than their cable box. They have so many entertainment options. Being on Xbox is a perfect way for us to reach them in their own environment.”  Since late last November, through the console interface and a points card available in $5 increments from chains like Best Buy, Xbox LIVE Marketplace has offered video-on-demand downloads of movies, often in high definition, and download-to-own episodes of television shows. Microsoft declined to give revenue figures for the service, but claims it has grown by double-digit figures each month since it was introduced. Membership at the basic level is free and as simple as signing up on iTunes.  “We allow a consumer who’s very engaged in games to shift, with the same box, to watching ‘The Departed,’ ” said Ross Honey, senior director of the media entertainment group at Microsoft, referring to Martin Scorsese’s Oscar-winning movie.   Xbox LIVE Marketplace also has some exclusive content, for example, a no-cost high-definition version of a “South Park” episode and some first-look content. Before “The Sarah Silverman Program” appeared on Comedy Central, the first episode was available free in the Marketplace.  There’s a similar plan in place for “American Body Shop,” a series that begins on Comedy Central on July 8; starting yesterday, its premiere episode was available for free download to Xbox LIVE’s more than six million members.   The service currently offers more than 2,000 hours of programming. To prevent piracy, consumers have 24 hours to watch rented material before it is automatically expunged from the console’s hard drive.   “The people we’ve partnered with see this as a good way to re-connect with the consumer,” said Mr. Honey.  For example, the high-definition “South Park” episode which has, thus far, been downloaded almost 400,000 times, contained a message urging viewers to watch for the series’ new season. Warner Brothers promoted the theatrical release of the film “300” on the Marketplace interface.   “We’ve seen tremendous results,” said Michele Edelman, vice president of marketing for Warner Brothers digital distribution whose offerings include current television shows like “Supernatural” and “One Tree Hill,” classic fare like “CHiPs” “The Dukes of Hazzard,” “Scooby Doo” “Yogi Bear,” as well as movies.  And some platforms encourage their own hits. When Warner released “Beerfest” to the rental market, the gross-out comedy became the No. 1 offering on the VOD Xbox platform, according to Ms. Edelman.  “It might be buried in a video store, and on Xbox it’s been able to rise to the top,” she said.  The visual sophistication of gamers is such that they are largely unsatisfied by traditional television broadcasts, said James L. McQuivey, a principal analyst at Forrester Research. “It’s very smart of Microsoft to realize, ‘We’ve got the customers, we already have an Internet connection for millions of boxes, let’s see what other visual treats we can feed them.’ ”  Mr. McQuivey added, “From all the data I’ve seen behind closed doors, it does work.”   What is good for Xbox’s best consumer, the young male gaming enthusiast, Mr. Honey hopes will be good for other segments of the population.  The goal is to broaden the consumer base with younger offerings like Nickelodeon’s animated series “Fairly OddParents.” According to Mr. Honey, Microsoft did a brisk business with a high-definition version of “Happy Feet” when a few weeks ago it was added to the offerings on the service.  “We absolutely believe that ‘Happy Feet’ being available brought families to use Xbox in a way they haven’t used it before,” he said. “And when you bring them there, they start to browse around.”  Indeed, Mr. Roberts of Memphis says that although his wife does not play video games at all, “the movie and TV service on ‘Live’ has her using the Xbox. Because of the service she knows how to navigate the user interface to download the content she wants.”   Anita Frazier, an industry analyst for the NPD Group, a sales and marketing research firm, says Xbox’s expansion of services makes sense.  “It’s where entertainment delivery is headed. It’s a natural evolution for any of these boxes, whether it’s a computer or an Xbox or a PlayStation 3 or Apple TV to deliver a variety of content and whether it’s games or music or TV or movies.”  But, she added, “a lot of it is going to hinge on the user interface and how easy it is to accomplish the downloads.” Not always so easy, according to Mr. McQuivey. “The movie feature as currently arranged is no better than traditional video on demand. The titles are hard to find,” he said, adding, “There are operational things that need to be resolved before they can take it to the next level.”   Mr. Roberts has downloaded a few high-definition movies and “it took hours,” he said. “I don’t think the broadband technology is there yet.” He also finds the Microsoft points card (80 points equals one dollar) an annoying and slightly confusing system.  “It’s like at a carnival where you need two tickets to buy a drink and three tickets to buy a hot dog,” he said. “I’d rather know what I’m paying, and I’d like to see that transaction made in dollars rather than points.”   Xbox LIVE Marketplace, he added, “is not yet at a place where I think it’s made my life easier or more entertaining in my leisure time, but I’m excited for the potential. When it moves faster and the bandwidth is great, then I think it will be very cool.”"

                "WASHINGTON — In late January, as China locked down some provinces to contain the spread of the coronavirus, average internet speeds in the country slowed as people who were stuck inside went online more and clogged the networks. In Hubei Province, the epicenter of infections, mobile broadband speeds fell by more than half. In mid-February, when the virus hit Italy, Germany and Spain, internet speeds in those countries also began to deteriorate. And last week, as a wave of stay-at-home orders rolled out across the United States, the average time it took to download videos, emails and documents increased as broadband speeds declined 4.9 percent from the previous week, according to Ookla, a broadband speed testing service. Median download speeds dropped 38 percent in San Jose, Calif., and 24 percent in New York, according to Broadband Now, a consumer broadband research site. Quarantines around the world have made people more reliant on the internet to communicate, work, learn and stay entertained. But as the use of YouTube, Netflix, Zoom videoconferencing, Facebook calls and videogaming has surged to new highs, the stress on internet infrastructure is starting to show in Europe and the United States — and the traffic is probably far from its peak. “This is totally unprecedented,” said Thierry Breton, a European Union commissioner who oversees digital policy and was a chief executive of France Télécom. “We have to be proactive.” To head off problems, European regulators like Mr. Breton have pushed streaming companies such as Netflix and YouTube to reduce the size of their video files so they don’t take up as much bandwidth. In the United States, regulators have given wireless carriers access to more spectrum to bolster the capacity of their networks. Some tech companies have responded to the call to ease internet traffic. YouTube, which is owned by Google, said this week that it would reduce the quality of its videos from high to standard definition across the globe. Disney delayed the start of its Disney Plus streaming service in France by two weeks, and Microsoft’s Xbox asked gaming companies to introduce online updates and new releases only at certain times to prevent network congestion. “We really don’t know how long we’re going to be in this mode for,” Dave Temkin, Netflix’s vice president of network and systems infrastructure, said in a webinar on Wednesday on how the coronavirus could affect internet infrastructure. Internet service providers like Comcast, Vodafone, Verizon and Telefónica have been building out their networks for years to account for increasing demand. But company officials said they had never seen such a steep, sudden surge. Growth that the industry had expected to take a year is happening over days, said Enrique Blanco, the chief technology officer at Telefónica, a Spanish telecommunications company. “In just two days we grew all the traffic we had planned for 2020,” Mr. Blanco said. On Monday, traffic on AT&T’s networks was up 27 percent compared to the same day last month, and last week Verizon experienced a 22 percent increase in traffic on its wireless and fiber broadband service. Wi-Fi calls doubled from their normal volume, the carriers said. In Europe, internet traffic into homes over fixed lines was up more than 30 percent, according to Telefónica. Activities like online gaming and video conferencing have more than doubled, while messages over WhatsApp have more than quadrupled. So much traffic and stress on internet networks has slowed the speed of downloading web pages and apps, according to Ookla. “Congestion is higher,” said Adriane Blum, an Ookla spokeswoman. “We’re all at home, and the activities we’re doing in this unprecedented time are not low-bandwidth usage, which means a lot of activity on a network.” Cisco said demand for its WebEx teleconference service had tracked the spread of the coronavirus. Demand first surged in Asia, then in Europe, and last week it soared 240 percent in the United States. The demand has pushed up failure rates delivering video conferencing, said Sri Srinivasan, a Cisco senior vice president in charge of WebEx. “I don’t know if we’ll soon see a peak, not for weeks to come,” he said. “The reason I say that is because we aren’t seeing traffic in Asia slow down even now.” Internet service providers said they could handle the deluge of traffic but were adding capacity. Verizon, Cox and AT&T said they were building more cell sites to strengthen mobile networks, increasing the number of fiber connections on their network backbones, and upgrading the routing and switching technology that lets devices talk to one another and share an internet connection. Orange, formerly France Télécom, has doubled its capacity inside undersea internet cables. In Italy, where home internet use is up 90 percent, Telecom Italia said its technicians continued to make repairs and add capacity. Vodafone, one of Europe’s largest networks operators, said it had increased its capacity 50 percent in recent weeks through a mix of software and the addition of more equipment in the field. “We’re seeing some signs of stress,” AT&T’s chief executive, Randall Stephenson, said in an interview on CNN on Sunday. “We’re having to go out and do some augmentation of networks, and so we’re sending our employees out there to get that done, but right now the network is performing quite well.” To prevent clogged networks, Europe has taken the most aggressive steps. Last week, Mr. Breton, the European Union commissioner, discussed reducing the bitstreams of videos with Reed Hastings, the chief executive of Netflix; Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Google; and Susan Wojcicki, the head of YouTube. The companies agreed, as did Amazon for its Prime Video streaming service and Twitch, its online gaming platform. Many of the companies then went further. On Tuesday, Netflix decided to switch its high-definition video streams in India, Australia and Latin America to slightly lower quality to reduce the traffic they create there by 25 percent, and YouTube said it would make all global streams standard definition. “We continue to work closely with governments and network operators around the globe to do our part to minimize stress on the system during this unprecedented situation,” YouTube said in a statement. Microsoft’s Xbox gaming business recently asked large gaming companies to release online updates of their games during off-peak hours while it helped focus on the critical internet needs of people involved in the coronavirus crisis, according to an Xbox email reviewed by The New York Times. Video game updates can require great amounts of bandwidth to download. Xbox asked the companies to release updates in a four-hour overnight window in North America, and only from Monday through Thursday. “Microsoft is actively monitoring performance and usage trends to ensure we’re optimizing service for our customers worldwide, and accommodating new growth and demand,” the company said. “At the same time, these are unprecedented times, and we’re also taking proactive steps to plan for these high-usage periods.” While U.S. regulators said they did not plan to follow Europe in asking for streaming and social media companies to degrade their services, they are taking other steps. Last week, the Federal Communications Commission granted Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile temporary access to more airwaves. “The F.C.C. has been coordinating closely with network operators to ensure those networks remain up and running,” Ajit Pai, the agency’s chairman, said in a statement. Telefónica’s Mr. Blanco, who has been living under a lockdown in Spain, said he expected the record traffic to last for some time. It may even become the new normal, he said. In Spain, internet use drops only at 8 p.m., when people across the country go to their windows to cheer health workers and others who are helping to manage the crisis. “Suddenly at 8 p.m. it goes down, then it goes back up,” Mr. Blanco said. “It’s a beautiful thing.” Cecilia Kang reported from Washington, Davey Alba from New York and Adam Satariano from London.

                "The last time I was unemployed was in the depths of the Great Recession. I had recently moved in with my girlfriend, who suddenly found herself with an out-of-work partner who rarely left the house. But she gave me some surprising advice: Play video games. I would have a lot of time on my hands, she said, and while I could and should certainly do other things — housework, exercise, searching for a job — I would mostly be stuck at home with limited resources. Without something to occupy my mind, I’d go crazy. She was right. Playing video games helped ease my mind, elevate my mood and possibly saved our relationship. This year we’ll celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary. So now I’m going to give the same advice to anyone who is now out of work, or otherwise kept at home: Play video games. And don’t feel bad about it. If you’re not a gamer, you might think of video games as simple time-wasters. But for those stuck mostly inside without work, killing time is a real problem. And in the world of big-budget console games, 10 to 15 hours is a fairly short experience. Some can take hundreds of hours to complete. There are online games designed to be played and replayed for thousands of hours. But games are more than just empty time-wasters. In periods of pain, boredom or personal emptiness, video games can serve as palliative care for both the body and the mind. Think of gaming as a personal stimulus plan for a nation of unexpected shut-ins: It’s not a long-term solution, it won’t work for everyone, and it won’t solve the underlying problems — but it can provide limited, temporary relief for some. Video games take many forms, but they are all essentially simulations. And when the real world is temporarily unavailable, a simulated version might be what we need. Among other things, video games simulate work: Even the simplest games give players tasks, objectives, lists of things they have to do, problems to solve and a sense of accomplishment upon completion. And the biggest modern games offer seemingly endless lists of quests and objectives, tasks and subtasks, systems to learn and skills to be mastered. A game like the online shooter Destiny 2 offers hundreds, if not thousands, of hours of play, exploration and study. Set in an intricately designed sci-fi world, it tasks players with taking out wave after wave of alien enemies. It also rewards them for understanding a complex character progression system that involves completing ever-more-difficult goals and objectives, sometimes multiple times, in exchange for rarer and more powerful weapons and armor. You might not actually accomplish anything after a day spent checking off quests and gathering virtual materials, but you’ll feel like you did. Game critics have noted the worklike nature of many modern games for years, not always favorably. But in a world of stay-at-home mass unemployment, even the illusion of accomplishment is probably better than none at all. Indeed, the particular shut-in nature of our current crisis makes video games unusually relevant in a different way: What video games do better than any other medium is simulate places. Open-world games like Skyrim, Red Dead Redemption II or The Witcher 3 are built around giant, explorable spaces, sometimes the virtual equivalent of hundreds of square miles, with elaborate geography and shifting weather. They can take days or weeks to fully explore and at their best can be unexpectedly beautiful, offering the opportunity to encounter animated versions of sun-dappled vistas or foggy mountain peaks, to wander through crowded city streets or stroll past others on well-trod footpaths. Games can give us someplace else to go. That makes games useful in another way. Some of us are shut in alone. But especially in cities, many are now effectively trapped inside modest apartments with family or roommates, and little private space. Games offer a form of personal escape, a way to simulate being elsewhere from the confines of your couch. And for those who are alone, games can also serve as social spaces, virtual fields of play for cooperative adventures or competitive contests. Many of today’s most popular games are online experiences that allow players to engage with friends as well as strangers, to forge digital versions of the same sort of bonds with teammates that can develop in the real world. If you’re new at this, the cost of entry is fairly low: There are thousands of high-quality games available for phones, and many more available to download directly to your computer. Even better, many big-budget games are free if you have a computer or game console on which to play them. Late last year, Destiny 2, released in 2017 as a full-priced game, reinvented itself as a free-to-play experience, with the base game available at no cost (players can pay for expansions). Several of the “battle royale” games that have defined the new wave of first-person shooters are also free: A relatively well-reviewed recent entry, Call of Duty: Warzone, offers several clever twists on the popular last-player-standing formula. Not everyone wants to play online shooters, but for those willing to spend a little there are now subscription services that offer access to a large library of games for an annual or monthly fee. For little more than the price of a standard Netflix plan, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate offers access to dozens of games, from moody, philosophical puzzle games like The Talos Principle to richly animated platformers like Ori and the Will of the Wisps. There are sports games, strategy games, role-playing games and simple twitchy diversions that recall the arcade games I pumped quarters into as a kid. And for those who not satisfied with our current quasi-apocalypse, there even games about viral outbreaks and attacks, from the strategic epidemic simulator Plague Inc., to the deftly scripted post-pandemic action game The Last of Us, to The Division 2, a military thriller set in emptied-out recreations of downtown Washington and New York after a viral bioweapon wipes out most of the population. Maybe that one hits a little too close to home. Yes, games are frivolous. Yes, they are escapist. But the longer the coronavirus keeps social life and culture in isolation, the more we’ll need frivolity and escapism. There’s a limit, of course, to what video games can do: They can’t serve as long-term substitutes for real places, real work or real human interaction. But they can give us a simulacrum of all those things at a time when the real ones are in short supply, and tide us over until the world we actually need returns.

                "Like many young hipsters in Austin, Tex., Michael Burns wanted to make it big in some creative field -- perhaps writing comedy scripts in Hollywood. Instead, he wound up in a dead-end job, managing a call center. To kill time, he made friends with a group of equally clever and bored young men at the company where he worked, and they'd sit around talking about their shared passion: video games. Their favorite title was Halo, a best-selling Xbox game in which players control armor-clad soldiers as they wander through gorgeous coastal forests and grim military bunkers and fight an army of lizardlike aliens. Burns and his gang especially loved the \"team versus team\" mode, which is like a digital version of paint ball: instead of fighting aliens, players hook their Xboxes to the Internet, then log on together in a single game, at which point they assemble into two teams -- red-armored soldiers versus blue-armored ones. Instead of shooting aliens, they try to slaughter one another, using grenades, machine guns and death rays. On evenings and weekends, Burns and his friends would cluster around their TV's until the wee hours of the morning, gleefully blowing one another to pieces. \"Halo is like crack,\" Burns recalls thinking. \"I could play it until I die.\" Whenever a friend discovered a particularly cool stunt inside Halo -- for example, obliterating an enemy with a new type of grenade toss -- Burns would record a video of the stunt for posterity. (His friend would perform the move after Burns had run a video cord from his TV to his computer, so he could save it onto his hard drive.) Then he'd post the video on a Web site to show other gamers how the trick was done. To make the videos funnier, sometimes Burns would pull out a microphone and record a comedic voice-over, using video-editing software to make it appear as if the helmeted soldier himself were doing the talking. Then one day he realized that the videos he was making were essentially computer-animated movies, almost like miniature emulations of \"Finding Nemo\" or \"The Incredibles.\" He was using the game to function like a personal Pixar studio. He wondered: Could he use it to create an actual movie or TV series? Burns's group decided to give it a shot. They gathered around the Xbox at Burns's apartment, manipulating their soldiers like tiny virtual actors, bobbing their heads to look as if they were deep in conversation. Burns wrote sharp, sardonic scripts for them to perform. He created a comedy series called \"Red vs. Blue,\" a sort of sci-fi version of \"M*A*S*H.\" In \"Red vs. Blue,\" the soldiers rarely do any fighting; they just stand around insulting one another and musing over the absurdities of war, sounding less like patriotic warriors than like bored, clever video-store clerks. The first 10-minute episode opened with a scene set in Halo's bleakest desert canyon. Two red soldiers stood on their base, peering at two blue soldiers far off in the distance, and traded quips that sounded almost like a slacker disquisition on Iraq: Red Soldier: \"Why are we out here? Far as I can tell, it's just a box canyon in the middle of nowhere, with no way in or out. And the only reason we set up a red base here is because they have a blue base there. And the only reason they have a blue base over there is because we have a red base here.\" When they were done, they posted the episode on their Web site (surreptitiously hosted on computers at work). They figured maybe a few hundred people would see it and get a chuckle or two. Instead, \"Red vs. Blue\" became an instant runaway hit on geek blogs, and within a single day, 20,000 people stampeded to the Web site to download the file. The avalanche of traffic crashed the company server. \"My boss came into the office and was like, 'What the hell is going on?' \" Burns recalls. \"I looked over at the server, and it was going blink, blink, blink.\" Thrilled, Burns and his crew quickly cranked out another video, then another. They kept up a weekly production schedule, and after a few months, \"Red vs. Blue\" had, like some dystopian version of \"Friends,\" become a piece of appointment viewing. Nearly a million people were downloading each episode every Friday, writing mash notes to the creators and asking if they could buy a DVD of the collected episodes. Mainstream media picked up on the phenomenon. The Village Voice described it as \" 'Clerks' meets 'Star Wars,' \" and the BBC called it \"riotously funny\" and said it was \"reminiscent of the anarchic energy of 'South Park.' \" Burns realized something strange was going on. He and his crew had created a hit comedy show -- entirely inside a video game. Video games have not enjoyed good publicity lately. Hillary Clinton has been denouncing the violence in titles like Grand Theft Auto, which was yanked out of many stores last month amid news that players had unlocked sex scenes hidden inside. Yet when they're not bemoaning the virtual bloodshed, cultural pundits grudgingly admit that today's games have become impressively cinematic. It's not merely that the graphics are so good: the camera angles inside the games borrow literally from the visual language of film. When you're playing Halo and look up at the sun, you'll see a little \"lens flare,\" as if you were viewing the whole experience through the eyepiece of a 16-millimeter Arriflex. By using the game to actually make cinema, Burns and his crew flipped a switch that neatly closed a self-referential media loop: movies begat games that begat movies. And Burns and his crew aren't alone. Video-game aficionados have been creating \"machinima\" -- an ungainly term mixing \"machine\" and \"cinema\" and pronounced ma-SHEEN-i-ma -- since the late 90's. \"Red vs. Blue\" is the first to break out of the underground, and now corporations like Volvo are hiring machinima artists to make short promotional films, while MTV, Spike TV and the Independent Film Channel are running comedy shorts and music videos produced inside games. By last spring, Burns and his friends were making so much money from \"Red vs. Blue\" that they left their jobs and founded Rooster Teeth Productions. Now they produce machinima full time. It may be the most unlikely form of indie filmmaking yet -- and one of the most weirdly democratic. \"It's like 'The Blair Witch Project' all over again, except you don't even need a camera,\" says Julie Kanarowski, a product manager with Electronic Arts, the nation's largest video-game publisher. \"You don't even need actors.\" Back in college, Burns and another Rooster Teeth founder, Matt Hullum, wrote and produced a traditional live-action indie movie. It cost $9,000, required a full year to make and was seen by virtually no one. By contrast, the four Xboxes needed to make \"Red vs. Blue\" cost a mere $600. Each 10-minute episode requires a single day to perform and edit and is viewed by hordes of feverish video-game fans the planet over. More than just a cheap way to make an animated movie, machinima allows game players to comment directly on the pop culture they so devotedly consume. Much like \"fan fiction\" (homespun tales featuring popular TV characters) or \"mash-ups\" (music fans blending two songs to create a new hybrid), machinima is a fan-created art form. It's what you get when gamers stop blasting aliens for a second and start messing with the narrative. And God knows, there's plenty to mess with. These days, the worlds inside games are so huge and open-ended that gamers can roam anywhere they wish. Indeed, players often abandon the official goal of the game -- save the princess; vanquish the eldritch forces of evil -- in favor of merely using the virtual environment as a gigantic jungle gym. In one popular piece of Halo machinima, \"Warthog Jump,\" a player cunningly used the game to conduct a series of dazzling physics experiments. He placed grenades in precise locations beneath jeeps and troops, such that when the targets blew sky-high, they pinwheeled through the air in precise formations, like synchronized divers. Another gamer recorded a machinima movie that poked subversive fun at Grand Theft Auto. Instead of playing as a dangerous, cop-killing gangster, the player pretended he was a naïve Canadian tourist -- putting down his gun, dressing in tacky clothes and simply wandering around the game's downtown environment for hours, admiring the scenery. So what's it like to actually shoot a movie inside a game? In June, I visited the Rooster Teeth offices in Buda, Tex., a tiny Austin suburb, to observe Burns and his group as they produced a scene of \"Red vs. Blue.\" Burns, a tall, burly 32-year-old, sat in front of two huge flat-panel screens, preparing the editing software. Nearby were the two Rooster Teeth producers who would be acting on-screen: Geoff Ramsey, a scraggly-bearded 30-year-old whose arms are completely covered in tattoos of fish and skulls, and Gustavo Sorola, a gangly 27-year-old who sprawled in a beanbag chair and peered through his thick architect glasses at the day's e-mail. They were fan letters, Sorola told me, that pour in from teenagers who are as enthusiastic as they are incoherent. \"The way kids write these days,\" he said with a grimace. \"It's like someone threw up on the keyboard.\" In the script they were acting out that day, a pair of \"Red vs. Blue\" soldiers engaged in one of their typically pointless existential arguments, bickering over whether it's possible to kill someone with a toy replica of a real weapon. The Rooster Teeth crew recorded the voice-overs earlier in the day; now they were going to create the animation for the scene. Burns picked up a controller and booted up Halo on an Xbox. He would act as the camera: whatever his character saw would be recorded, from his point of view. Then Sorola and Ramsey logged into the game, teleporting in as an orange-suited and a red-suited soldier. Burns posed them near a massive concrete bunker and frowned as he scrutinized the view on the computer screen. \"Hmmmm,\" he muttered. \"We need something to frame you guys -- some sort of prop.\" He ran his character over to a nearby alien hovercraft, jumped in and parked it next to the actors. \"Sweet!\" he said. \"I like it!\" In a \"Red vs. Blue\" shoot, the actors all must follow one important rule: Be careful not to accidentally kill another actor. \"Sometimes you'll drop your controller and it unintentionally launches a grenade. It takes, like, 20 minutes for the blood splatters to dry up,\" Ramsey said. \"Totally ruins the scene.\" Finally, Burns was ready to go. He shouted, \"Action!\" and the voice-overs began playing over loudspeakers. Sorola and Ramsey acted in time with the dialogue. Acting, in this context, was weirdly minimalist. They mashed the controller joysticks with their thumbs, bobbing the soldiers' heads back and forth roughly in time with important words in each line. \"It's puppetry, basically,\" Ramsey said, as he jiggled his controller. Of all the \"Red vs. Blue\" crew members, Ramsey is renowned for his dexterity with an Xbox. When a scene calls for more than five actors onstage, he'll put another controller on the ground and manipulate it with his right foot, allowing him to perform as two characters simultaneously. As I watched, I was reminded of what initially cracked me up so much about \"Red vs. Blue\": the idea that faceless, anonymous soldiers in a video game have interior lives. It's a \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern\" conceit; \"Red vs. Blue\" is what the game characters talk about when we're not around to play with them. As it turns out, they're a bunch of neurotics straight out of \"Seinfeld.\" One recruit reveals that he chain-smokes inside his airtight armor; a sergeant tells a soldier his battle instructions are to \"scream like a woman.\" And, in a sardonic gloss on the game's endless carnage, none of the soldiers have the vaguest clue why they're fighting. Yet as I discovered, real-life soldiers are among the most ardent fans of \"Red vs. Blue.\" When I walked around the Rooster Teeth office, I found it was festooned with letters, plaques and an enormous American flag, gifts from grateful American troops, many of whom are currently stationed in Iraq. Isn't it a little astonishing, I asked Burns when the crew went out in the baking Texas sun for a break, that actual soldiers are so enamored of a show that portrays troops as inept cowards, leaders as cynical sociopaths and war itself as a supremely meaningless endeavor? Burns laughed, but said the appeal was nothing sinister. \" 'Red vs. Blue' is about downtime,\" he said. \"There's very little action, which is precisely the way things are in real life.\" \"He's right,\" Ramsey added. He himself spent five years in the army after high school. \"We'd just sit around digging ditches and threatening to kill each other all day long,\" he said. \"We were bored out of our minds.\" Perhaps the most unusual thing about machinima is that none of its creators are in jail. After all, they're gleefully plundering intellectual property at a time when the copyright wars have become particularly vicious. Yet video-game companies have been upbeat -- even exuberant -- about the legions of teenagers and artists pillaging their games. This is particularly bewildering in the case of \"Red vs. Blue,\" because Halo is made by Bungie, a subsidiary of Microsoft, a company no stranger to using a courtroom to defend its goods. What the heck is going on? As it turns out, people at Bungie love \"Red vs. Blue.\" \"We thought it was kind of brilliant,\" says Brian Jarrard, the Bungie staff member who manages interactions with fans. \"There are people out there who would never have heard about Halo without 'Red vs. Blue.' It's getting an audience outside the hardcore gaming crowd.\" Sure, Rooster Teeth ripped off Microsoft's intellectual property. But Microsoft got something in return: \"Red vs. Blue\" gave the game a whiff of countercultural coolness, the sort of grass-roots street cred that major corporations desperately crave but can never manufacture. After talking with Rooster Teeth, Microsoft agreed, remarkably, to let them use the game without paying any licensing fees at all. In fact, the company later hired Rooster Teeth to produce \"Red vs. Blue\" videos to play as advertisements in game stores. Microsoft has been so strangely solicitous that when it was developing the sequel to Halo last year, the designers actually inserted a special command -- a joystick button that makes a soldier lower his weapon -- designed solely to make it easier for Rooster Teeth to do dialogue. \"If you're playing the game, there's no reason to lower your weapon at all,\" Burns explained. \"They put that in literally just so we can shoot machinima.\" Other game companies have gone even further. Many now include editing software with their games, specifically to encourage fans to shoot movies. When Valve software released its hit game Half-Life 2 last year, it included \"Faceposer\" software so that machinima creators could tweak the facial expressions of characters. When the Sims 2 -- a sequel to the top-selling game of all time -- came out last year, its publisher, Electronic Arts, set up a Web site so that fans could upload their Sims 2 movies to show to the world. (About 8,000 people so far have done so.) Still, it's one thing for gamers to produce a jokey comedy or a music video. Can machinima actually produce a work of art -- something with serious emotional depth? A few people have tried. In China, a visual artist named Feng Mengbo used the first-person-shooter game Quake III to produce Q4U, in which the screen is filled with multiple versions of himself, killing one another. Players' relationships with constant, blood-splattering violence is a common subject in game art. Last year, the 31-year-old artist Brody Condon produced an unsettling film that consisted of nothing but shots of himself committing suicide inside 50 different video games. \"I try to come to terms with what taking your life means in these games,\" Condon says. \"I'm trying to understand, spiritually, your relationship with an avatar on the screen.\" But even machinima's biggest fans admit that the vast majority of machinima is pretty amateurish. \"It's like if some friends of mine all broke into a movie set, and we all got to use all the cameras and special-effects equipment,\" says Carl Goodman, director of digital media at the American Museum of the Moving Image, which began to hold an annual machinima festival two years ago. \"We wouldn't quite know how to use it, but we'd make some pretty interesting stuff.\" Yet as Goodman points out, there's a competing proposition. Machinima does not always strive to emulate \"realistic,\" artistic movies. On the contrary, it is often explicitly devoted to celebrating the aesthetics of games -- the animations and in-jokes, the precise physics. Most machinima is probably meaningless to people who don't play games, much as ESPN is opaque to anyone who doesn't watch sports. But for those who do play Halo, it was genuinely thrilling to see something like \"Warthog Jump,\" with its meticulously synchronized explosions. The Rooster Teeth crew has its own hilariously stringent rule for making machinima: no cheating. When they shoot \"Red vs. Blue,\" they do not use any special effects that are not organically included in the game; everything you see in an episode of \"Red vs. Blue\" could in theory have taken place during an actual game of Halo, played by a fan in his bedroom. It's a charmingly purist attitude, a sci-fi version of the \"Dogma\" school of indie film, which argues that movies are best when cinematic trickery is kept to a minimum. One evening in New York, I visited with Ethan Vogt as he and his machinima team shot a car-chase scene for a Volvo promo. Vogt and two producers sat at computers, logged into a multiplayer game; each producer controlled a car racing through crowded city streets, while Vogt controlled a free-floating \"camera\" that followed behind, recording the visuals. The vehicles -- an enormous 1972 Chevy Impala and a Volvo V50 -- screamed along at about 60 miles an hour, fishtailing through corners while plowing into mailboxes, lampposts and, occasionally, clots of pedestrians. The lead car burst into flames. \"That's great,\" Vogt said. \"That's great.\" Though it shares with independent filmmaking a do-it-yourself aesthetic, machinima inverts the central tradition of indie film: smallness. With their skimpy budgets, indie directors tend to set movies in kitchens or living rooms -- and focus instead on providing quality acting and scripts. Machinima, in contrast, often has horribly cheesy acting and ham-fisted, purple-prose stories -- but they're set in outer space. Want massive shootouts? Howling mob scenes? Roman gladiatorial armies clashing by night? No problem. It is the rare form of amateur film in which the directors aspire to be not Wes Anderson but George Lucas. Indeed, with video games played on computers, it is now possible to build an entire world from scratch. The core of any video game is its game engine, the software that knows how to render 3-D objects and how to realistically represent the physics of how they move, bounce or collide. But the actual objects inside the game -- the people, the cars, the guns, even the buildings -- can be altered, tweaked or replaced by modifications, or \"mods.\" Mods do not require any deep programming skills; indeed, almost any teenager with a passing acquaintance in graphic-design software can \"re-skin\" a character in a game to make it look like himself, for instance. (Xbox and PlayStation games, in comparison, are much harder to mod, because the consoles are locked boxes, designed to prevent players from tampering with the games.) I was able to see modding in action one night when I visited the ILL Clan, a pioneering machinima group. Their headquarters are the kitchen table in the cramped one-bedroom Brooklyn apartment of Frank Dellario; a lanky, hyperkinetic 42-year-old, he sat on a rickety folding chair, pecking at a keyboard. The table was littered with four computer screens and laptops, the remnants of take-out sushi and a hopelessly tangled morass of computer cords and joysticks; a huge wide-screen TV lurked behind them for viewing their work. On the night I visited, they were using a game engine called Torque to shoot a short heist movie for Audi, in which two thugs beat up a concert violinist and make off with an antique violin in a van. To quickly create a gritty-looking city, Dellario and his colleague -- ILL Clan's co-founder, Matt Dominianni -- hired a local artist to build a generic-looking urban intersection inside the game. To customize it, Dominianni went onto Google, found snapshots of a few seedy stores (an adult bookstore, a tattoo parlor and a furniture outlet) and digitally pasted them onto the front of the buildings. Then they went to a site called Turbo-Squid, a sort of Amazon for virtual in-game items, and for $45 bought a van that could be plunked down inside the game. When I arrived, they were browsing the site and contemplating buying a few women. \"My God, look at this one,\" Dellario marveled, as he clicked open a picture of an eerily realistic 3-D brunette named Masha. \"I'm going to marry this woman. They've finally broken through to total reality.\" Dellario put the van into the correct location in the scene, then logged into the game to figure out the camera angle for this shot. He frowned. It didn't look right. The lighting was all off, with shadows falling in the wrong places. Dominianni figured out the problem: \"The sun is supposed to be at high noon. It's in the wrong place.\" \"Oh, yeah,\" Dellario said. \"Let me move it.\" He pulled up a menu, clicked on the \"sun\" command, and dragged it across the sky. Now they were finally ready to shoot. Dellario realized they needed an extra pair of hands to manipulate one of the thugs. \"Want to act in this scene?\" Dellario asked, and he handed me a joystick. I sat down at one of the computers and took control of \"Thug1,\" a brown-haired man in a golf shirt and brown pants, carrying the stolen violin. Dominianni was playing \"Thug2.\" Our characters were supposed to look around to make sure the coast is clear, then jump in the truck and race off. Dellario gave me my motivation: \"It's like you hear a suspicious noise. You're nervous.\" I used the joystick to practice moving my virtual character, craning its neck -- my neck? -- back and forth. I have played plenty of video games, but this felt awfully odd. Usually when I am inside a game, I'm just worried about staying alive while the bullets whiz past my ears. I've never had to emote. While Dellario and Dominianni fiddled with the camera angle, I grew impatient and wandered around, exploring the virtual set. I peered in a few shop windows -- they were strikingly photorealistic, even up close. Then I walked down an alley and suddenly arrived at the end of the set. It was like a tiny Western town in the desert: once you got beyond the few clustered buildings, there was nothing there -- just a vast, enormous plain, utterly empty and stretching off infinitely into the distance. This spring, electronic arts decided to promote the Sims 2 by hiring Rooster Teeth to create a machinima show using the game. Called \"The Strangerhood,\" it would be freely available online. \"The Strangerhood\" is a parody of reality TV: a group of people wake up one day to discover that they are living in new houses, and they can't remember who they are or how they got there. In the Sims 2, the animated people are impressively Pixar-like and expressive, making \"The Strangerhood\" even more like a mainstream animated show than \"Red vs. Blue\"; you could almost imagine watching it on Saturday morning. The problem is, the Sims 2 has turned out to be incredibly difficult to shoot with. When the Rooster Teeth gang uses Halo for machinima, the characters are mere puppets and can be posed any way the creators want. But in the Sims 2, the little virtual characters have artificial intelligence and free will. When you're playing, you do not control all the action: the fun is in putting your Sims in interesting social situations, then standing back and watching what they'll do. When Rooster Teeth's Matt Hullum builds a virtual set and puts the \"Strangerhood\" characters in place for a shoot, he's never quite sure what will happen. To shoot a scene in which two men wake up in bed together, Hullum had to spend hours playing with the two characters -- who are nominally heterosexual -- forcing them into repeated conversations until they eventually became such good friends they were willing to share a bed. Shooting machinima with Sims is thus maddeningly like using actual, human stars: they're stubborn; they stage hissy fits and stomp off to their trailers. \"We'll do three or four takes of a scene, and one of the Sims will start getting tired and want to go to sleep,\" Hullum said. \"It's just like being on a real set. You're screaming: 'Quick, quick, get the shot! We're losing light!' \" Hullum showed me a typical \"Strangerhood\" scene. He put Nikki, a young ponytailed brunette in a baseball cap, in the kitchen to interact with Wade, a slacker who looked eerily like a digital Owen Wilson. (To give Wade a mellow, San Francisco vibe, Hullum programmed him to move at a pace 50 percent slower than the other characters.) Hullum pointed to Nikki's \"mood\" bar; it was low, which meant she was in a bad mood and wouldn't want to talk. \"When they're bored, you have to lock them in a room alone for a few hours until they start to crave conversation,\" Hullum said. He tried anyway, prodding Wade to approach her and talk about food, one of Nikki's favorite subjects. It worked. The two became engrossed in a conversation, laughing and gesticulating wildly. \"See, this footage would be great if we were shooting a scene where these guys are maybe gossiping,\" Hullum mused, as he zoomed the camera in to frame a close-up on Wade. Then Nikki started to yawn. \"Oh, damn. See -- she's getting bored. Oh, no, she's walking away,\" Hullum said, as the little virtual Nikki wandered out of the room. \"Damn. You see what we have to deal with?\" The audience for \"The Strangerhood\" has not exploded the way \"Red vs. Blue\" did. The project is a gamble: its creators hope it will break out of machinima's geeky subculture and vault into the mainstream. Though in a way, Hullum said, the mainstream isn't always a fun place to be, either. Before he returned to Austin to work on \"Red vs. Blue,\" he spent six miserable years in Hollywood working on second-rate teen movies with big budgets, like \"Scooby-Doo\" and \"The Faculty.\" \"So now to come to this, where we have total creative control of our own stuff, it's amazing,\" Hullum said, as he watched Nikki walk out of the house in search of a more interesting conversation. \"I just pray we can keep this going. Because if we can't, I'm in big trouble.\" Clive Thompson is a contributing writer for the magazine."

                "SYNTHETIC WORLDS The Business and Culture of Online Games. By Edward Castronova. 332 pp. University of Chicago Press. $29. SMARTBOMB The Quest for Art, Entertainment and Big Bucks in the Videogame Revolution. By Heather Chaplin and Aaron Ruby. 287 pp. Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill. $24.95. Here's a theory that may be neither original nor empirically defensible but feels true: The more fun an activity is, the less interesting it is to read about. War producces great journalism; water-skiing does not. Can you guess where video games fall on this spectrum? In the last few years, a great many words have been expended to report on this flourishing cultural phenomenon. Most accounts begin with a hyperactive presentation of statistics, which we will not rehearse here. This is all you need to know (and perhaps already do): Video games have grown into a huge business, outpacing the movie industry and bulldozing childhood as we knew it. We adults are not safe, either. Whether they admit it or not, you probably have friends who can be found awake at 2 a.m. disemboweling orcs, foiling terrorist plots and scooping up fumbles and running them into end zones. It is the opinion of Edward Castronova, author of \"Synthetic Worlds,\" that such electronic experiences are not merely a hedge against boredom but a profound indicator of where the entire world is heading. Online, off-line; reality, fantasy -- these distinctions will cease to matter as more and more of us pass our time in virtual environments. Economies will evolve as we pay real money for virtual goods and vice versa. Conflicts that begin online will spill into the real world and back. Laws will be written to protect our newfound interests. Castronova's vision has elements of both utopia and dystopia. But mostly he is bullish. Life in these alternative zones may eventually become so fulfilling, he contends, \"that a fairly substantial exodus may loom in the distance.\" He means this, really. Like the Irish and Italians who left their native lands in the late 19th century to come to America, gamers could create a genuine human migration, away from the real and into the virtual. What will be real then? The specific object of Castronova's scholarship is Mmorpgs, the inelegant acronym for \"massively multiplayer online role-playing games,\" which can involve hundreds of thousands of players plugging in from all over the world. A disproportionate number of these games revolve around dwarfs, wizards, quests and magic lands, though the content is becoming ever more diverse. These days, there's a Mmorpg out there to suit the interests of just about anybody. One game, The Sims Online, merely simulates suburban life, and it is madly popular. Castronova is an economist who teaches telecommunications at Indiana University, and among academic economists he is a bold contrarian, if only because he dares to take computer games seriously. My oh my does he take them seriously. In dense, lifeless prose, he sledgehammers away at his major themes, constantly pausing to review the material he's just covered and preview what is to come. His sweeping conclusions are intriguing -- get ready for governments sending agents into virtual worlds and waging war with avatars! -- but he's not a vivid enough writer to animate most of his futuristic abstractions. In \"Smartbomb,\" Heather Chaplin and Aaron Ruby try harder to entertain. They've organized their history of video games as a study of ambitious individuals, breaking it down into a series of breezy, magazinelike profiles of uneven quality. A lot of the original reporting seems to take place at gaming conventions, which is not where one imagines the really interesting stuff happens. But the stories are pretty good, even when they don't break new ground. Rereading the legend of Nolan Bushnell and the founding of Atari is like hearing a bar band play a spirited \"Twist and Shout\" -- enjoyable, but no additional points for Degree of Difficulty. In two spots, though, Chaplin and Ruby really score. In their chapter on Mmorpgs, they sensitively profile David Reber, a 30-year-old Californian who spends every free moment chained to his computer, acting out a series of intense fantasy existences that provide him with the companionship and sense of achievement missing in his real life. Just as Castronova would predict, Reber withdraws from the real world as his fantasy life deepens -- he has lapses at work and when Chaplin and Ruby last check in with him, he's moved back in with his mother. The other winning portrait in \"Smartbomb\" is of Will Wright, the creator of SimCity, as well as its offshoot The Sims, and a new simulation called Spore in which players guide a new creature from its biological origin onward. In an industry that mimics Hollywood's craven predilection for cheap, gory theatrics, Wright stands apart as a humble philosopher in love with the potential of games to expand the human experience. Though Chaplin and Ruby don't have much to say themselves about the significance of video games, they wisely hand matters over to Wright, who foresees a future that might just keep us all staying up past 2 a.m. \"I think one thing that's unique about video games is not only that they can respond to you but down the road they'll be able to adapt themselves to you. They'll learn your desires,\" he says. \"It might just be that games become deeply personal artifacts -- more like dreams.\" Video Game Books Hugo Lindgren is the editorial director of New York Magazine."

                "THE great thing about shopping for video games is that the person you're buying the gift for almost certainly knows more about it than you do. If you have gamers in your life, no matter what age, odds are that they already know exactly what they want. You need only shut up and fork over the credit card. You can use this to your advantage. If you are lucky enough that the gamer on your list has said anything recently about a game or game machine that is not Microsoft's new Xbox 360, the smart move is to drop whatever you're doing right now and buy it. That way, you will not be among the hordes this holiday season already wondering if they can afford to miss a car payment, or maybe a mortgage installment, to satisfy their 360-craving gamer. That is because the 360, with its snazzy graphics and slick online interface, has emerged as the It gift of the 2005 holiday season. Theoretically, the 360 is supposed to cost $300 for a basic unit and $400 for the deluxe version. In reality, the console is sold out across the country and is now fetching $1,000 or so on eBay. And that's before you buy any games, which run up to $60 each. So if your favorite gamer is interested in anything else this year, consider yourself fortunate. Thankfully, forgoing the 360 doesn't mean returning to the Stone Age of, say, Pong. There are still excellent games being made for the current generation of home game consoles -- Sony's PlayStation 2, Nintendo's GameCube, and the original Xbox, which each cost less than $200 -- and Sony's $250 PSP headlines the strong current crop of hand-held units. Moreover, if you have a powerful PC, that may still be your most capable game machine. In any case, both Sony and Nintendo have new game consoles on the way next year. And availability of the 360 is sure to improve in early 2006. There is a chance that Microsoft could show up with a \"surprise\" boatload of additional 360's in the next few weeks. (The word from the company is that it is working as hard as it can to get units to retailers.) Unless you're willing to pay the prices on eBay or other auction sites, the best advice to shoppers who absolutely must have a 360 is to get themselves on waiting lists at as many retailers and Web sites as possible. So those folks you saw camped out on sidewalks before the 360 went on sale on Nov. 22 don't look so silly now, right? Waiting in line for a midnight sale at a Wal-Mart in Moline, Ill., Kara Harvell told The Quad-City Times that she wanted to buy the console for her five sons. Deliciously, the newspaper reported that Ms. Harvell, a nursing school student, \"got out of class by telling her professor that her son wasn't feeling well at school.\" Of course, some people don't like waiting in line. In the (very) few days before the machine sold out, scattered reports emerged of shoppers being held up for their 360's as they left stores. Please don't go robbing anyone. But if you've already gone through the effort of finding a 360 at its regular price, it is certainly worth the extra $100 for the higher-end model. The full version comes with a headset (for making free phone calls over the Internet to other Xbox users), a wireless controller (instead of a wired model) and a hard drive, which you need to play games made for the original Xbox. Top-line games are $50 to $60. The unit comes with a free basic membership to Microsoft's online game service, which lets you talk to other online 360 users and compare scores. But if you want to actually play head-to-head live over the Internet, you need to buy the \"gold\" membership, which costs $8 a month or $50 a year. In addition to playing games with eye-popping graphics, the machine plays DVD's and can display photos from your digital camera on your regular or high-definition television. Luckily, the 360 is not the only game system potentially worth buying this holiday season. There are cheaper and more readily available options, too. Besides the Xbox 360, the other major new game machine is Sony's PSP hand-held. The sleek black unit has a clear, colorful screen that is far more vibrant than one would expect from a hand-held device, and that may be why people on buses and trains seem to be using their PSP's to watch movies as much as playing games. Dozens of movies are now being released on the small UMD data discs that slip into the back of the PSP, which inexplicably comes with white headphones reminiscent of those supplied with Apple's iPods. Over all, the games for the PSP have been lackluster so far, but that trend shows signs of changing. Aimed at adults, the new Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories takes advantage of the PSP's built-in wireless capability to allow multiple PSP users to battle one another through the game's streets and alleys, even as the players themselves are on the go. Next year, a new installment of the quirky family-friendly Japanese game Katamari Damacy is expected for the PSP. Even cheaper and smaller than the PSP is Nintendo's DS hand-held, which costs about $130. Nintendo has long been popular with young gamers, but the new Nintendogs pet simulator is finding fans among both children and adult women. The screens on the DS, which stands for dual screen, are not quite as impressive as the PSP's, but are still clear enough for enjoyable gaming. But rather than play on the go, many people still prefer their video games on the television in the den. With all of the hype around the 360 it is easy to overlook that you can now buy the original Xbox or Sony's PlayStation 2 each for around $150. Bundles that include a console and a few games can be found under $300 on the Web. Nintendo's GameCube console now costs only around $100. Of course, the Xbox, GameCube and PS2 certainly don't have the cachet of the new 360. And most serious gamers already have one, two or even all three of the older systems. But if you are looking for a cost-effective way to introduce a young person to gaming, buying any of the older systems is a smart move. In fact, many serious gamers would argue that the games being made now for those mature machines are actually better than those for the 360, which is still so new that developers have not yet figured out how to fully harness its power. The older games just don't look quite as snazzy. But until Sony's PlayStation 3 and Nintendo's Revolution are released next year, the Xbox 360 is clearly the best gaming machine around (unless you want to consider a top-notch gaming PC, which could easily cost more than $2,000). If someone you know wants a 360 and you can't find it at a reasonable price, perhaps fend them off with a PSP or a gift certificate that can be exchanged for some new games for an existing console. Then promise you'll get a 360, PlayStation 3 or Revolution next year. You may forget the promise, but they won't. Is It Live, or Is It A Video Game? THERE are about 20 games available for Microsoft's new Xbox 360. It does not have a single hit title yet, as Halo became for the original Xbox, and the lineup is still missing some genres, like role-playing games. Nonetheless, games out now do a good job of demonstrating how the next generation of consoles deliver visual and social experiences far more sophisticated than those possible on older consoles. The strongest two genres on the 360 are auto racing and first-person shooters. On the racetrack, Project Gotham Racing 3 lets you speed through detailed recreated cities like New York, Las Vegas and London. You can race in online leagues, compete against \"ghosts\" that simulate your friends' best performances or \"tune in\" and watch from the sidelines as some of the best virtual drivers in the world go wheel to wheel. The shooters put a player in the perspective of a person fighting, often with guns. Among the standouts are Perfect Dark Zero, set in the near future, and Call of Duty 2, a gritty re-creation of World War II. The most visually impressive 360 game is Kameo: Elements of Power, an action adventure that looks like child's play, with its evocation of a Pixar animated film, but is challenging at points. About half the games for the 360 mimic real-life sports. NBA 2K6, which at times could pass for a live telecast, is the most impressive of the bunch. Amped 3, a snowboarding simulator, is easy to play and gorgeous to watch. SETH SCHIESEL"

                "Tomorrow the Xbox, the new video-game console from Microsoft, arrives in stores on the heels of a $500 million marketing blitz. But it doesn't seem as if much of that money is going to the thousands of musicians who have provided the company with songs to use in the games that will be played on it. Though a band can typically make $10,000 to $20,000 when a song is included in a video game, Microsoft has been asking musicians to contribute their music to video games for pennies -- and in some cases no money at all, with no upfront fee and no royalties on the back end. Musicians, from small, independent punk bands to major-label artists, have been accepting this deal, hoping for the promotional boost that comes with being heard in a game that is played obsessively by teenagers across the country. Joining a band is not a lucrative career choice for most musicians. Many who are signed to major labels spend their careers in debt to those record companies, trying to earn back advances and expenses. But the increasing use of contemporary songs in movies, video games and advertisements has meant an unexpected windfall for lesser-known and midlevel artists. Microsoft, however, is changing that dynamic. ''I asked if we could get any money, and they just said no,'' said Larry Cooper, who runs Revelation Records, a punk, metal and hardcore label that has several songs on the soundtrack to Amped, a snowboarding game. ''I almost thought that out of principle, if there's no payment, we shouldn't do that kind of stuff. But I didn't want to snip out an opportunity for a band that might want to do that kind of promotion.'' Of the bands Mr. Cooper asked, all but one agreed to provide free music to Microsoft. ''I think they were just looking for cheap music, and that's why they called a lot of small labels,'' Mr. Cooper continued. ''I asked them who else was on the soundtrack and made some suggestions, but they said they wanted to stick with certain labels because they didn't have to pay for licensing.'' Brenner Adams, a product planner on Amped, said that on his game Microsoft was looking not for cheap music but for an opportunity to expose as many small underground bands as possible. Under Microsoft policy the interview with Mr. Adams was conducted with a company publicist on the line, taking notes on the conversation. ''We're not saying, 'Hey, we want to use your music for nothing,' '' Mr. Adams said. ''We said, 'Hey, we really want to promote these artists and promote who they are and what they stand for.' '' Though Microsoft didn't give any money to musicians on such independent labels, it did offer small amounts to bands on major labels. It made a deal with Virgin Records, obtaining songs from acts like the Gorillaz, Iggy Pop, the Chemical Brothers and Timbaland & Magoo by paying ''small fees and publishing,'' said Brad Fox, the director of artist development at Virgin. The amount of course remains a big contrast to the millions of dollars that Microsoft is believed to have paid to use Madonna's ''Ray of Light'' in its 60-second Windows XP advertisement. ''We're looking at this as a marketing exercise,'' Mr. Fox said. ''There's no way I could get 10 to 15 different artists in somebody's house in front of an active consumer audience for 20 hours a week. If I could get 20 percent of those kids to go buy a record, that's great.'' But the Xbox isn't like other systems, nor are these deals like other deals. Many record labels are operating on the faith that Microsoft will make efforts to promote their bands. Mr. Fox said he hoped that the Virgin artists used in the games would be mentioned in Xbox promotional material, game catalogs and game boxes. But a trip to the Xbox Web site showed that the artists on games like Amped were not mentioned on the box or promotional poster shown online, nor were the bands on any game highlighted in any special way on the Web site. Other promotional efforts, however, have been made: there was a link at the site to a radio station playing music from Amped, and at a recent Xbox promotional party in Los Angeles Microsoft gave away a CD with music from Amped. Mr. Adams noted that most of the cash deals were made with better-known bands that don't need the publicity as much. ''So,'' he said, ''why not turn the decision around, bring the smaller guys up and give them the promotion they can't get anywhere else?'' He said that music from some 240 artists was used on Amped, that in the game the names of the record labels are shown on banners and that players had the option of seeing names of the bands, songs and record labels. He added that the company hoped to stage more promotions with the music. But there is no guarantee that gamers will hear much if any of the music of these bands. That is because in a feature unique to the Xbox consumers have the option of wiping out the soundtrack to a game and replacing it with music from their own CD's. Originally music executives were less worried about artists not getting paid than about the potential for Xbox to become a new Napster, since it has a large hard drive and online capabilities. But in a statement prepared for this article Microsoft said that though music could be stored on the hard drive, it could not be copied on ''CD's, MP3's or any other devices.'' Other executives in the music publishing business now worry that video game manufacturers and even advertising agencies will follow Microsoft's lead and tell bands that in exchange for use of their music at no cost, an extra effort will be made to promote the groups in products and commercials. As it is, artists sacrifice a lot of money and time at the altar of promotion, taking on costly and inconvenient tasks gratis, like performing concerts promoted by radio stations. So, some wonder, in a field in which just about anything musicians do can be seen as raising their profiles, where is the line between promotional and paid work? Jeff Koz, the chief executive of SubZero, a company that brokers deals between advertisers and musicians, said, ''We believe that people should be paid for what they do.'' Mr. Koz has worked with Microsoft on music and sound design. He added, however, that there was a give-and-take between payment and promotion, and lesser-known artists were often given somewhat lower fees in exchange for what could be career-enhancing exposure. ''There's value to cross-promotion,'' he said, ''and we're not privy to how those Microsoft deals went down. Some of those bands might see it as a tremendous opportunity.'' No. 1 and Dropping The new Britney Spears album, ''Britney,'' will enter the pop charts next week at No. 1 with 769,000 copies sold, according to Soundscan, a company that tracks retail sales. The number, a significant drop from the first-week sales of her previous album (1.3 million), reflects a teenage pop demand that is slipping but still hanging on tenaciously as Ms. Spears sagely remakes her image so she has one foot in the teenage world and the other in the general pop market (an approach best summed up by her song title ''I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman''). The following week, record executives say, ''Britney'' seems likely to slip to No. 2 when the Garth Brooks album ''Scarecrow'' makes its debut with predicted sales of more than one million copies."

                "LOS ANGELES — Microsoft, seeking to expand offerings on its Xbox 360 console, has reached an agreement with a company headed by Peter Safran, the veteran Hollywood producer and talent manager, to produce original shows for distribution on the system. Through his Safran Co., he represents clients like the actor and producer Sean Combs (\"Monster's Ball\"), the actor and writer Nia Vardalos (\"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\") and the filmmakers Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer (\"Epic Movie\"). Safran founded the company in 2006 after leaving Brillstein-Grey Management. Speaking by telephone last week, Scott Nocas, global marketing manager for programming of the Xbox Live entertainment service, said he expected similar deals to follow. \"We definitely look at this as the first of many,\" said Nocas. In an interview at his office in Los Angeles last week, Safran said his first round of programs would be scripted and would probably run under 10 minutes. He said his initial focus would be on genres like comedy and horror that appeal to the Xbox 360 audience, which is heavily concentrated from the ages of 14 to 34, and tends to be more male than female. The first shows are expected to be available to viewers by autumn in the Northern Hemisphere. \"The Xbox is unique; it operates at a level outside of what we generally consider Web entertainment,\" Safran said, referring to the system's tight demographic base, which is defined by the appeal of signature games like the Halo series. The new shows will be available exclusively via the Xbox 360 for a time, then may appear elsewhere, Safran said."

                "Looking for an advantage in the next round of the video-console wars, Microsoft has made the first move. Three and a half years after it entered the console market with the Xbox, Microsoft yesterday unveiled its successor, the Xbox 360, a creamy white console that is to go on sale in North America, Europe and Japan by the holiday season. Though noticeably smaller than its squat black predecessor, the console houses three 3.2-gigahertz I.B.M. microprocessors that could qualify it as the most powerful home computer on the market. Indeed, unlike the original Xbox, the new console can act as a home entertainment hub, streaming pictures, music and video from digital cameras, portable music players and computers that run Microsoft Windows XP. Most evidently different, Xbox 360, which Microsoft introduced last night in a 30-minute presentation on MTV, is designed to display games in wide-screen, high-definition format as well as in standard definition. Microsoft's move, after years of secrecy, rumors and fragmentary disclosures, comes as its competitors -- Sony, the undisputed industry leader, and Nintendo, a close third worldwide -- are also preparing presentations of their coming consoles for the Electronic Entertainment Expo, a major industry trade show, in Los Angeles next week. Representatives of those companies said their game systems, Sony's PlayStation 3 and Nintendo's, which is code-named Revolution, are set for release next year. For the game industry, with $10 billion a year in sales in the United States alone, the consoles' arrivals will not only give rise to new demand for game hardware but will set off a new wave of game development and purchases. As the consoles put new emphasis on high-definition video, they may stimulate TV sales as well. One analyst, describing the anticipation surrounding the announcements, said it was as if Detroit released a new line of automobiles only once every four or five years. \"The business is getting bigger, the stakes are getting higher, and there is such a big leap in technology, potentially making the games ever more realistic and involving,\" said Anita Frazier, entertainment industry analyst for NPD Funworld. Microsoft did not disclose the pricing of its new console. Since their introductions, the current Xbox and Sony's PlayStation 2 have dropped in price from $300 to $150 in the United States; Nintendo's GameCube, originally $200, is now $100. When Xbox arrived in 2001, it was heralded as the most powerful of the consoles and had innovations including a built-in hard drive and an Ethernet port for online play. The machine's biggest hits have been the Halo games, published by Microsoft itself; Halo 2, released last fall, has sold 6.3 million copies. Xbox has also developed a following among game developers, who have been drawn to its power. Still, even with 20 million consoles sold, Xbox has been far outdistanced by Sony's PlayStation 2, with sales of 80 million and 70 percent of the world market. While Halo 2's success put Microsoft's games unit in the black for one quarter last year, the Xbox effort has yet to provide sustained profitability. \"Xbox 1 was very much ready, fire, aim,\" said J Allard, corporate vice president at Microsoft and a leading architect of the Xbox effort. \"We had 19 months and a day between the day we approved the project to the day we were on store shelves.\" For the new Xbox project, Mr. Allard said his team had twice that time and aimed at conceiving a \"magical product\" that was so well integrated it would seem the creation of a single mind. In sheer computing power, the new Xbox is capable of a trillion calculations per second, many orders of magnitude above the original Xbox. (The current box depends mainly on a 733-megahertz processor.) The heat generated by all that power will be drawn off by a water-based cooling system, something usually seen only in high-end PC's. It will also include a redesigned wireless game controller. A Web camera, code-named Cyclops, and a TV-like remote control will be optional. Peter Moore, a Microsoft corporate vice president for worldwide sales and marketing, said Xbox 360 would be especially suited for wide-screen high-definition television and Digital Dolby 5.1 multichannel sound, a requirement for all Xbox 360 games. He added that the new console would also be more seamlessly integrated with Xbox Live, the service that connects games and gamers over high-speed Internet connections for multiplayer action. Xbox Live, which has 1.4 million subscribers, will include a new tier that waives the $6 monthly fee. A demonstration of the console's power delivered stunningly realistic scenes that were indistinguishable at some points from live-action video. \"We have to continue to feed that core audience,\" Robert J. Bach, senior vice president and chief Xbox officer at Microsoft, said of the most ardent gamers. \"But part of the challenge of this next generation is how do we cultivate a broader mass audience.\" Part of that strategy, he said, includes designing Xbox 360 to perform a range of nongaming functions suited to the living room, like streaming digital music and pictures, or videoconferencing. In addition to playing DVD's, as the current Xbox does, it can rip songs from CD's onto a 20-gigabyte hard drive -- a hard drive that can be removed, upgraded and interchanged with other 360 consoles. Judging by dozens of Web sites dedicated to interest in next-generation consoles, expectations are soaring that Xbox 360's competitors will also provide vastly improved graphics, sound and game playing. For example, it is widely believed that Sony's PlayStation 3, which will use a new cell processor technology, will be the most powerful. Molly Smith, a Sony spokeswoman, would not discuss hardware specifics of the PlayStation 3. But she did say that it would be able to deliver \"a quantum leap\" in gaming and electronic entertainment. Nintendo, struggling to shed an image that its technologies mostly appeal to children, is preparing to deliver a game console that is radically different from the cute and cuddly GameCube. Perrin Kaplan, Nintendo's vice president for corporate affairs, said GameCube's successor would be \"very, very sleek.\" She described it as horizontal and no taller than a stack of three DVD cases. Unlike GameCube, the new system will play DVD's, Ms. Kaplin said, and will feature a wireless controller. It will play GameCube games as well as a new class of high-definition games, with new emphasis on online play. Microsoft would not say whether games for the current Xbox would play on Xbox 360. Some industry analysts and game developers said it was likely that games for all three consoles would increase to $60 or $65; the typical price for premium titles on the current machines is $50. \"Over all, the introduction of the next-generation systems will have a very positive impact on the video game industry,\" said Will Kassoy, vice president for global brand management at Activision, a game publisher. \"They will expand the user base and grow software sales.\" Historically, he said, each new cycle of consoles has ushered in a 30 percent rise in the number of players. \"We believe this next generation will see similar growth,\" Mr. Kassoy said. Activision is scheduled to have four games for Xbox 360 at the start, including some of the company's best-selling series -- Tony Hawk, Call to Duty and Quake. Simon Jeffery, president of Sega, said his company would have two titles for Xbox 360 for the holiday season -- Condemned: Criminal Origins and Full Auto -- emphasizing that they will take advantage of the new console's increased power. \"Every successive jump in technology affords new elements of games,\" he said. \"We now will have processing power to do things we haven't been able to do before.\""

                "Sending voice and Webcam picture messages to fellow Xbox 360 players over Microsoft’s Xbox Live service is a cinch, but tapping out old-fashioned text messages using the 360’s onscreen keyboard isn’t much fun. A new $30 miniature keyboard called the Chatpad speeds up text entry to let you best even the fastest BlackBerry touch-typists.  The Chatpad, to go on sale Sept. 6, attaches to the underside of the 360’s controller without interfering with the controller’s comfortable feel in the hands. A backlight makes typing during late-night Gears of War campaigns easier on the eyes, and a dedicated Messenger button activates the 360’s instant messaging program so you can taunt your enemies without breaking from the action. Unfortunately you can’t use the keyboard to type a letter and jump to the corresponding spot in long lists of Xbox Live movie downloads or songs stored on an iPod connected to the 360. Instead, you need to hold down the scroll button. Albert Penello, director for global marketing for Xbox, said the company was looking into a way to add this feature. "

                "FORGET horsepower, forget miles per gallon: the key metric for judging the Nissan Urge, a design study to be introduced today at the North American International Automobile Show in Detroit, is polygons per second, an index of performance for video games. Five hundred million polygons a second is the rating for the Microsoft Xbox 360 video game system tucked away in the car's trunk. It pumps out images fast enough to generate dizzyingly sharp scenes of city streets and speeding cars on a display that folds down from above the windshield. The Urge's key trick is that when parked, its steering wheel and pedals can be used to control the Xbox. The game's soundtrack of roaring engines and screeching tires play through the car's speakers to accompany the action on the screen. Many cars have had video game displays installed in their dashboards. The Urge is the first car to be turned into a game controller -- the tail is now wagging the dog. The Urge, created at Nissan Design America in the La Jolla section of San Diego, is another of the auto industry's seemingly endless quests for \"echo boomer\" customers, a coterie that for carmakers gleams over the horizon the way the mythical city of Eldorado did for the conquistadors. In part, the Urge is a response to an online survey, said John Cupit, a design manager for Nissan. Mr. Cupit interpreted the survey results in the bare, exposed look of the Urge, an articulation of the car's parts aimed, he said, at giving the feel of a motorcycle. The fenders and structure, mostly aluminum, stand out as separate parts. The engine -- a piece of the car so unimportant in this case that Nissan did not even provide the usual specifications of horsepower and torque -- is visible beneath a transparent hood. Nissan calls the look \"minimalism to the maximum.\" The bottoms of the doors are cut away, revealing a surrounding frame of aluminum rendered in \"acid yellow,\" which Anka Mazzei, the color designer, said she chose to express intensity and speed. The front end of the Urge is similar to the GT-R Proto, a concept that Nissan unveiled at the Tokyo auto show last fall. But one should not take the exterior of the Urge too literally. Its weirdness signals that it is unlikely to become a production vehicle. What counts is the concept. Urge is an implicit response to cultural change: young buyers have proved more fascinated by the innovations of their new cellphones, hand-held devices and video games than by the automotive advances that captivated their parents. The showcase game for the Xbox 360 is a special edition of Project Gotham Racing, one of the hit titles for the original Xbox as well. Mr. Cupit said that he and his colleagues at the La Jolla studio spend a lot of time playing on a huge plasma screen. The project was a joint effort with Microsoft, so the Xbox 360 beneath the boattail- shape trunk, one of a half-million consoles shipped since the game system went on sale Nov. 22, is different from the others: no one stood in line to buy it. Video gaming is not the only technology incorporated into the Urge. In addition to the Xbox 360, there is an iPod docking station and a cellphone that doubles as a \"smart key\" to start the engine. In at least one respect, the Urge might be the perfect car: it burns no gasoline while parked for game playing; it generates no emissions; it lines up in no traffic jams. It can virtually roll through the streets of Las Vegas or spin around the Nürburgring. Its version of Gotham Racing can even run uptown on the parts of Broadway that are one-way heading downtown, a special thrill for Manhattan drivers. With a wireless connection, in theory, two Urges could be parked side-by-side for competition like the old racing games at the arcade in Atlantic City. Thanks to the Internet, the same thing could be done even if the Urges were half a world apart. The game encourages stylish driving. Good driving through the curves earns the driver style points, called Kudos, that can be redeemed for a better vehicle. According to the Microsoft programmers, power sliding, pulling off a 360-degree spin, getting air time, drafting and getting up on two wheels \"will earn gamers Kudos points for their style and skill.\" Too bad the real automotive world doesn't work this way. Each car in the game is made up of 80,000 polygons and takes eight days of programming by its creators, who are holed up in the London studio of Bizarre Creations. Real-world details include gauges that move and realistic bug-smash streaks on the windshield. Oddly, the Urge itself is not among the cars you can drive on the screen. That will probably be remedied soon. Project Gotham players and programmers regularly produce new cars that can be downloaded. The Urge's notion of car-as-video game is not unprecedented. A similar concept, the Scion Speedster -- a red Scion xA show car built by 5 Axis Productions in Huntington Beach, Calif. -- was displayed at the Specialty Equipment Market Association trade show in Las Vegas last fall. The Speedster also has an open panel in the doors -- and two Xboxes running the Forza racing game onboard. The two cars simply evolved at the same time, Mr. Cupit said. He prefers his version of the idea. \"We tried to take seriously designing the door glass to protect the occupants from wind and rain, and also vehicle ingress-egress,\" he said. \"Our door moves up and down to ease entry into the car, for example.\" \"We often visit tuner and customizing shows to see what young people are thinking about,\" Mr. Cupit said. \"The Urge helps reinvent the sports car for the next generation of young people.\" Observing young people at auto shows, it is impossible not to note that they pay more attention to how their cars look and sound than how fast they go. The investment tends to go into electronics and colorful bolt-on parts, rather than into making the engine run faster and more furious. Maybe more automakers should put Xboxes in their cars. General Motors and Ford might stir up interest by tucking Xbox 360's into all their trunks."

                "REDMOND, Wash. — Microsoft is betting it has a new way to win the wallets of consumers. The company on Tuesday introduced the new version of its Xbox video game console. The Xbox has been one of Microsoft’s few undeniable consumer hits of the last decade, a product that was not just a credible entry into the games business but also a sign of the innovation possible at a company that is rarely seen as an inventive thinker. “I think of Xbox as the accidental success out of Microsoft,” said James McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester Research, who added that the connection Microsoft has formed with the players of its current Xbox is “much deeper than any relationship Microsoft has ever achieved before.”  The new console, the Xbox One, will enter a market very different from the one its predecessor, the Xbox 360, entered nearly eight years ago, when there was no iPad, smartphones had keyboards and mobile gaming devices were primitive at best.  Today, video games can be played almost anywhere, on any device, with the biggest possible audience of online friends and without the aid of a costly gaming console. The last year or two has been bumpy for Microsoft’s consumer efforts. The Windows 8 operating system software and the Surface tablet-computing devices got a tepid reception from the public when they went on sale last fall.  The company’s mobile phone efforts have been largely ignored. And even Bing, Microsoft’s Internet search engine, has failed to close a wide gap with Google, the market leader.  Microsoft, though, could see better results with the Xbox. With it, it hopes it can reassert the living room as the place where people can still get the best gaming experience, complete with eye-popping graphics and innovative methods for controlling games. It is also a place where Microsoft’s technology can be at the center of a home entertainment system and the funnel through which people gain access to online video. Microsoft has sold more than 76 million of the device’s current incarnation, the Xbox 360 worldwide, compared with almost 100 million Wii consoles from Nintendo and more than 70 million PlayStation 3s from Sony.  The company also controls what may be the most valuable asset in console gaming, Xbox Live, a subscription-based online service with 48 million members who use it to play games against one another and watch movies.  “You can do a lot of things on the phone and a lot of things on tablets,” said John Taylor, an analyst at Arcadia Investment. But, he said, “you can’t do the same kinds of things on those devices” that you can on a television screen. Microsoft plans to develop its own original, live-action television series, which will be accessible through the Xbox. The series will be made in partnership with the director Steven Spielberg and will be based on the popular Halo video game franchise.  The company is also working with the National Football League to develop an app for Xbox that lets players interact with their fantasy football teams while watching a live game. In an interview, Don A. Mattrick, the president of Microsoft’s interactive entertainment business, said that he recognized the growing appeal of mobile devices for gaming and that Microsoft would aggressively tie smartphones and tablets into the experience of using its console. He became most animated when talking about the possibilities of the new Xbox for providers of video programming. “We’re going to the take the form from a one-way experience pushed through a straw to where you can communicate back and make it interactive,” Mr. Mattrick said.  Even if it is a wild success, the new Xbox is likely to have a bigger impact on consumer perception than it will on Microsoft’s overall sales. The Xbox remains a small slice of the company’s business, which is still dominated by sales of Windows, Office and other software. The company’s games division represented only 4 percent of its operating profit. At an event in a carnival tent on its corporate campus, Microsoft did not say how much the new system would cost or how publishing partners would charge for games, which typically start at around $60 for high-end game consoles.  A major feature of the new Xbox, which is expected to hit store shelves in time for the holiday season, will be a new generation of Kinect, the camera-based motion-control sensor introduced several years ago as an Xbox 360 accessory. The new Kinect will come with every Xbox One. Traditional retail sales of games have come under pressure in recent years as mobile devices like the iPhone and iPad have invaded their turf with free and low-cost games. While many gamers dismiss those offerings as inferior to console games, the games have nevertheless tapped into a huge audience of players who may never have played on an Xbox or Sony’s PlayStation. The games business could use a jolt. Total United States retail sales of game hardware and software fell 25 percent to $495.2 million in April from $657.5 million a year earlier, according to estimates by NPD Group, a research firm. That figure does not include the sale of downloadable content over the Internet. Alex St. John, an entrepreneur who worked on Microsoft’s pre-Xbox game efforts, says he is pessimistic about prospects for gaming consoles. “They’re coming out with the latest and greatest stone tool,” Mr. St. John said. “The new console that trumps the old console is called the Apple iPad. This generation of kids loves mobile games.”"

                "Three months after surprising the video game industry with strong sales of its first console, the Microsoft Corporation will dispatch its chairman, Bill Gates, to Tokyo this week to introduce its assault on an inhospitable Japanese market. Not since the industry's early days, when Atari competed for space in video arcades, has a major American game company tried to dethrone Japanese hardware makers on their own turf. When it begins selling its Xbox game system in Japan on Friday, Microsoft will try to use the star power of Mr. Gates and a lineup of specialized games to battle the leaders, Sony and Nintendo. Many industry insiders predict that the Xbox, which has sold more than 1.5 million units in North America since November, will face tough going in Japan, where American software companies have found tremendous difficulties merely putting their games onto store shelves. ''You are talking about a closed market and going up against two very strong, very entrenched competitors,'' said Heath A. Terry, a game software analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston. ''For Microsoft to expect significant success early on in that market is unrealistic.'' The Xbox has other strikes against it for Japanese consumers, who buy about a third of the world's game products. Analysts worry that the console is too big for the living room in a country where smaller gadgets rule. And at about $260, the Xbox costs $40 more than Sony's PlayStation2 and $75 more than Nintendo's GameCube. Yet analysts and software makers acknowledge that Microsoft, the world's No. 1 software company, managed the North American rollout of the Xbox better than they had expected. They also noted that it has deep pockets and has shown unflagging persistence in entering other businesses. The company has already made one significant adjustment specifically for Japan: after criticism from early testers, it built smaller game controllers, with buttons closer together, to better fit the hands of the average Japanese player. Peter Moore, president and chief operating officer for Sega of America, the American division of the Japanese games publisher, said Microsoft's early success in North America gave the company a fighting chance in Japan and Europe, where the Xbox goes on sale on March 14. ''It's eerily reminiscent of the power of the launch of the PlayStation,'' he said, referring to Sony's first console. ''The way a powerful global company can attack an industry, get under its skin and change an industry.'' Hirohisa Ohura, who runs Microsoft's Xbox division in Japan, said the North American introduction had proved that the company could compete in the video game business. While calling Japan ''the most challenging market'' for the Xbox, he said Microsoft would keep chipping away at its competitors for the loyalty of Japanese game players. ''U.S. companies coming into Japan as a game vendor tended to fail and walk away real quick,'' Mr. Ohura said. ''We're not willing to give up at any point. Once we're in this business, we're in here to win.'' In its quest for the buzz that makes or breaks video games, Microsoft set up hundreds of Xbox kiosks in Tokyo and Osaka earlier this month. And for the introduction on Friday, Mr. Gates himself will stump for the Xbox at an event similar to his appearance last November at the opening of the Toys ''R'' Us store in Times Square. Microsoft began taking advance orders on Feb. 2 for consoles, including 50,000 special edition systems with a translucent case and a silver-plated key chain engraved with the autograph of Mr. Gates -- an accessory that has been mocked on online message boards and game publications. Sony, the consumer electronics giant, has an enormous head start on Microsoft. By Dec. 31, Sony said, it had shipped 25 million of its next-generation consoles, the PlayStation2, including 10 million to North America and 8 million to Japan. ''The burden isn't on our company to compete with them; the burden is significantly on Microsoft to compete with us,'' said Molly Smith, a spokeswoman for Sony Computer Entertainment America, the company's American division. The list of best-selling software is dominated by titles that run on the PlayStation2. Yet while they have capitalized on Sony's success in North America, large American game publishers have found the Japanese market difficult to penetrate and have been forced to cooperate with Japanese publishers to develop games specifically for Japan and have games sold there. Electronic Arts is the No. 1 publisher of PlayStation2 titles in North America, but only No. 7 in Japan. ''The secret in Japan is getting product that's culturally appealing to Japanese consumers,'' said Stan McKee, chief financial officer of Electronic Arts. Microsoft has forged partnerships of its own with more than 90 Japanese publishers, but still faces an uphill battle. Because of Sony's lead, analysts said, Microsoft will consider its introduction a success if it wins close to 20 percent of the Japanese market."

                "Reaching out to millions of aspiring game developers around the world, Microsoft plans today to announce a contest that will award $10,000 and the opportunity to entice millions of eyeballs to the next great digital diversion for the company’s Xbox 360. In addition to the game console’s snazzy graphics, the Xbox Live online service has been the most important component of the Xbox 360’s success since its debut in 2005. And perhaps the most popular aspect of Xbox Live has been the service’s arcade component, which allows users to download and play smaller, relatively simpler games like Uno and Geometry Wars that usually cost less than $10. (By contrast, top-end games can sell in stores for around $60.) The popularity of Xbox Live Arcade has in turn attracted the attention of game developers looking to create the next Tetris or Minesweeper. Late last year, Microsoft introduced a suite of software tools for making so-called casual games called XNA.  And so at a game makers’ convention in San Francisco, Microsoft plans to announce a contest akin to the television show “Project Greenlight” that will award a cash prize and a potential slot on Xbox Live Arcade to the best new game created with XNA tools. The company intends to announce the winner of the contest, called “Dream-Build-Play,” in August.  “This competition highlights the power of XNA and the popularity of the Xbox Live Arcade service with its millions of users,” Aaron Greenberg, Microsoft’s group product manager for the Xbox 360 and Xbox Live, said in a telephone interview.  To help increase the popularity of casual games, Microsoft will also announce the introduction of a new 512-megabyte portable storage device for the Xbox 360. The previous portable storage unit contained only 64 megabytes of data, and so Xbox Live Arcade games had been limited to an official size of 50 megabytes. With the new unit, Microsoft will also raise the official size limit on Xbox Live Arcade games to 150 megabytes, allowing enhanced graphics, sound and artificial intelligence. SETH SCHIESEL"

                "Raising the ante in the video game wars, Microsoft is bringing out a new version of the Xbox 360 game machine that has a bigger hard drive, better high-definition video support and a stylish black finish, not an insignificant feature in a world where looking cool ranks high. The idea is to appeal to an elite class of hardcore game players who would like a little more of everything.   “Today’s games-and-entertainment enthusiast has an insatiable appetite for digital high-definition content,” said Peter Moore, corporate vice president for Microsoft’s interactive entertainment business, in Redmond, Wash.   The Xbox 360 Elite, which is to be announced today and will be in stores in late April, will have a list price of $479, or $80 more than the Xbox 360 Pro and $180 more than the basic Xbox 360. The new model has a 120-gigabyte hard drive, in contrast to the standard model’s 20-gigabyte drive. It also has a high-definition multimedia interface port and cable and a wireless controller and headset. Current Xbox 360 owners can buy the new 120-gigabyte hard drive as a separate accessory for $179.  Microsoft is clearly hoping to fill what it sees as a hole at the top end of the market. The Nintendo Wii has been outselling the PlayStation 3 from Sony and the Xbox 360 in recent months, but that system is largely positioned as a family-friendly game machine that can be purchased for $50 less than the lowest-priced Xbox. The Sony system is priced higher than both the Nintendo and the Microsoft systems, with the cheapest model priced at $499.  Both Microsoft and Sony have positioned their consoles as entertainment hubs, not just for playing sophisticated video games but also for listening to music and viewing downloaded movies and television shows.   John Rodman, group product manager for the Xbox platform and Xbox Live, pointed to a recent Microsoft survey that revealed that nearly 40 percent of the time that Xbox 360 users spent with their consoles was for activities other than gaming.   Yet when it comes to gaming, Xbox 360 users are serious, Mr. Rodman says. Six out of 10 Xbox 360 users use Xbox Live, Microsoft’s online gaming service.   “We don’t feel like the Wii customer and the Xbox customer are the same thing,” he said. “We think that as soon as the Wii customer turns 14 they want something else.”  James L. McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester Research, said that Microsoft hoped to encourage customers to spend more money downloading movies and games, which require considerable hard-drive space. "

                "LOS ANGELES  Reaching out beyond hardcore video game players to everyday consumers, Microsoft outlined an entertainment strategy on Monday for making the company’s Xbox 360 game console a gateway for movies, television and social networking. In a media presentation on the eve of E3, the video game industry’s biggest North American convention, Microsoft announced new relationships with the social networking giants Facebook and Twitter as well as Sky, the big British satellite television provider that is a unit of the News Corporation.  Microsoft announced that Facebook users would be able to access their profiles and share photos on their television through the Xbox Live network and that Twitter devotees would also be able to post and read messages through the service.  More far-reaching was Microsoft’s new deal with Sky, under which Xbox Live users in Britain will be able to watch live television, including professional soccer, over an Internet version of the Sky service. Not every channel available over satellite will be available over Xbox Live, but the offering will include dozens of stations, Microsoft executives said. Users will be able to watch television in a virtual party room with their friends, discussing the program as they are watching, they said.  Microsoft has long sought a bigger role in home television, going so far in years past as to try to build its own set-top box business. Partnering with Sky represents a back door into the television market. The company has also recognized how Nintendo has expanded the traditional audience for video games with its innovative motion-sensitive controller for the Wii. Microsoft provided the first public demonstration of its futuristic Project Natal, which it hopes will usher in an age of completely controller-free gaming.  Using a sophisticated camera, infrared sensors and voice recognition software, Natal allows users to control a game or other programs, like a virtual painting studio, merely by waving their arms, speaking to the system and moving around. Microsoft did not say when the technology would become available. Microsoft also demonstrated some of its coming big games, including Forza Motorsport 3, the suspense-thriller Alan Wake and a new version of its biggest hit, Halo. Hideo Kojima, the developer behind the Metal Gear series, said that the next major installment in that franchise would be available for Xbox 360, a coup for Microsoft because previous Metal Gear games had been exclusive to Sony game machines."

The Sony system is priced higher than both the Nintendo and the Microsoft systems, with the cheapest model priced at $499. Both Microsoft and Sony have positioned their consoles as entertainment hubs, not just for playing sophisticated video games but also for listening to music and viewing downloaded movies and television shows. John Rodman, group product manager for the Xbox platform and Xbox Live, pointed to a recent Microsoft survey showing that nearly 40 percent of the time Xbox 360 users spent with their consoles was for activities other than gaming. Yet when it comes to gaming, Xbox 360 users are serious, Rodman says. Six out of 10 Xbox 360 users use Xbox Live, Microsoft's online gaming service. \"We don't feel like the Wii customer and the Xbox customer are the same thing,\" he said. \"We think that as soon as the Wii customer turns 14 they want something else.\" James McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester Research, said that Microsoft hoped to encourage customers to spend more money downloading movies and games, which require considerable hard-drive space."

                "Raising the ante in the video game wars, Microsoft is bringing out a new version of the Xbox 360 game machine that has a bigger hard drive, better high-definition video support and a stylish black finish, not an insignificant feature in a world where looking cool ranks high. The idea is to appeal to an elite class of hard-core game players who would like a little more of everything. \"Today's games and entertainment enthusiast has an insatiable appetite for digital high-definition content,\" said Peter Moore, corporate vice president for Microsoft's interactive entertainment business, in Redmond, Washington. The Xbox 360 Elite, which was announced Wednesday and will be in U.S. stores in late April, will have a list price of $479, or $80 more than the Xbox 360 Pro and $180 more than the basic Xbox 360. The new model has a 120-gigabyte hard drive, in contrast to the standard model's 20-gigabyte drive. It also has a high-definition multimedia interface port and cable, and a wireless controller and headset. Current Xbox 360 owners can buy the new 120-gigabyte hard drive as a separate accessory for $179. Microsoft is clearly hoping to fill what it sees as a hole at the top end of the market.

                " NEW YORK — Buyers of the Xbox 360, Microsoft's second-generation video game console, will expect to play big, expensive marquee games like \"Call of Duty 2\" from Activision and \"Madden NFL 06\" by Electronic Arts. But Microsoft is also banking on them to play small arcade-style video games, purchased and downloaded from the Internet. Unlike its competitors, the Sony PlayStation 2 and Nintendo GameCube, the new Xbox, which goes on sale on Nov. 22, can play games on two separate tracks. One is the familiar terrain of big-budget, deeply immersive games that feel more like interactive movies than games. The other is a return to the video game's arcade roots. But the arcade games are not simple, said Greg Canessa, group manager of Xbox Live Arcade, part of the Xbox division.\"Arcade games are really miniature Xbox 360 games,\" he said. The price is somewhat miniaturized as well. To develop the arcade games cost $100,000 to $200,000, compared with $15 million to $20 million for the larger games. The arcade games will be sold only online, downloadable through the Xbox's broadband-only Internet connection. Microsoft has not officially announced prices for the games, but it is widely expected that they will cost $5 to $10. By contrast, new Xbox games sold at retailers like Best Buy are likely to cost $60, or about $10 more than previous Xbox games, according to some game publishers. The new machines, slimmer and more powerful than the original Xbox released in 2001, will cost $300 for a basic model and $400 for a model with a 20-gigabyte hard drive. They will also be able to play DVDs, CDs and standard music files, including MP3 and Windows Media Audio files, as well as display digital snapshots on a TV screen. Those functions and the arcade-type gaming feature are central to Microsoft's strategy to reach a broader family market, beyond the young male players who have been the Xbox's primary audience.To do that, Peter Moore, vice president for marketing at Xbox International, said Microsoft would eliminate the need for credit cards in making online purchases of games, accessories and upgrades. Instead of credit cards, the Xbox Live online service will accept Microsoft value cards that can be bought in various denominations online or at retail and convenience stores, Moore said. The value cards would function, in effect, like tokens in an arcade. \"We have to get credit cards out of the way,\" he said. \"We've got to broaden this to younger demographics.\" Another big selling point for the 360 is its enhanced Internet connectivity through the Xbox Live service.Microsoft will give Xbox 360 owners a free subscription to Xbox Live Silver, which gives players access to the online system's features, including the ability to buy and download games. A Gold membership, at $50 a year, permits users to play games with others over the Internet. Canessa, the group manager of Xbox Live Arcade, said that each arcade game could play at 1080i high definition and that most could take advantage of the 360's ability to communicate with other players over a broadband Internet connection. \"We will have from 12 to 15 games by launch,\" Canessa said. At least 75 percent, he added, will be capable of being played live online by more than one player.Each Xbox 360, he said, will include a free copy of the full version of \"Hexic HD,\" an arcade-style puzzle game developed by Alexey Pajitnov, the creator of \"Tetris.\" \"We created a whole market, a whole new world, for downloadable games,\" Canessa said. While online arcade games have proved popular on personal computers, Canessa said he believed that the 360's embrace of arcade games would further invigorate independent game design. \"The indie game developers is one of the opportunities I'm most excited about,\" he said. \"You have small, independent, three guys in a garage making games, totally innovating. It's the Sundance Film Festival, if you will, of games.\" "

                " SEATTLE — In a bid to make its games unit profitable by 2007, Microsoft is planning to start selling a more expensive version of its Xbox game console this autumn. The premium Xbox 360 console will sell for $399.99 in the United States, nearly three times the price of the current Xbox, according to an announcement made by Microsoft on Wednesday. The premium console will sell for399.99, or $490.67, in Continental Europe, while its scaled-back version, called \"Xbox 360 Core System,\" will sell for $299.99 in the United States and299.99 in Europe. Microsoft is counting on the new releases of its console to make its video game unit profitable by 2007, according to Robert Bach, senior vice president for Microsoft's home and entertainment division. The game unit of Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, has lost $2.8 billion in the last three years, while Sony's rival console, the PlayStation, is profitable. Bach predicted that the Xbox 360 would outsell Sony's PlayStation 3, which is scheduled for release next year, even though the PlayStation 2 has outsold the Xbox by nearly 4 to 1. Various Xbox accessories, like a 20-gigabyte detachable hard drive and a wireless controller that will be delivered with the premium version of the console, will also be available for purchase as an add-on for the less expensive \"core\" console. Microsoft is also planning to sell other Xbox accessories, like a wireless controller and TV remote, a headset for the Xbox Live online service and an Ethernet cable for high-speed Internet connections. The company said that it remained on target to ship the new Xbox to stores in North America, Europe and Japan in time for the upcoming holiday season, ahead of Sony's PlayStation 3, which is slated to replace the PlayStation 2 in the spring. Bach noted that both new versions of the Xbox would support high-definition visuals and play music and movies. These features were not part of the original Xbox release, which cost $299 four years ago but now sells for $150. Matt Rosoff, an analyst at the independent research firm Directions on Microsoft, said he doubted that enthusiasts would balk at the price increase for the new releases.\"Hard-core gamers will be on board,\" Rosoff said. \"I think the sticker shock might be in the larger audience Microsoft is trying to reach,\" like casual game players and neophytes, he added. Microsoft sells its current Xbox console at a loss because its primary goal was to break into the lucrative game market. It makes money selling games, but does not expect its home and entertainment division to post profits regularly until 2007. \"They need to not lose a lot of money on the console this time,\" said Ben Bajarin, an analyst at Creative Strategies in Campbell, California. \"They'd like to get closer to a small margin of profit on the console.\" The core console will not be able to play games designed for the original Xbox unless a consumer spends $99.99 to add a hard drive. Microsoft has asked developers working on future games to make them in such a way that they could be played on both the fully loaded and basic versions of the console. Pricing for the new Xbox in Japan, where Microsoft sells just a few hundred consoles a week, will not be announced until the Tokyo Game Show in September, Bach said. "

                " SAN JOSE, California — The tit-for- tat battle for customers between Sony and Microsoft continued Thursday as the Japanese electronics group announced plans to introduce an online gaming service when its PlayStation 3 video game console is released in the fall. The news of the service, which lets users buy games and communicate and compete with other players via the Web, comes days after Tokyo-based Sony said that it would delay the release of its next-generation PlayStationconsole until November, putting it a year behind Microsoft's popular Xbox 360. The much-awaited start had originally been scheduled for the spring and the news, on March 15, prompted Microsoft to announce this week that it was more than doubling shipments of the Xbox 360. Phil Harrison, president of worldwide studios for Sony Computer Entertainment, said that the basic level of Sony's online service, known internally as PlayStation Network Platform, would be free, and would allow users to play against each other online, e-mail and chat with friends. Additional game services and premium content will be made available to users who pay a subscription fee, Harrison said. Sony, one of the world's leading technology manufacturers and entertainment companies, is hoping to retain its dominance over the roughly $30 billion global video game market with the PS3. Microsoft introduced the Xbox 360 game console in November. The company's Xbox Live subscription service, which offers game downloads and online play, has been a hit on the new machine and Sony had been widely expected to offer a similar service. Built in collaboration with Sony Online Entertainment, which already offers PC game downloads and a marketplace for trading virtual assets, the service was inspired by businesses like the online auction site eBay and the online retailer Amazon.com, where communities of users contribute ratings and recommendations. It also steals a page from social networking sites like Myspace.com, which has attracted millions of users. \"We have to fall into step with consumer expectations,\" said Harrison, who said the social aspects of the network promise to get people more involved in gaming. With broadband adoption on the rise and television viewership dropping, advertisers are exploring the possibility of buying ad space in games much like they now do on the Web. \"This can provide a tremendous revenue stream for our industry,\" Harrison said. Video game makers, which have seen sales fall as gamers wait and save for new consoles, have been under pressure to find new ways to offset rising game development costs. Microsoft said Tuesday that Xbox Live had logged more than 10 million downloads.More than 85 percent of Xbox 360 consoles that are connected to the Internet have downloaded games, trailers and videos from the subscription service, Microsoft said. Downloads appeal to many game makers, because they can cut costs by selling direct to consumers. Online distribution also gives them a way to head off piracy and used game sales by providing a way to check that the player of a game is also its owner. Anita Frazier, an analyst with NPD Group, a market research company, said most publishers were \"treading lightly\" into direct online sales of games because they do not want to alienate retailers, but added that such services would likely open the market for more games.$@ "

                "Executives at Microsoft are fond of saying that its subscription gaming service, Xbox Live, should be thought of as a cable channel. They want Xbox to be seen not merely as a gaming machine for teenagers, but as a media portal for parents and grandparents, too. The company is even producing shows for users: it is in the middle of the second season of “1 vs. 100,” an interactive version of a game show that was on NBC. The content ambitions do not end there. Microsoft has held in-depth talks with the Walt Disney Company about a programming deal with ESPN, according to people close to the talks, who requested anonymity because the talks were intended to be private. For a per-subscriber fee, ESPN could provide live streams of sporting events, similar to the ones available through ESPN 360, a service that is available from some high-speed Internet providers. Microsoft could also create some interactive games in association with ESPN, the people said. One of the people said the deal was not imminent. The companies declined to comment. Already, video game consoles are putting a new emphasis on the video, rather than the game.  The roughly 20 million monthly members of Xbox Live can surf Facebook, browse an online mall of movies and TV episodes and, if they pay, watch Netflix.  “It’s 20 million connected living rooms,” said Marc Whitten, the general manager of Xbox Live. Similarly, users of the Sony PlayStation can tune into BBC shows and see Weather Channel updates, as well as stream Netflix. Last week, Netflix extended its streaming service to the Nintendo Wii.  Among the many companies that want to transport the on-demand qualities of the Internet into the living room  the over-the-top model, in industry parlance  the console makers have a significant head start. Nearly 60 percent of American homes now have at least one console, according to the consulting firm Deloitte, up from 44 percent three years ago. “For both of the big guys, it’s about extending the value of the hardware platform,” said Mike McGuire, a vice president for the research firm Gartner, referring to Microsoft and Sony. “The devices are hooked to TVs and have broadband connections, and there are more and more opportunities to license movies and TV shows and deliver them in over-the-top models.” Microsoft said this month that it had sold 39 million Xbox 360 consoles around the world. About half sign into Xbox Live each month. At that size, “it starts to feel like a cable network,” said Mark Kroese, who oversees Xbox advertising sales for Microsoft. The company does not specify how many members pay for access to premium services like Netflix; basic functions of Xbox Live are free. The company says it regularly counts more than a million concurrent users  and topped out at 2.2 million at one point during Christmas week last month. That compares favorably to some of the top channels on cable, like TBS and the Cartoon Network, which reach about one million viewers at any given time, according to the Nielsen Company.  The comparisons are crude at best because many of Xbox Live’s users are playing games rather than watching video. No third-party measurement exists, because ratings companies like Nielsen do not yet track the service fully. But there is no doubt that consoles are expanding their domain, something that is evident in Mr. Whitten’s vision of the service: “The entertainment you want, the people you care about, wherever you are.” The addition of Netflix in late 2008 was an important step into the entertainment arena for Xbox, and perhaps a precursor to Microsoft’s current talks with Hollywood producers. Without releasing specific numbers, Mr. Whitten said the streaming movies and TV service were “very, very popular,” including in his own household. Mr. Whitten said Microsoft wanted to be a bigger player in television and film viewing. He declined to comment on the conversations with Disney but said more than once that “there’s going to be a ton of experimentation around business models and rights.” “Our goal is, really, how can we get as much content there as possible,” he said. Disney is not alone in showing an interest in the console market. Many companies sell TV episodes and film rentals through Microsoft’s online store, and Web video ventures are clamoring to have a place on the service. Console makers have a long way to go to be considered replacements for cable subscriptions, but, at the very least, they could put a dent in the time spent viewing traditional TV. The interactive game show “1 vs. 100” drew well over 100,000 concurrent users at times during its first season last year, according to Microsoft’s internal data. During the second season, which began in November, two-hour TV-style trivia competitions are scheduled on Tuesday and Friday nights. A voice-over announcer, shown onscreen as an avatar, provides live color commentary. Like the defunct NBC show, the game has a contestant, “The One,” and a “Mob” of 100 other players. Members of the audience can watch passively or play along, improving their odds of being picked to play for prizes. Unlike on the live-action TV show, every player on Xbox is represented by a cartoonish avatar. Dave McCarthy, a general manager at Microsoft Game Studios, said the scheduled TV-style shows provided a guarantee that “you’re a part of something bigger.” Beyond the game show realm, Microsoft also exclusively shows “The Guild,” a sitcom that it bills as “Seinfeld” meets video game culture. It stars its creator, the actress Felicia Day, and is sponsored by Sprint. For advertisers like Sprint, online communities like Xbox Live are another arena to pursue consumers. Within “1 vs. 100” there are 15- and 30-second commercial breaks like on TV. Those spots account for about 15 percent of the service’s advertising revenue; most of the rest comes from ads on Xbox Live navigation pages, like display ads on Web sites.  In November, Nielsen started to track “1 vs. 100” play and ad views. The pilot program “is the tip of the iceberg,” said Gerardo Guzman, a director for Nielsen Games; eventually, he hopes to generate TV-style ratings. Mr. Kroese said Xbox advertisers were “very interested in being able to compare the media buy on Xbox to other media buys they do.” Microsoft says nearly half of Xbox Live members use its entertainment content; the rest mostly play multiplayer games. But it expects that more of its users will try the entertainment side and the line between them will blur further. “I don’t think there’s a real difference between a game and ‘Lost.’ Or a game and ‘American Idol.’ They’re all ways we spend our leisure time,” Mr. Whitten said.  Over time, he predicted, “these narrow swim lanes  games, music, movies, etc.  will dissolve.”"

                "LOS ANGELES, July 5 — In what may be one of the costliest consumer warranty repairs in history, Microsoft announced on Thursday that it would spend up to $1.15 billion to repair failing Xbox 360 game machine consoles. While the company would not say how many units were failing, Robbie Bach, president of Microsoft’s entertainment and devices division, said that there have been an “unacceptable high number of repairs.” The majority of Xbox 360 owners, he said, have not experienced hardware failure.  Company officials said that Microsoft had sold 11.6 million Xbox 360 units by the end of June, shy of the 12 million units the company had predicted. The Xbox 360, which first went of sale in November 2005, is currently the best-selling game machine in the United States, according to NPD, a market research firm. The size of the anticipated repair bill suggests that a third to as many as half of the machines are flawed.  Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., said it would take a charge of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion against earnings in the quarter ended June 30. Consumers know they have a problem if three red flashing lights appear on the console. Gamers on online forums have been referring to the event as “the Red Ring of Death” because the machine then shuts down.  The company declined to explain the nature of the failure, but said that it was not caused by a single problem in the console, which it said contained 1,700 components and 500 million transistors. The company also said there were no health or safety concerns involved. The problem began to appear over the last three to four months, Mr. Bach said, after “significant usage” of the consoles. He said the company has taken steps to correct the problem in new devices. Microsoft said it would extend the warranty of the game console to three years to customers worldwide. Previously, products sold in the United States were covered by a one-year warranty, while Xbox 360 units sold in Europe had a two-year warranty.  In addition, customers who have had their consoles repaired because of the “three flashing lights” problem will be reimbursed for the cost of the repairs. Microsoft has succeeded in establishing the Xbox brand against the better known Sony PlayStation and other game machines. The Xbox and its successor, the Xbox 360, was the software maker’s first major foray into hardware. Although sales are small relative to the rest of Microsoft’s revenue, the Xbox has been an important venture for the company and was viewed by many analysts as Microsoft’s attempt to compete with the likes of Sony and Apple for control of electronics and entertainment within homes.  The device can be used to access the Internet and view movies. Microsoft said its entertainment and devices division reported an operating loss of $315 million on $929 million in revenue for the three-month period that ended in March, and analysts have estimated that the company lost about $6 billion getting a foothold in the game machine industry.  A new Xbox 360 with a 20-gigabyte hard drive sells for about $400, but other versions cost about $300.  The announcement comes on the eve of the E3 Media and Business Summit, the video-game industry’s major trade show, to be held next week in Los Angeles. “This is bound to affect discussions between Microsoft and its developers and retailers,” said Richard Doherty, a partner in the research company Envisioneering Group."

                "One of the enduring attractions of comic books and graphic novels is the ease with which they explain the universe. Evil is identifiable, external and fairly simple to vanquish with the application of the appropriate superpowers. And sometimes, as in the case of ABC Family’s new comic-based series “The Middleman,” evil is downright funny. In “Middleman’s” first episode, last week, a slimy, many-eyed, multitentacled creature erupts in a DNA lab. Later, evil’s personification is a mobster ape with a machine gun. These over-the-top creatures are more comic than threatening. Usually the phrase “cartoonish violence” is a pejorative; here it’s a compliment. “The Middleman,” written as a graphic novel by Javier Grillo-Marxuach, who has also written for the series “Lost” and “Medium,” stars Matt Keeslar in the title role, a straight-arrow, milk-drinking former member of the Navy Seals who stands between us and horrors we’re not even aware of, fighting evil “so you don’t have to.” He dresses like a Canadian Mountie and delivers his lines with the stone-face confidence of a young Peter Graves. Early on, he explains the world to his protégée. “You know how in comic books there’s all kinds of mad scientists and aliens and androids and monsters who want to either take over or destroy the world?” he asks. “Well, it really does work like that.” This is news to Wendy Watson (Natalie Morales), an art-school graduate and temp secretary whose calm in the face of the multitentacled slime creature  she stabs it with a letter opener  inspires the Middleman to recruit her. “You’re good under pressure,” he says. She asks, “Are you hitting on me?” There is some sexual tension between these two, but you hope it won’t become a big part of the story; there’s much more interesting material here. “Middleman” is full of hilarious throwaways, as when our hero, preparing to drink a glass of “cool refreshing milk” with some bad guys, empties his pockets  of grenades, flamethrowers and a crossbow.  The genius is in the details. When the Middleman asks Wendy if she has experience with firearms, and she says she’s a pacifist, he looks at her fingers. Their calluses tell him that she is a veteran Xbox player. “You probably have better hand-eye than a bush sniper,” he concludes. “Middleman” skillfully incorporates real-life details into its fantastic scenarios. Its characters aren’t just Manichaean warriors; they also live the kinds of lives that people read comic books to escape from. “Did I get any calls?” Wendy asks her roommate after a rough day at the office. The roommate says: “Yeah. Your mom called to ask if you’re a lesbian.” That would be the mom whom Wendy describes as “on me 24/7 to quit painting, move back to Orlando, meet a good man, eat fried foods, swell up like a tick and start squeezing out calves like Elsie mainlining fertility drugs.” Then there’s the motive of the mad scientist who created the gun-toting ape; she’s just trying to compensate for federal cuts to her research grants. Saving the world is easy; making a world as complex and funny as this one is the real feat of “Middleman.” THE MIDDLEMAN ABC Family, Monday nights at 8, Eastern and Pacific times; 7, Central time. Created by Javier Grillo-Marxuach, based on his Viper Comics graphic novels, with illustrations by Les McClaine; directed by Jeremiah Chechik; Mr. Grillo-Marxuach and John Ziffren, executive producers; Hans Beimler, co-executive producer; Jon Pare, producer; Sarah Watson, co-producer; Mr. Chechik and Tracey Stern, supervising producers.

                "TOKYO, Dec. 16 - In the United States, Microsoft's Xbox 360 video game console has been so popular it is hard to keep on store shelves. But in Tokyo's neon-drenched Akihabara neighborhood, known as Electronics Town, there are plenty of the sleek white machines to go around, if you can find takers. At Yodobashi Camera, an eight-story electronics department store selling everything from hair curlers to home computer servers, a small corner display of Xbox 360's draws little attention from passing shoppers. It is not hard to figure out why. Lined up on a rack near the display are the only nine games sold for Xbox 360. But behind it are some 3,000 games, spread across six store aisles, for Microsoft's biggest rival here, the Sony PlayStation 2. \"Xbox doesn't even have Gran Turismo,\" said Shun'ichi Moriizumi, naming a popular auto racing game. One of the few shoppers to stop in front of the Xbox display, Mr. Moriizumi, a 22-year-old university student, said he came to see the Xbox 360, which went on sale here Dec. 10, 18 days after its debut in the United States. \"I like the graphics,\" he said \"But I'm not going to buy it, at least not today. I'm waiting until the new PlayStation comes out before deciding which to buy.\" That appears to be a common sentiment in Japan, the world's second-largest video game market after the United States. The Xbox 360 had a disappointing opening day in Japan. During the first weekend the Xbox 360 was in stores, Microsoft sold 62,135 of about 159,000 machines shipped, or about 39 percent, according to a Japanese market research company, Enterbrain. That pace was even slower than in 2002, when Microsoft introduced its earlier Xbox model in Japan, where it was considered a flop. Microsoft was hoping to make a bigger splash this time, not just because of the market's size here but also because of Japan's importance as a proving ground for new products. Japan is, after all, home to Microsoft's two biggest rivals in video games, Sony and Nintendo, and its software companies write many of the games played worldwide, from Super Mario Brothers to Final Fantasy. Winning over Japan's finicky consumers, who are known to reject games for seemingly minor shortcomings in performance and appearance, represents a coveted seal of approval, analysts say. So far, Microsoft has failed the test. As of June, the latest data available, 470,000 Xbox machines over all have been sold in Japan, versus 13 million in the United States, according to the market research site Famitsu.com. That gave Xbox a mere 2 percent slice of the 22 million game machines sold in Japan. By contrast, Xbox had a 25 percent share of the 52 million machines sold in the United States, according to Famitsu. Analysts say the biggest hurdle the Xbox 360 faces in Japan is the dominance of Sony and to a lesser extent Nintendo. Sony has 81 percent of the Japanese market; Nintendo has most of the rest, according to Famitsu. Worldwide, PlayStation's market share is about 68 percent; Xbox is in second place with 17 percent and Nintendo has the rest. Microsoft had hoped to steal a march by rolling out its next-generation XBox game machine ahead of its two Japanese rivals. Sony plans to sell its newest game console, PlayStation 3, in the spring, though the company will not say exactly when. Nintendo says it will release its new console, Revolution, in 2006. But Microsoft's strategy does not seem to be working, analysts say. One problem they note is that Microsoft introduced Xbox 360 before there was much game software to play on it. That makes the Xbox 360 less attractive next to the vastly larger number of games available for PlayStation. Microsoft says more games are in the pipeline, including the latest version of the popular Dead or Alive, which is supposed to go on sale here later this month. \"We didn't have a rocket start,\" said Asako Miyata, a spokeswoman in Japan for Microsoft. \"But we see sales steadily picking up as more games become available.\" Analysts say, however, that even when more games appear, Microsoft may have trouble luring first-time buyers because of the need to replace their game software libraries. Because so many consumers now own PlayStation 2, it would be easier for them to wait for the arrival of PlayStation 3, which would be able to play all their current games, . \"Sony has such a high penetration rate,\" said John Yang, an electronics analyst in Tokyo for Standard & Poor's rating agency. \"It is not uncommon for households here to have two or even three PS2's,\" he said, referring to the current PlayStation model. \"Why would an entire household want to switch to Xbox?\" Takashi Sudo, a manager for the video game department at the Yodobashi Camera store, said several hundred people showed up for the opening day of Xbox 360 at his store. But he said he expected a crowd at least five times as large for the PlayStation 3 debut in the spring. For that, he says, he will need to set up a line of special booths to handle the crunch. \"This is Sony's country,\" Mr. Sudo said. \"Xbox has to break into a market that Sony built.\""

                "SANTA MONICA, Calif., July 10 — As Microsoft executives played down the impact of an extensive repair program for defective Xbox 360 game machines, they announced several efforts to broaden the appeal of their machine to families.  Opening the annual E3 game conference here, Microsoft executives announced a deal to distribute films from the Walt Disney Company on Microsoft’s Xbox Live Internet service and outlined a broader array of games focused mostly on children and families.  Executives predicted that the company’s recently announced plan to spend up to $1.15 billion to fix defective Xbox 360 game machine would improve, not undermine, the system’s image with consumers.   “The important impact for us is that our customers know we’re going to support the console and support them and if they have issues, we’ll take care of it,” said Robert J. Bach, president of Microsoft’s entertainment and devices division, in an interview. “It won’t change what’s happening in the marketplace because the industry is about the games and we think we have the games that will get people really excited this year.”  As the game industry’s growth has slowed in recent years, game developers have tried to reach beyond the young male players who have been the target audience.  “We believe we have the best game lineup in video-game history for the holiday season,” said Mr. Bach. “You can look top to bottom and we think we have the goods to please any type of gamer.”  Part of Microsoft’s strategy has been to position the Xbox 360 as a living room media hub and an essential element of that plan has been allowing users to download films and television shows to the machine. Adding Disney to the roster of companies distributing movies and video programming over the Xbox Live service should help broaden the appeal of the game system to families with children. The same could be said of the new games Microsoft announced here, including a new installment of the company’s Viva Pinata game and a version of the Scene It? board game. Scene It? will come with a new controller for the Xbox 360 with large buttons and a simple layout that game novices, intimidated by a traditional game controller, may find easier to use “Part of our strategy is we want to win this generation and in order to do that we have to expand beyond the core gamer audience that we’ve had success with and that means appealing to the broad consumer market,” said Shane Kim, general manager of Microsoft Game Studios. The company also said it was developing a keyboard for the Xbox 360 controller. Currently, Xbox Live users send text messages using an on-screen keyboard. The company recently announced plans to integrate the popular Windows Live Messenger service with Xbox Live.  But even as Microsoft hopes to appeal to new sorts of users, the company wants to avoid neglecting the serious player. So Microsoft also said that the next version of the popular Resident Evil series from Capcom of Japan would also be designed to run on the Xbox 360.   In the past, Resident Evil games have run only on Nintendo and Sony consoles. Persuading Capcom to develop games for the Xbox 360 underlines the success Microsoft has had recently in attracting Japanese developers who had shied away from the American console. "

                "AFTER a 31-year-old Manhattan financial executive received Microsoft's Xbox video game system as a gift in January, he walked to a store and bought a half-dozen game titles. The video game industry would have been pleased to hear it. After he played those games a few times against computer-controlled opponents, he got a bit bored and signed up for Microsoft's Xbox Live service, which enabled him to play against other people online. The video game industry, again, would have been pleased. After a few months on the Xbox Live network, in May, he got a bit bored again. This time, however, he opened his Xbox and soldered in a chip that allowed him to change the console's basic computer code and bypass its internal security technology. After installing a new hard drive, he transferred about 3,000 MP3 music files to the system and downloaded illegal copies of 3,500 old-time arcade games. Then he installed the Linux operating system, which allowed him to use the box essentially as a personal computer. Needless to say, the video game industry would not have been pleased. When Microsoft released the Xbox in November 2001, it was heralded as far more than a game machine. Even as the Xbox took aim at Sony's PlayStation 2 game empire, the console was meant to lead Microsoft's broader invasion of the living room. Incorporating a hard drive, which made it more readily adaptable than other consoles, the Xbox had the potential to be a digital-entertainment nerve center. Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, said at the time, ''We're going to put new software that runs on Xbox that, both in the gaming dimension and other dimensions, will amaze people with the power that's in this box.'' That is happening, but not necessarily as Microsoft planned. All sorts of new software is indeed running on Xbox consoles these days, and they are in fact becoming home-entertainment hubs, but it is not Microsoft doing the amazing. Rather, an online confederacy apparently numbering in the thousands -- including accomplished hackers of varied motives and everyday technophiles like the Manhattan financial executive (who shared his experience on the condition of anonymity) -- is taking the lead. Those involved often call their efforts ''unleashing'' or ''unshackling'' -- freeing the Xbox to express its inner PC. Technology industry executives, however, often call such activity a bald attempt to hijack the Xbox illegally. It is a battle that involves many of the ethical and legal issues facing the technology and media industries at this digital moment. What rights do consumers have to tinker with products they own? How far should companies go to protect their intellectual property? What happens when the desires of consumers conflict with the business models of companies they patronize? Who gets to decide just what a particular product may be used for? The Xbox is a particularly attractive target for hackers because while it is essentially a standard PC modified to do only a few things, like play Xbox games, it is much cheaper than a PC. It is like an economy car modified to follow only a few roads -- but one potentially as powerful as a far more expensive model. In the Xbox, that power comes in the form of a 733-megahertz Intel processor, comparable to a midrange personal computer, and sophisticated graphics and audio systems. Its limited operating system, based on a version of Windows, can be used by a programmer to run simple software like a music player -- or the machine can run a new operating system altogether, namely Linux. ''The reality is that if you could bypass Microsoft's operating system you would end up with a fairly powerful computer for less than $200,'' the Manhattan financial executive said. In fact, Microsoft lowered the price for Xbox to $179.99 in May. In a sense, Xbox hackers are exploiting Microsoft's business model, which is to sell Xbox hardware at a loss (to build penetration of the system) and make the money back on royalties from the sale of Xbox software. A PC manufacturer like Dell, meanwhile, has to recoup its costs and generate a profit from the initial sale. So someone who buys the Xbox hardware, modifies it into a general-purpose computer and does not buy Xbox games potentially undermines not only Microsoft but also the personal computer industry. But that is not how some Xbox hackers think about it. ''Especially in Europe, computers are more expensive than they are here, and the Xbox is the cheapest computer you can get,'' Andrew Huang, author of a new book called ''Hacking the Xbox: An Introduction to Reverse Engineering,'' said in a telephone interview. ''Basically,'' he added by e-mail, ''once you have Linux, you have everything.'' It is unclear just how many Xbox hackers there are. Officials of the Interactive Digital Software Association, a trade group of video game publishers, said that Xbox hacking appeared more prevalent in parts of Asia than in North America. Michael Steil, a 24-year-old German who is project leader of a group that calls itself the Xbox Linux Project, said by e-mail that a full version of Linux software for the Xbox had been downloaded more than 220,000 times. Whatever the numbers, Microsoft does not appear eager to discuss Xbox hacking. In recent weeks, a Microsoft public relations representative repeatedly declined to make any company executives available to discuss the matter. Instead, the company issued a statement through a public relations firm that said in part: ''Microsoft is a company passionate about innovation and creativity. We are also very committed to respect for others' intellectual property and we request the same respect applied to our innovations.'' The statement made no reference to the potential use of hacked Xbox consoles as personal computers, saying Microsoft's ''primary concern'' was with the sale of modified chips for the boxes ''that enable game counterfeiting.'' And that is the area that most clearly raises legal issues. Although there are several methods, hacking an Xbox typically involves obtaining a special chip called a modchip, available on the Internet, and soldering it into the machine. (For those who find the process daunting, there are also vendors on the Internet who sell ''pre-modded'' Xbox units.) Modchips, of which there are several varieties, allow users to load new versions of the basic computer code, known as the BIOS, that tells the machine how to operate. A hacked BIOS generally incorporates modified versions of copyrighted Microsoft code and so is generally illegal. The main Web sites that deal with Xbox hacking do not include links to hacked BIOS, and hackers generally find their forbidden fruit in Internet chat rooms. Once the modchip is installed and the BIOS modified, the console can do a number of things it cannot do ''out of the box.'' Xbox games normally must be run from an optical disk, and a hacked Xbox can ''back up'' a game to the unit's hard drive and run the game without the disk. This technique could be used simply to avoid having to insert and remove disks -- or it could be used for piracy (say, by renting a game, putting the software on the hard drive and returning the game). Until passage of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act in 1998, the mere sale of a modified chip would not have appeared illegal. That law, however, prohibits the sale of devices that are primarily meant to circumvent copyright protection. Companies and technologists will fight over the exact legal meaning of those provisions for years. For now, however, the software industry is relying on them. ''Our view over all on modchips is that they are illegal infringing devices, that where we find people engaged in the widespread manufacturing and distribution of them, we and our members, individually and collectively, are committed to doing what we can to shut down their manufacturing and go after the distributors,'' said Doug Lowenstein, president of the Interactive Digital Software Association. Some advocates, however, say that while software piracy is illegal and morally offensive, the mere act of modifying hardware should not be illegal. ''The most important dimension of this debate from our view is that people should have the right to tinker with the stuff that they own,'' said Fred von Lohmann, senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a civil-liberties group in San Francisco. ''Others will say that this is about piracy and all that, but they forget that the principle of tinkering with the stuff that you own was the principle on which the entire personal computer industry was founded,'' he added. ''This is basic business and basic science in the technology world and we think that this right to tinker, this freedom to tinker, remains legally protected.'' For now, however, the federal government seems to agree with Mr. Lowenstein. Last December, David M. Rocci, a 22-year-old from Blacksburg, Va., pleaded guilty to a federal charge of conspiring to import, market and sell modchips for the Xbox. In April, he was sentenced to five months in prison and five months of home detention. Simply from the standpoint of accessibility, the PlayStation 2 would seem to be a more likely candidate for hacking. IDG, the technology research firm, estimates that at the end of last year, 38.1 million PlayStation 2 units were in use in Europe, North America and Japan combined, compared with 6.7 million Xbox units in those regions. In one sense, however, the hacking scene for PlayStation 2 is less developed than the one for Xbox because there is less appetite for it. Sony sells an official conversion kit for the PlayStation 2 that includes a hard drive and allows that system to run the Linux operating system, which in turn allows the system to run MP3's, movies, spreadsheets or any other program or data that works under Linux. It is relatively easy for Sony to embrace Linux because Sony, unlike Microsoft, is not in the operating system business. The PlayStation 2 hacking community seems focused on developing chips that allow PlayStation 2 units to run illegal copies of games and games meant for far-flung parts of the world. (For marketing reasons, many PlayStation 2 games include regional coding, much as DVD's do.) In 2001, Sony sued an Australian for selling modchips that allowed Australian PlayStation 2 units to play games from other parts of the world. After the Australian government argued on the man's behalf, however, the Federal Court of Australia last July ruled mostly against Sony. Mr. von Lohmann said that Microsoft had not been particularly aggressive in combating Xbox hackers but that Sony had actively fought them. A Sony spokeswoman did not respond this week to requests for comment about the company's approach to hackers. For its part, Microsoft, through its public relations agency, indicated that it believed Xbox hackers were a relatively small band. ''Aside from a set of hobbyists,'' it said, ''the vast majority of Xbox owners are not focused on this niche.'' But those who are appear quite focused indeed. By e-mail, Mr. Steil, the German leader of the Xbox Linux project, declared: ''In very simple words: The Xbox is cheaper than a PC. The Xbox is a lot smaller than a PC. The Xbox looks better (next to a TV set). The Xbox is more silent. Therefore it's an ideal Linux computer in the living room.'' That was probably not the vision Mr. Gates had in mind."

                "WHEN the dust finally settled on the 2006 holiday buying season, American consumers — who braved long lines, cold weather and possibly a few kicks to the shins — had spent $3.7 billion on new video-game consoles and software. And while the more than two million youngsters (and not-so-youngsters) who discovered a next-generation gaming system under the Christmas tree — a Microsoft Xbox 360, a Sony PlayStation 3 or a Nintendo Wii — represent a substantial user base for these platforms, they mean even more to the entertainment industry as a whole. To the makers of these video-game systems and to a growing number of film and television studios, they represent a significant new audience for full-length movies and television shows that can be downloaded directly to gaming consoles. In late November Microsoft began expanding the library on its Xbox Live network, a broadband service available by subscription to Xbox 360 owners. In addition to the video-game trailers and playable demonstrations that the network has traditionally offered, you can now find an eclectically selected collection of films and television shows offered for downloading to a console’s hard drive: for a few dollars you can view “Mission: Impossible III” or “Chinatown” or the episode of “Chappelle’s Show” with the blind white supremacist, on your television, just as if you were watching a DVD or a video-on-demand channel.  For gamers with top-shelf home-theater setups, Xbox Live also offers content in high definition: download the HD version of the “Star Trek” episode “Mirror, Mirror,” in which the Enterprise crew is accidentally beamed into a malevolent alternate reality, and you can practically count each strand of hair in evil Mr. Spock’s goatee. This month XBox Live will offer a new view of the corpulent form of Eric Cartman when it becomes the first outlet ever to offer an episode of “South Park” in high definition. While Microsoft acknowledges that most consumers are buying Xbox 360s primarily, if not solely, to play video games, the company also sees an opportunity to use film and television content to draw an audience that doesn’t fit the stereotypical gamer profile.  “The original Xbox was probably the domain of that testosterone-fueled male in the household, and while we love him to death, we also want his little brother and sister and mom and dad and their friends to be able to enjoy it,” said Peter Moore, corporate vice president of Microsoft’s interactive entertainment business division.  To that end Microsoft spent several months negotiating with Hollywood studios and television networks, including Warner Brothers, Paramount, CBS and MTV, to secure a broad variety of programming before rolling out the expanded Xbox Live service.  Although more than 4.5 million Xbox 360s have been sold, and some 60 percent of owners are connected to Xbox Live, the network’s audience will not make broadcast television or movie theaters obsolete any time soon. Yet the kind of content most abundantly available on the network — goofy comedies like “Nacho Libre” and “Zoolander,” clips of Nascar races and adventure films like “Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior” — clearly indicates whom Microsoft expects to make the most use of it: men in their 20s and 30s with enough disposable income to buy lots of video games.  “This guy is typically not going to the movies, and more often than not he’s not watching television, he’s playing games in the living room,” Mr. Moore said. “He’s a difficult person to get to in the first place.”  It is Xbox Live’s potential to deliver such a narrowly defined and increasingly difficult-to-reach demographic that makes it so enticing to the entertainment industry. “This is, to a large extent, an entirely new audience for us,” said Steve Beeks, the president of Lionsgate, an independent studio whose library includes horror movies like “The Descent” and the “Saw” franchise and which recently announced it would make its films available for download on Xbox Live. “These are active buyers of games, but we don’t believe they’ve been active buyers of movies. We’re turning them into consumers of films.”  For television networks whose programming appears on the service, Xbox Live offers the additional benefit of a precise metric to determine how many gamers are downloading their shows and how many are then seeking out these shows on broadcast television.  “We’re gauging how different clips translate into what kind of pickup in viewership we get and what kind of buzz we’re getting on the blogs,” said Dennis Quinn, Turner Broadcasting’s executive vice president for business development. “If they’re watching a six-minute clip of ‘Robot Chicken,’ is that translating into a greater sampling of the network show? If we see older shows like ‘Harvey Birdman’ picking up again, what does that mean for people who produce the content?” At least one of Microsoft’s competitors is also preparing to enter this digital arena. Sony’s PlayStation 3, which comes with the ability to play high-definition Blu-ray DVDs, also allows gamers to connect to Sony’s own broadband network. Right now that network doesn’t offer much more than video-game demos and movie trailers, but that will soon change.  “As long as you’re downloading a trailer, what’s to stop us from offering the entire program, whether it’s a movie or a TV show?” said Peter Dille, the senior vice president for marketing for Sony Computer Entertainment America. “Being part of Sony Corporation, with a film entertainment company as a sister company and a music company at arm’s length, the world is our oyster in many respects.” For the moment Nintendo has no immediate plans to make film and television programming available for its Wii game console, which also lets gamers connect to an Internet-based network of content channels. But the company did not rule out the possibility.  “There’s a lot of plans we have for the channels,” said Perrin Kaplan, Nintendo’s vice president for marketing. “And there are ways that they could be used that we haven’t yet really conceived of.” Though Microsoft is the only gaming company to provide a substantial content library (roughly 100 movies and several hundred television episodes so far), some gamers feel the offerings are too limited to encourage them to use the feature regularly.  “Until you feel like it’s a pretty comprehensive list where you can look up just about anything, it’s not a service that I think most people will use,” said Dan Hsu, editor in chief of Electronic Gaming Monthly magazine. “You can just go, ‘Well, maybe I’ll check the iTunes music store or nbc.com and see if they have the shows that I want.’ ”  Other industry executives say the current push to provide entertainment content has more to do with satisfying console manufacturers’ needs than with fulfilling gamers’ demands.  “For this round of consoles it makes total sense that they have to focus on entertainment,” said Ricardo Sanchez, an executive at GameTap, a service that lets subscribers play console and arcade games on their personal computers. “For Sony I’ve got to believe the PS3 is as much about establishing Blu-ray as it is about selling games. On the Microsoft side they’re betting so much on Xbox Live that they’ll do practically anything to drive awareness and interest in it.”  At the same time, Mr. Sanchez said, “I don’t see them spending a lot of effort, beyond just aggregating content you can get elsewhere.”  Most gamers understand that in exchange for the ability to watch “South Park” reruns on demand, they are giving the console makers something: a valuable piece of real estate in their home-theater cabinets that a DVD player or stereo receiver might otherwise occupy. That bargain is especially precious for Microsoft, which is still better known as a monolithic software company than a trusted manufacturer of home electronics.  “This is following years of Bill Gates wanting to pursue something around a set-top box,” said Josh Larson, the director of the video-game Web site GameSpot.com. “It’s kind of a Trojan horse into the living room.” But as media ploys go, Mr. Larson would rather download his movies from Xbox Live than from PC-based services like Movielink or Amazon.com’s Unbox. “Is it more likely for a gamer that you’re going to download from iTunes and hook your PC up to your TV set?” he asked. “Or a couple button-pushes and you’re watching it in a way that you’re used to watching that content? I think that’s pretty powerful.” Despite the enduring perception that his company is seeking to conquer the universe, Mr. Moore said Microsoft was looking only to provide an audience of savvy, affluent media consumers with the kind of products they want in the way they’ve grown accustomed to consuming them. “In my case,” he said, “I very rarely watch live television anymore. Shows like ‘Lost,’ I’ll wait for the DVD, thank you, rather than have to see it chopped up into five-minute increments with four minutes of commercials. In today’s world we don’t have appointment viewing anymore.” More recently, Mr. Moore said, he was looking to catch up on some recent episodes of “CSI” — in high-definition, preferably — and sure enough, the only place he could find them was on Xbox Live. “I live in Seattle,” he explained, “and I have DirecTV. They don’t put the local networks on in high-def.”"

                "Owners of Microsoft's Xbox 360 game console will soon be able to watch science fiction epics as well as play them. Microsoft said last night that it would offer movies and episodes of television shows for downloading through its Xbox Live online service in the United States, starting Nov. 22. With the new offerings, Microsoft is joining cable giants and Internet start-ups on the long list of companies hoping to profit from video downloading. But Internet-based services have had trouble getting traction because it can be complex to send a downloaded film to a television screen and frustrating to watch it on the small screen of a computer. Owners of the Xbox have already connected it to a TV and, in most cases, the Internet. \"What makes this big is that there's no PC in the middle,\" said Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group. Microsoft has negotiated the rights to rent or sell more than 1,000 hours of material from CBS, MTV Networks, Paramount, Warner Brothers and Turner Broadcasting, along with the martial arts show \"Ultimate Fighting Championship.\" Some programs will be available in high-definition video. The video store will work much like that of Apple Computer, with some important differences. While users will be able to keep television shows, movies can be rented for only a limited period. The videos will not be playable on other devices and cannot be burned onto DVDs, but the online service will keep track of purchases so that users can log in to watch their videos on a friend's Xbox. Peter Moore, Microsoft's corporate vice president for interactive entertainment, said that the price of standard-definition videos would be comparable to what competitors charged. Apple's iTunes charges $1.99 for an episode of a television program. High-definition content will cost more, Mr. Moore said, because of the costs involved in storing it and making it available for downloading. Purchases will be made with points that users can buy with a credit card or a gift certificate, or win in contests. Mr. Moore said the service was partly intended to make the Xbox more versatile and therefore more attractive. \"Direct revenue from this over the long term could be important,\" Mr. Moore said. \"But this is also another reason to buy an Xbox 360.\" New game consoles from Sony and Nintendo are due out this month, a year after the Xbox 360 went on sale, so extra features could help Microsoft keep up in the marketplace. Nintendo is concentrating on game play, but Sony says it also has other content in mind. \"We haven't announced any content besides games,\" said Dave Karraker, a spokesman for Sony Computer Entertainment America, \"but all the executives have said that downloading other entertainment content is something the PlayStation 3 is capable of doing.\" Judging by the initial offerings, Xbox Live will be something of a cyberspace version of the Spike Channel, MTV Networks' cable channel aimed at young men. It will sell episodes of \"Star Trek,\" remastered in high definition, as well as the \"C.S.I.\" shows, some music videos and cartoons from the Cartoon Network's \"Adult Swim.\" \"The interesting thing is that we're delivering the 18-to-34-year-olds who aren't watching TV,\" Mr. Moore said. Microsoft has sold more than two million Xbox 360 consoles in the United States, according to the NPD Group, a market research firm. Most of those who buy the machines sign up for the Xbox Live service, which requires broadband Internet access and allows users to compete against each other. Since the introduction of the Xbox 360 last year, the service has also sold simple video games and other material. This year, Microsoft started to hint at its ambitions for the Xbox Live service when it purchased a company that places advertising in video games and made an ad deal with Cadillac. In the last few years, Microsoft has been pushing the idea of Media Center PCs, which are meant to sit in the living room and supply music and video to the stereo and the television set. But the concept has not caught on, in part because of the complexity of setting up and using these systems. Mr. Enderle said that apart from simplicity, another feature that would set the XBox Live service apart is that it will be the first service to sell downloadable movies in high definition, at a resolution similar to or better than a DVD. Until now, he said, most studios have been reluctant to allow cable channels to show movies in high definition for fear of piracy, but that would be less of a threat on XBox Live. Early next year, Apple plans to introduce a product that, on a preliminary basis, it is calling iTV and that is intended to be a bridge between the computer and the television set. But Microsoft will go into the video business with a different business model. Apple, most analysts maintain, does not make much money selling iTunes content, but makes up for that by selling more iPods, which are extremely profitable. Microsoft, which analysts say loses money on each Xbox 360 it sells, expects to make up for that by selling games -- and now video. \"This is a razors-and-blades business,\" Mr. Moore said. \"I've taken the hit on the razor. And the ability of Microsoft to offer more blades gives consumers more choice and drives more revenue.\" The video downloads, especially those in high definition, will take up a lot of space. Microsoft says a one-hour television program in high definition will take up about 2 gigabytes of the console's standard 20-gigabyte hard drive. Microsoft says the Xbox will play both movies and TV shows as they are being downloaded, although with larger files there will be a delay before playback starts, in contrast to the video-on-demand services offered by cable companies. High-definition movies will take an especially long while, depending on the speed of the Internet connection. Editors' Note: November 10, 2006, Friday An article in Business Day on Tuesday described a decision by Microsoft to offer movies and episodes of television shows for downloading through its Xbox Live online service in the United States. The article quoted Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group, discussing the features that set Xbox Live service apart and its position in the market. But the article did not note that Mr. Enderle had Microsoft as a client, a fact later pointed out by a reader. Mr. Enderle does consulting work for several of Microsoft's product groups, though not for the one developing the Xbox; still, had The Times known of Mr. Enderle's work for Microsoft, it would not have sought out his opinion on the product."

                "TOKYO — Microsoft is expected to slash the price of its Xbox 360 game console in Japan by about 30 percent, below the price of Nintendo's Wii and Sony's PlayStation 3 as it tries to increase its market share, a newspaper reported Monday. Demand for the Xbox 360 has been tepid in Japan, mainly due to a lack of popular games. In contrast, the market-leading Wii is thriving on a range of innovative software, prompting Nintendo to raise its earning forecast Friday. Hiroshi Kamide, a KBC Securities analyst, said a price cut alone is unlikely to trigger a jump in demand for the Xbox 360 and Microsoft needs to focus more on producing attractive software. \"Popular software is now serving as a tail wind to Xbox sales,\" he said. \"Even if they slash the console price, that would not directly boost sales unless they release more good software.\" Robust demand for Namco Bandai's \"Tales of Vesperia\" role-playing game helped Xbox 360's Japanese sales in the week ended Aug. 10. beat the PlayStation 3 for the first time. Microsoft will lower the price of the Xbox 360 Arcade model by ¥8,000 to ¥19,800, or about $180, the Nikkei business daily said. The Arcade does not come equipped with a hard drive and is the least expensive of the three Xbox 360 models. The company has already cut the price in the United States, Europe and four Asian markets as it tries to grab a larger chunk of the $57 billion game industry. The new price will make that model cheaper than Nintendo's Wii, which sells for about ¥25,000 yen, and the PlayStation 3, which sells for ¥39,800. The Wii's success has been attributed to inventive titles like the \"Wii Fit\" exercise game, its low price and its easy-to-learn motion-sensing controller. Microsoft will also reduce the price of two more expensive models with hard drives by ¥5,000 to ¥8,000, the paper said. Kazumi Ishiyama, a Microsoft Xbox spokeswoman in Japan, declined to comment on the Nikkei report. The company is scheduled to hold a briefing on the Xbox 360 in the Japanese market Monday afternoon. In Europe, the Xbox 360 Arcade model already costs less than the Wii. The Xbox 360 has lagged its Japanese rivals on their home turf, with 684,695 units sold so far in Japan against Wii's 6.67 million and PlayStation 3's 2.32 million, according to the game magazine publisher Enterbrain. The Xbox 360 was introduced about a year before its rivals."

                "AFTER a 31-year-old Manhattan financial executive received Microsoft's Xbox video game system as a gift in January, he walked to a store and bought a half-dozen game titles. The video game industry would have been pleased to hear it. After he played those games a few times against computer-controlled opponents, he got a bit bored and signed up for Microsoft's Xbox Live service, which enabled him to play against other people online. The video game industry, again, would have been pleased. After a few months on the Xbox Live network, in May, he got a bit bored again. This time, however, he opened his Xbox and soldered in a chip that allowed him to change the console's basic computer code and bypass its internal security technology. After installing a new hard drive, he transferred about 3,000 MP3 music files to the system and downloaded illegal copies of 3,500 old-time arcade games. Then he installed the Linux operating system, which allowed him to use the box essentially as a personal computer. Needless to say, the video game industry would not have been pleased. When Microsoft released the Xbox in November 2001, it was heralded as far more than a game machine. Even as the Xbox took aim at Sony's PlayStation 2 game empire, the console was meant to lead Microsoft's broader invasion of the living room. Incorporating a hard drive, which made it more readily adaptable than other consoles, the Xbox had the potential to be a digital-entertainment nerve center. Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, said at the time, ''We're going to put new software that runs on Xbox that, both in the gaming dimension and other dimensions, will amaze people with the power that's in this box.'' That is happening, but not necessarily as Microsoft planned. All sorts of new software is indeed running on Xbox consoles these days, and they are in fact becoming home-entertainment hubs, but it is not Microsoft doing the amazing. Rather, an online confederacy apparently numbering in the thousands -- including accomplished hackers of varied motives and everyday technophiles like the Manhattan financial executive (who shared his experience on the condition of anonymity) -- is taking the lead. Those involved often call their efforts ''unleashing'' or ''unshackling'' -- freeing the Xbox to express its inner PC. Technology industry executives, however, often call such activity a bald attempt to hijack the Xbox illegally. It is a battle that involves many of the ethical and legal issues facing the technology and media industries at this digital moment. What rights do consumers have to tinker with products they own? How far should companies go to protect their intellectual property? What happens when the desires of consumers conflict with the business models of companies they patronize? Who gets to decide just what a particular product may be used for? The Xbox is a particularly attractive target for hackers because while it is essentially a standard PC modified to do only a few things, like play Xbox games, it is much cheaper than a PC. It is like an economy car modified to follow only a few roads -- but one potentially as powerful as a far more expensive model. In the Xbox, that power comes in the form of a 733-megahertz Intel processor, comparable to a midrange personal computer, and sophisticated graphics and audio systems. Its limited operating system, based on a version of Windows, can be used by a programmer to run simple software like a music player -- or the machine can run a new operating system altogether, namely Linux. ''The reality is that if you could bypass Microsoft's operating system you would end up with a fairly powerful computer for less than $200,'' the Manhattan financial executive said. In fact, Microsoft lowered the price for Xbox to $179.99 in May. In a sense, Xbox hackers are exploiting Microsoft's business model, which is to sell Xbox hardware at a loss (to build penetration of the system) and make the money back on royalties from the sale of Xbox software. A PC manufacturer like Dell, meanwhile, has to recoup its costs and generate a profit from the initial sale. So someone who buys the Xbox hardware, modifies it into a general-purpose computer and does not buy Xbox games potentially undermines not only Microsoft but also the personal computer industry. But that is not how some Xbox hackers think about it. ''Especially in Europe, computers are more expensive than they are here, and the Xbox is the cheapest computer you can get,'' Andrew Huang, author of a new book called ''Hacking the Xbox: An Introduction to Reverse Engineering,'' said in a telephone interview. ''Basically,'' he added by e-mail, ''once you have Linux, you have everything.'' It is unclear just how many Xbox hackers there are. Officials of the Interactive Digital Software Association, a trade group of video game publishers, said that Xbox hacking appeared more prevalent in parts of Asia than in North America. Michael Steil, a 24-year-old German who is project leader of a group that calls itself the Xbox Linux Project, said by e-mail that a full version of Linux software for the Xbox had been downloaded more than 220,000 times. Whatever the numbers, Microsoft does not appear eager to discuss Xbox hacking. In recent weeks, a Microsoft public relations representative repeatedly declined to make any company executives available to discuss the matter. Instead, the company issued a statement through a public relations firm that said in part: ''Microsoft is a company passionate about innovation and creativity. We are also very committed to respect for others' intellectual property and we request the same respect applied to our innovations.'' The statement made no reference to the potential use of hacked Xbox consoles as personal computers, saying Microsoft's ''primary concern'' was with the sale of modified chips for the boxes ''that enable game counterfeiting.'' And that is the area that most clearly raises legal issues. Although there are several methods, hacking an Xbox typically involves obtaining a special chip called a modchip, available on the Internet, and soldering it into the machine. (For those who find the process daunting, there are also vendors on the Internet who sell ''pre-modded'' Xbox units.) Modchips, of which there are several varieties, allow users to load new versions of the basic computer code, known as the BIOS, that tells the machine how to operate. A hacked BIOS generally incorporates modified versions of copyrighted Microsoft code and so is generally illegal. The main Web sites that deal with Xbox hacking do not include links to hacked BIOS, and hackers generally find their forbidden fruit in Internet chat rooms. Once the modchip is installed and the BIOS modified, the console can do a number of things it cannot do ''out of the box.'' Xbox games normally must be run from an optical disk, and a hacked Xbox can ''back up'' a game to the unit's hard drive and run the game without the disk. This technique could be used simply to avoid having to insert and remove disks -- or it could be used for piracy (say, by renting a game, putting the software on the hard drive and returning the game). Until passage of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act in 1998, the mere sale of a modified chip would not have appeared illegal. That law, however, prohibits the sale of devices that are primarily meant to circumvent copyright protection. Companies and technologists will fight over the exact legal meaning of those provisions for years. For now, however, the software industry is relying on them. ''Our view over all on modchips is that they are illegal infringing devices, that where we find people engaged in the widespread manufacturing and distribution of them, we and our members, individually and collectively, are committed to doing what we can to shut down their manufacturing and go after the distributors,'' said Doug Lowenstein, president of the Interactive Digital Software Association. Some advocates, however, say that while software piracy is illegal and morally offensive, the mere act of modifying hardware should not be illegal. ''The most important dimension of this debate from our view is that people should have the right to tinker with the stuff that they own,'' said Fred von Lohmann, senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a civil-liberties group in San Francisco. ''Others will say that this is about piracy and all that, but they forget that the principle of tinkering with the stuff that you own was the principle on which the entire personal computer industry was founded,'' he added. ''This is basic business and basic science in the technology world and we think that this right to tinker, this freedom to tinker, remains legally protected.'' For now, however, the federal government seems to agree with Mr. Lowenstein. Last December, David M. Rocci, a 22-year-old from Blacksburg, Va., pleaded guilty to a federal charge of conspiring to import, market and sell modchips for the Xbox. In April, he was sentenced to five months in prison and five months of home detention. Simply from the standpoint of accessibility, the PlayStation 2 would seem to be a more likely candidate for hacking. IDG, the technology research firm, estimates that at the end of last year, 38.1 million PlayStation 2 units were in use in Europe, North America and Japan combined, compared with 6.7 million Xbox units in those regions. In one sense, however, the hacking scene for PlayStation 2 is less developed than the one for Xbox because there is less appetite for it. Sony sells an official conversion kit for the PlayStation 2 that includes a hard drive and allows that system to run the Linux operating system, which in turn allows the system to run MP3's, movies, spreadsheets or any other program or data that works under Linux. It is relatively easy for Sony to embrace Linux because Sony, unlike Microsoft, is not in the operating system business. The PlayStation 2 hacking community seems focused on developing chips that allow PlayStation 2 units to run illegal copies of games and games meant for far-flung parts of the world. (For marketing reasons, many PlayStation 2 games include regional coding, much as DVD's do.) In 2001, Sony sued an Australian for selling modchips that allowed Australian PlayStation 2 units to play games from other parts of the world. After the Australian government argued on the man's behalf, however, the Federal Court of Australia last July ruled mostly against Sony. Mr. von Lohmann said that Microsoft had not been particularly aggressive in combating Xbox hackers but that Sony had actively fought them. A Sony spokeswoman did not respond this week to requests for comment about the company's approach to hackers. For its part, Microsoft, through its public relations agency, indicated that it believed Xbox hackers were a relatively small band. ''Aside from a set of hobbyists,'' it said, ''the vast majority of Xbox owners are not focused on this niche.'' But those who are appear quite focused indeed. By e-mail, Mr. Steil, the German leader of the Xbox Linux project, declared: ''In very simple words: The Xbox is cheaper than a PC. The Xbox is a lot smaller than a PC. The Xbox looks better (next to a TV set). The Xbox is more silent. Therefore it's an ideal Linux computer in the living room.'' That was probably not the vision Mr. Gates had in mind."

                "Users of Microsoft’s popular Xbox Kinect gaming console will soon be able to use voice and motion commands to interact with advertisements while they are playing their favorite game or watching a video. On Tuesday, Microsoft is set to announce a new suite of advertising tools, called NUads, short for natural user-interface ads, that will let users interact with advertising on the console dashboard or embedded in games and other video content. The ads use the same voice and motion control developed for the company’s Kinect game console, which it introduced in time for the 2010 holiday season.  The new ads are intended to help advertisers keep the attention of Xbox users in a way that traditional television advertising does not.  “When you have highly interactive people and a passive medium, they are interacting with their phone or their laptop while watching TV,” said Mark Kroese, the general manager of the advertising business group at Microsoft. The new ads, Mr. Kroese said, “create a natural way for the user to engage with the TV.”  At least one advertising agency seems to agree.  “The new ad units really epitomized the level of engagement that everyone is working towards,” said John M. Lisko, the executive communications director of Saatchi & Saatchi Los Angeles, part of the Publicis Groupe. Mr. Lisko said the agency had successfully advertised on the Xbox console in the past and was “absolutely considering” the new capabilities. “You can text, you can tweet, you can vote,” he said. “That’s phenomenal.”  Using voice commands, gamers will be able to send messages about an ad to a social networking site like Twitter by saying “Xbox Tweet.” Advertisers who want to send more information about a product or promotion associated with a campaign can prompt Xbox users to say “Xbox More,” which will send users an e-mail with the information they wanted.  For advertising tied to events like television shows, advertisers can prompt a user to say “Xbox Schedule” and the system will send a text message reminder to the user’s mobile phone. Similarly, advertisers can prompt users to say “Xbox Near Me” and a map to the nearest retailer will be sent to their mobile phone. Finally, advertisers can prompt users to vote on a topic by asking the user to wave their hand in front of the console and select their favorite pizza topping, superhero or clothing brand.  The new advertising options will be presented on Tuesday to advertisers at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, an annual conference for advertisers and marketers. Consumers will begin to see the new features in the spring of 2012.  The new ads will be simple for marketers to deploy since they can use the same commercials they would use on television.  “What we’re seeing now is a technology environment where marketers can deliver more sophisticated ads and they don’t have some of the hurdles that in-game marketers and in-game publishers had,” said Paul Verna, a senior analyst at eMarketer. “It’s a level of interactivity that suggests more possibilities than we’ve seen up until now.” "

                "The daughter of a Brazilian Catholic mother and a Palestinian Muslim father, Fatima Shama, 39, grew up in the Bronx, attending Roman Catholic school during the week, Muslim “Sunday school” on Saturdays and church on Sundays. She speaks six languages, which comes in handy for her job as the commissioner of the Mayor’s Office of Immigrant Affairs, a position she has held since 2009. (Recently, her office reached out to immigrant communities affected by Hurricane Sandy to help them navigate government resources and aid.) She lives in Turtle Bay in Manhattan with her husband, Ziad Mansouri, 42, who works at JPMorgan Chase, and their three sons, Samir, 8; Ibrahim, 5; and Omar, 2. She and her husband are raising them as Muslims, with a generous dose of other religious traditions. WAKE-UP CALL My kids tend to wake me up — that’s about 6:30, 7 o’clock. Coffee is absolutely essential. It’s almost the first thing I do. Then we get the Sunday Times. My youngest son loves to be the person to get it for me. INTERNATIONAL BREAKFAST It could be me deciding to make Belgian waffles or pancakes, or it’s possible I’ll make — my kids love an Arabic breakfast food called lebni — basically, strained yogurt, and you eat it with pita bread. And they love an Arabic string cheese and another kind of cheese common to the region called haloumi, a must to every breakfast table in our house OUTSIDE VOICES Sundays are absolutely about family and spending time with our kids. From 11 to 2 is our outside time. We might go ice skating at Wollman Rink, or the Central Park Zoo; we are there a lot and we love it. I think that the kids would probably say the Museum of Natural History is their favorite, just ‘cause of what we get to see. It’s everything from butterflies and frogs and lizards to the dinosaurs or the elephants. And they can be loud and we don’t have to apologize to anybody. Sometimes we’ll do excursions out of the city, or there might be a children’s birthday party or two, given our kids’ social lives. PARADER IN CHIEF If it’s summertime, there’s likely a parade that I might march in or a community event I might stop by. Of course, during the hurricane, every Sunday we were out in the community. But if it’s summertime, rest assured there’s a parade in my future. BOYS’ TIME Our kids are only allowed to play their electronics on the weekends. Our kids got an Xbox for Christmas — I grew up in a dual home, so my kids have the pleasure of learning about their own faith, but also being able to celebrate the faith of my siblings and mother. The Xbox Kinect Dance Central game, I will tell you that is hysterical. I actually love the fact that this Kinect thing helps them jump around. And Sunday football is a big deal. We’re a Giants home, but my sons love the Tampa Bay Buccaneers — their mascot is a pirate, so we think that’s how it started. My oldest son can tell you anything about football. SHOPPING, COOKING I try to cook for the week or make some Sunday dinner for us, so I might run to the supermarket. I love to cook with my kids. My middle son loves to make a Brazilian cheese bread, so we make that a lot. We make black beans and rice, there’s always a pasta night — I do make, actually, a lot of Arabic food. WINDING DOWN Then it’s dinner, bath time and we do reading every night. Our kids are in bed by about 8:30. And it’s my date with “Downton Abbey.” Lady Grantham, the grandmother, I just love her absolutely dry sarcasm and her love of the monarchy and all things traditional. And I try to clean out my e-mail before Monday morning, do what I can do to make life better before Monday morning. FINISHING UP This is actually a very true thing: I basically don’t go to sleep until I finish the paper so I can put it out into the recycling bin. Otherwise it becomes a pile. I actually try to finish all of my Sunday paper and I actually read the paper — Sunday in particular — minus a couple sections, cover to cover. I love holding the paper, but I love the ads. I like to look at the jewelry ads. Even though I could never buy any of it."

                "NEW YORK — Reaching out to millions of aspiring game developers around the world, Microsoft is holding a contest that will award $10,000 and the opportunity to entice millions of viewers to the next great digital diversion for the company's Xbox 360. In addition to the game console's snazzy graphics, the Xbox Live online service has been the most important component of the Xbox 360's success since its debut in 2005. And perhaps the most popular aspect of Xbox Live has been the service's arcade component, which allows users to download and play smaller, relatively simple games like \"Uno\" and \"Geometry Wars\" that usually cost less than $10. (By contrast, top-end games can sell in stores for around $60.) The popularity of Xbox Live Arcade has in turn attracted the attention of game developers looking to create the next \"Tetris\" or \"Minesweeper.\" Late last year, Microsoft introduced a suite of software tools for making so- called casual games called XNA. So at a convention of game makers Monday in San Francisco, Microsoft was to announce a contest that will award a cash prize and a potential slot on Xbox Live Arcade to the best game created with XNA tools. The company intends to announce the winner of the \"Dream-Build-Play\" contest in August. \"This competition highlights the power of XNA and the popularity of the Xbox Live Arcade service, with its millions of users,\" Aaron Greenberg, Microsoft's group product manager for the Xbox 360 and Xbox Live, said by phone. To help increase the popularity of casual games, Microsoft is also introducing a 512-megabyte portable storage device for the Xbox 360. The previous portable storage unit contained only 64 megabytes of data, and so Xbox Live Arcade games had been limited to an official size of 50 megabytes. With the new unit, Microsoft will also raise the official size limit on Xbox Live Arcade games to 150 megabytes, allowing enhanced graphics, sound and artificial intelligence."

                "LOS ANGELES — In what may be one of the costliest consumer warranty repairs in history, Microsoft announced on Thursday that it would spend up to $1.15 billion to repair failing Xbox 360 game machine consoles. While the company would not say how many units were failing, Robbie Bach, president of Microsoft's entertainment and devices division, said that there have been an \"unacceptable high number of repairs.\" The majority of Xbox 360 owners, he said, have not experienced hardware failure. Company officials said that Microsoft had sold 11.6 million Xbox 360 units by the end of June, shy of the 12 million units the company had predicted. The Xbox 360, which first went of sale in November 2005, is currently the best-selling game machine in the United States, according to NPD, a market research firm. The size of the anticipated repair bill suggests that a third to as many as half of the machines are flawed. Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington State, said it would take a charge of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion against earnings in the quarter ended June 30. Consumers know they have a problem if three red flashing lights appear on the console. Gamers on online forums have been referring to the event as \"the Red Ring of Death\" because the machine then shuts down. The company declined to explain the nature of the failure, but said that it was not caused by a single problem in the console, which it said contained 1,700 components and 500 million transistors. The company also said there were no health or safety concerns involved. The problem began to appear over the last three to four months, Bach said, after \"significant usage\" of the consoles. He said the company has taken steps to correct the problem in new devices. Microsoft said it would extend the warranty of the game console to three years to customers worldwide. Previously, products sold in the United States were covered by a one-year warranty, while Xbox 360 units sold in Europe had a two-year warranty. In addition, customers who have had their consoles repaired because of the \"three flashing lights\" problem will be reimbursed for the cost of the repairs. Microsoft has succeeded in establishing the Xbox brand against the better known Sony PlayStation and other game machines. The Xbox and its successor, the Xbox 360, was the software maker's first major foray into hardware. Although sales are small relative to the rest of Microsoft's revenue, the Xbox has been an important venture for the company and was viewed by many analysts as Microsoft's attempt to compete with the likes of Sony and Apple for control of electronics and entertainment within homes. The device can be used to access the Internet and view movies. Microsoft said its entertainment and devices division reported an operating loss of $315 million on $929 million in revenue for the three-month period that ended in March, and analysts have estimated that the company lost about $6 billion getting a foothold in the game machine industry. A new Xbox 360 with a 20-gigabyte hard drive sells for about $400, but other versions cost about $300. The announcement comes on the eve of the E3 Media and Business Summit, the video-game industry's major trade show, to be held next week in Los Angeles. \"This is bound to affect discussions between Microsoft and its developers and retailers,\" said Richard Doherty, a partner in the research company Envisioneering Group."

                "Editors’ Note Appended Owners of Microsoft’s Xbox 360 game console will soon be able to watch science fiction epics as well as play them.  Microsoft said last night that it would offer movies and episodes of television shows for downloading through its Xbox Live online service in the United States, starting Nov. 22.  With the new offerings, Microsoft is joining cable giants and Internet start-ups on the long list of companies hoping to profit from video downloading. But Internet-based services have had trouble getting traction because it can be complex to send a downloaded film to a television screen and frustrating to watch it on the small screen of a computer. Owners of the Xbox have already connected it to a TV and, in most cases, the Internet. “What makes this big is that there’s no PC in the middle,” said Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group. Microsoft has negotiated the rights to rent or sell more than 1,000 hours of material from CBS, MTV Networks, Paramount, Warner Brothers and Turner Broadcasting, along with the martial arts show “Ultimate Fighting Championship.” Some programs will be available in high-definition video. The video store will work much like that of Apple Computer, with some important differences. While users will be able to keep television shows, movies can be rented for only a limited period. The videos will not be playable on other devices and cannot be burned onto DVDs, but the online service will keep track of purchases so that users can log in to watch their videos on a friend’s Xbox.  Peter Moore, Microsoft’s corporate vice president for interactive entertainment, said that the price of standard-definition videos would be comparable to what competitors charged. Apple’s iTunes charges $1.99 for an episode of a television program.  High-definition content will cost more, Mr. Moore said, because of the costs involved in storing it and making it available for downloading. Purchases will be made with points that users can buy with a credit card or a gift certificate, or win in contests.  Mr. Moore said the service was partly intended to make the Xbox more versatile and therefore more attractive. “Direct revenue from this over the long term could be important,” Mr. Moore said. “But this is also another reason to buy an Xbox 360.”  New game consoles from Sony and Nintendo are due out this month, a year after the Xbox 360 went on sale, so extra features could help Microsoft keep up in the marketplace. Nintendo is concentrating on game play, but Sony says it also has other content in mind.  “We haven’t announced any content besides games,” said Dave Karraker, a spokesman for Sony Computer Entertainment America, “but all the executives have said that downloading other entertainment content is something the PlayStation 3 is capable of doing.” Judging by the initial offerings, Xbox Live will be something of a cyberspace version of the Spike Channel, MTV Networks’ cable channel aimed at young men. It will sell episodes of “Star Trek,” remastered in high definition, as well as the “C.S.I.” shows, some music videos and cartoons from the Cartoon Network’s “Adult Swim.”  “The interesting thing is that we’re delivering the 18-to-34-year-olds who aren’t watching TV,” Mr. Moore said. Microsoft has sold more than two million Xbox 360 consoles in the United States, according to the NPD Group, a market research firm. Most of those who buy the machines sign up for the Xbox Live service, which requires broadband Internet access and allows users to compete against each other.  Since the introduction of the Xbox 360 last year, the service has also sold simple video games and other material. This year, Microsoft started to hint at its ambitions for the Xbox Live service when it purchased a company that places advertising in video games and made an ad deal with Cadillac.  In the last few years, Microsoft has been pushing the idea of Media Center PCs, which are meant to sit in the living room and supply music and video to the stereo and the television set. But the concept has not caught on, in part because of the complexity of setting up and using these systems.  Mr. Enderle said that apart from simplicity, another feature that would set the XBox Live service apart is that it will be the first service to sell downloadable movies in high definition, at a resolution similar to or better than a DVD.  Until now, he said, most studios have been reluctant to allow cable channels to show movies in high definition for fear of piracy, but that would be less of a threat on XBox Live.  Early next year, Apple plans to introduce a product that, on a preliminary basis, it is calling iTV and that is intended to be a bridge between the computer and the television set. But Microsoft will go into the video business with a different business model. Apple, most analysts maintain, does not make much money selling iTunes content, but makes up for that by selling more iPods, which are extremely profitable. Microsoft, which analysts say loses money on each Xbox 360 it sells, expects to make up for that by selling games — and now video.  “This is a razors-and-blades business,” Mr. Moore said. “I’ve taken the hit on the razor. And the ability of Microsoft to offer more blades gives consumers more choice and drives more revenue.”  The video downloads, especially those in high definition, will take up a lot of space. Microsoft says a one-hour television program in high definition will take up about 2 gigabytes of the console’s standard 20-gigabyte hard drive. Microsoft says the Xbox will play both movies and TV shows as they are being downloaded, although with larger files there will be a delay before playback starts, in contrast to the video-on-demand services offered by cable companies. High-definition movies will take an especially long while, depending on the speed of the Internet connection. "

                "It was nearly a decade ago that a young Microsoft programmer named J. Allard sounded the alarm and convinced Bill Gates that the Internet was a threat to the dominance of the Microsoft Windows operating system. On Monday, Microsoft will announce Mr. Allard's next big gamble: an ambitious billion-dollar-plus investment in an online game service to be called Xbox Live. Microsoft hopes to create what it describes as the equivalent of an online Disneyland, globally accessible over the Internet, where gamers who subscribe can find partners for dozens of different adventure, racing and sports games. The company is betting the service will save its Xbox video-game system, which began shipping last November but still lags far behind the industry-leading Sony PlayStation 2, which has nearly 30 million units in use worldwide, compared with only 3.5 million for the Xbox. (There are an estimated four million to five million Nintendo GameCube consoles now in use.) While Sony and Nintendo have online plans, networked game playing is peripheral to their video-game strategies. For Microsoft, it has been integral to the Xbox plan from the beginning -- the wedge with which Microsoft hopes to gain entry to the nation's and world's living rooms and become an entertainment powerhouse. It is a bet as ambitious as it is expensive. When Microsoft opens the electronic doors for its service this summer, the Internet technology in its three data centers in London, Seattle and Tokyo will have more capacity than its own Microsoft.com, which itself is one of the world's largest Web sites. The risk is that Microsoft is entering a quagmire that will soak up vast amounts of investment and lock the company in a bitter, potentially unwinnable battle with Sony and Nintendo, which will each be describing their own online services at this week's game industry convention, the Electronic Entertainment Expo, which starts Wednesday in Los Angeles. For Xbox Live to become a success the company acknowledges that it will have to attract millions of customers willing to pay $50 or more for each game's software and perhaps a $9.95 monthly subscription, in addition to the $40 to $60 a month for the high-speed Internet connection the service will require. Those are big if's, because while video games have become a wildly popular form of home entertainment, online game playing -- so far mainly employing personal computers, not game consoles -- has never appealed to more than a fraction of Internet users, and in almost all cases, only when it is free. Even more daunting is the fact that there is little evidence that video games have expanded much beyond their core audience of adolescent and college-age males. ''Gaming is a very age-specific and demographic-specific device and experience,'' said Mitchell Kertzmann, the chief executive office of Liberate Technologies, an interactive television equipment supplier based in San Carlos, Calif. There have already been well-publicized failures in the online gaming business. During the Internet bubble, start-ups like Total Entertainment Network and MPATH rose and fell on the promise of offering Web game portals for paying PC customers. And Sega, the one video-game company that did start an online service, Sega.net, way back in 2000, has dropped that service and no longer even makes game consoles, now focusing instead on software. ''It only works when you get to significantly high numbers of subscribers,'' said Lawrence Probst, chairman and chief executive officer of Electronic Arts, the largest maker of computer and video-game software. ''We've learned that the hard way with EA.com,'' he said, referring to the company's online computer-game service, whose only profitable component is the medieval-themed Ultima Online, which has about 200,000 subscribers. Another challenge may arise in household geography. In most homes, the video-game console is located in the living room, where the television set is -- nowhere near the high-speed Internet connection in the den. That assumes, of course that the den has a high-speed connection. Microsoft asserts that as many as half of its Xbox customers already have high-speed, or broadband, Internet connections. But so far only 12 percent of the nation's households have broadband Internet, according to Odyssey, a market research firm in San Francisco, and the number is growing only slowly. ''If this service requires broadband, just put it in the icebox for awhile,'' said Nick Donatiello, Odyssey's president. And yet Microsoft's new service does have its defenders, industry executives who think that online gaming can reach a broader audience than stand-alone video games have. ''Microsoft has the resources to make online gaming successful,'' said Charles Bellfield, the vice president for corporate strategy at Sega, which develops games for the Xbox and will offer versions for Xbox Live. ''It may not happen on day one, but by the time gaming reaches the mainstream, it will be doing well.'' Mr. Allard, who is now general manager of Microsoft's Xbox division, argues that Microsoft can create a mass audience by the force of a huge effort and by the company's ability to tap into a latent demand that he said he first detected three years ago. In an interview last week, Mr. Allard recalled the epiphany. While visiting a Seattle video-game arcade with other Xbox designers in 1999 he realized that the longest lines were all formed around the multiplayer games -- the basketball, car racing, tank warfare and other competitions in which players compete on individual or clustered machines. He said he came to believe that it would be the ''social'' experience offered by the Internet that would drive the next major generation of video games. That is why he committed the company to add the $40 to $50 worth of hardware to each Xbox needed to make every console Internet ready. Now Microsoft is ready to tap that built-in capability. On Monday, the company plans to announce that it will begin consumer tests of Xbox Live this summer with a one-year subscription and a headset, for $49, that will enable Xbox owners with high-speed Internet connections to compete and converse with one another online. Despite speculation that the company might use its online network connection to link Xbox users to Microsoft's other services, Mr. Allard insists that Xbox Live will stay focused on gaming. Robert J. Bach, a Microsoft senior vice president in charge of its games division said the company was planning a service that he compared to Disneyland for its safe, wholesome environment -- in contrast to the ''Coney Island'' he said that the open Internet can sometimes become. ''Compare Coney Island to Disneyland,'' he said. ''When you're at Disneyland, there's no trash, no violence and you never see security. That's what we have in mind.'' Mr. Allard invoked to the same metaphor to criticize his biggest competitor's approach. ''I won't deny that I've occasionally referred to Sony's online service as Sony Island,'' Mr. Allard said. Sony, which has said that it will begin selling a $40 adaptor for connecting the PlayStation 2 to the Internet either via dial-up modem or high-speed connection in August, makes no apologies for its approach. Although the company will not attempt to match Microsoft's ambitious online theme-park environment, neither will Sony attempt to charge users for playing its video games online -- at least not initially. If the gaming experiences are comparable for players, a free service based on Sony's market-dominating video-game console could prove an insurmountable rival to Microsoft's fee-based ''walled garden'' approach. Moreover, unlike Microsoft's command-and-control approach to the Xbox Live network, the Sony service will not force independent game publishers to provide their online PlayStation games through Sony's own network. That difference was highlighted when executives at Electronic Arts said last week that they planned an online alliance with Sony but remained unsure whether to get involved with Microsoft's XBox Live. Electronic Arts said it worried it might risk losing its customers to competing Microsoft games. Sony executives, meanwhile, questioned whether Xbox Live could ever justify itself financially. ''If I were Microsoft, I would spend my money first on selling units rather than building an online service,'' said Kazuo Hirai, the president and chief operating officer of Sony Computer Entertainment America. None of this deters Mr. Allard. Just as 3D graphics propelled growth in the last generation of video games, he said, Microsoft's ability to create a social experience will drive the next generation of gaming. ''The pendulum has swung too far in the single-user direction,'' he said. A critical component of the social experience planned for Xbox Live will be the audio headset, enabling players to cheer and jeer one another. The technology includes a ''voice masking'' feature that will conceal the identities and even ages of the contestants -- a Disneyland safeguard meant to deter adult exploitation of children online. Some analysts agree with Microsoft that voice capabilities could take video gaming to the next level. ''You're looking at a service that will become a new phone network overnight,'' said Richard Doherty, president of Envisioneering, a research and consulting firm in Seaford, N.Y. ''By Christmas, Microsoft could become the nation's fourth-largest phone company.''"

                "LOS ANGELES  Microsoft, seeking to expand offerings on its Xbox 360 console, has reached an agreement with a company headed by Peter Safran, the veteran Hollywood producer and talent manager, to produce original shows for distribution on the system. Through his Safran Company, Mr. Safran represents clients like the actor and producer Sean Combs (“Monster’s Ball”), the actor and writer Nia Vardalos (“My Big Fat Greek Wedding”) and the filmmakers Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer (“Epic Movie”). Mr. Safran founded the company in 2006 after leaving Brillstein-Grey Management. Speaking by telephone last week, Scott Nocas, global marketing manager for programming of the Xbox Live entertainment service, said he expected similar deals to follow. “We definitely look at this as the first of many,” said Mr. Nocas. In an interview at his office in Los Angeles last week, Mr. Safran said his first round of programs would all be scripted, as opposed to reality shows, and would probably run under 10 minutes. He said he planned initially to focus on genres, like comedy and horror, that appeal to the Xbox 360 audience, which is heavily concentrated from the ages of 14 to 34, and tends to be more male than female. The first shows are expected to be available to viewers by the fall. Microsoft’s previous forays in digital entertainment include a two-year-old initiative, MSN Originals, to provide original shows for the Web, and an ill-fated foray more than 10 years ago in which it poured about $100 million into Internet shows like the comedy “475 Madison,” about an advertising agency, then quickly canceled most of them. “The Xbox is unique. It operates at a level outside of what we generally consider Web entertainment,” Mr. Safran said, referring to the system’s tight demographic base, which is defined by the appeal of signature games like the Halo series.  The new shows will be available exclusively via the Xbox 360 for a time, then may appear elsewhere, Mr. Safran said. Mr. Nocas said at least some of the shows would be supported by advertising. Current programming on the Xbox 360 includes movies and selections from cable networks like the Sundance Channel and Spike TV. Viewers pay for access to films with points that can be purchased for cash or accumulated through activities on the system. Mr. Nocas said that about 10 million people had signed up for the Xbox Live service. Roughly 18 million of the game systems have been sold worldwide, he said. The Xbox 360 is up against PlayStation 3 from Sony and the Wii from Nintendo in a hotly competitive gaming marketplace. Mr. Safran is the latest in a growing line of Hollywood players who are seeking to tap into the digital entertainment market, where revenue still falls far short of that from traditional movie and television distribution outlets. Filmmakers like Joel and Ethan Coen and stars like Will Ferrell have recently become involved with Web-based companies like FunnyOrDie.com or 60Frames Entertainment. Mr. Safran and Jake Zim, chief operating officer of the Safran Company’s Safran Digital Group, said they expected to recruit established filmmakers for their new productions, but did not plan to seek involvement by major movie stars."

                "LOS ANGELES — Underscoring the importance Microsoft attaches to its video game efforts, Bill Gates has laid out a vision of a future in which gamers using the Xbox 360 console can be connected to others on a personal computer or a cellphone. The capabilities, part of an initiative called Live Anywhere, will be incorporated into the Windows Vista operating system when it goes on sale next year, he said Tuesday. \"The future is making gaming attractive to people of every age,\" he said. For Gates, Microsoft's chairman, it was the first appearance ever in connection with the Electronic Entertainment Expo, the huge annual video game trade show known as E3, which was to open on Wednesday in Los Angeles. His presence underscored the stakes in Microsoft's push to outflank the other two console makers, Sony and Nintendo. Microsoft has a head start. It introduced Xbox 360 last November, and after some initial supply constraints, 5 million to 5.5 million consoles will have been sold by the end of next month, said Peter Moore, a Microsoft vice president for interactive entertainment. He predicted sales of 10 million units by this fall, when Sony will release the PlayStation 3 and Nintendo the Wii (pronounced \"we\"). By this holiday season, Microsoft said, 160 games will be available for Xbox 360, including \"Grand Theft Auto IV,\" \"Splinter Cell: Double Agent\" and \"Forza Motorsport 2,\" for which Microsoft will sell a wireless steering wheel and headset. In addition, an external module for the Xbox 360 to play high-definition DVDs will be available by the holidays. While the PlayStation 3 will incorporate a drive for movies and games in Blu-ray, Sony's high-definition format, the Microsoft device will be used solely to play movies in a competing format, HD-DVD. With Microsoft's Live Anywhere system, game developers will be able to incorporate features that allow users to send instant messages between devices, and see if their friends are listening to music on their mobile phone or working on a PC. On certain games, players will be able to begin play on the Xbox 360, then switch to a mobile phone; they could also challenge others remotely regardless of whether they were using a PC or an Xbox 360. Sony got the week's events off to a start on Monday by announcing that the PlayStation 3 would be priced higher than expected, with versions selling for $499 and $599 - compared with $299 and $399 for the Xbox 360. At a Nintendo press event on Tuesday, there were no details about the pricing of its own new console beyond a promise from Reggie Fils-Aime, Nintendo of America's executive vice president of sales and marketing, that \"we will give you more fun for less money.\" In addition to new versions of its Zelda and Super Mario games, Nintendo also showed Wii Sports, which includes tennis, golf and Ping-Pong games designed to take advantage of the console's controller, which allows gamers to alter the action by waving it in space much like a club or baseball bat. Sony said Monday that it was incorporating motion sensors into the PlayStation 3 controller as well, but Microsoft said it was not worried by that move."

                "AS Microsoft enters the video game market with the release of its Xbox console on Thursday, some investors are placing their bets on allied companies like Flextronics, which is manufacturing the Xbox console, and Nvidia, which provides the graphics chip for the unit. To meet sales estimates of 1 million to 1.5 million game players before the end of the year, Microsoft is moving well beyond its normal marketing channels. The Xbox release includes cross-promotions with partners like Taco Bell and MTV. But even if sales reach that goal, Xbox will not ''move the needle a whole lot'' in terms of revenues for a company as big as Microsoft, said Jeff Bernstein, a portfolio manager with ING Pilgrim funds in New York. Microsoft is selling the Xbox for less than it costs to maked in the hope of eventually profiting on software development and licensing, several analysts said. But Xbox has already moved the needle on shares of Nvidia, a chip maker with a market capitalization of $7 billion. Its stock price has risen 90 percent since the beginning of 2001. It closed on Friday at $53.20. The company, based in Santa Clara, Calif., said earnings for the quarter ended Oct. 31 rose to $44.7 million, up from $28.1 million for the same period a year earlier. The company said it shipped $57.4 million worth of Xbox chips in the quarter, which counted against a $200 million advance Microsoft gave the company for initial Xbox production. ''There's a nice ramp of revenues coming from the Xbox,'' Mr. Bernstein said. Xbox revenues are expected to account for more than 10 percent of the company's revenues in 2002, a Nvidia spokesman, Derek Perez, said. Mr. Bernstein said he expected that Nvidia's earnings would push the stock price to $60 a share by mid-2002. That may not be high enough to justify an investment, he said, considering the riskiness of the video game market. ''You would have to be an aggressive investor to buy it here,'' Mr. Bernstein said. Flextronics may be a more conservative choice. Despite layoffs of about 10,000 employees in late October, or 15 percent of its work force, and a quarterly loss of $330 million, the company has weathered the technology slump relatively well, many analysts said. Because Flextronics makes telecommunications equipment, hand-held computers and a number of other electronic and computer products for a range of major companies, it is not as dependent on Xbox. ''In looking at its business, the Xbox isn't a significant percentage of Flextronics' revenues,'' said Dominic Vignola, an analyst for the Merrill Lynch Global Technology fund. ''But it has the opportunity for a deepening relationship with Microsoft.'' In the last month, Flextronics shares have risen 14 percent, but they are down 22 percent since Jan. 1. Mr. Vignola said Flextronics' business of manufacturing products for companies like Cisco Systems, Microsoft, Lucent Technologies and other major technology players should grow rapidly as those companies focus more of their resources on research and marketing. Wall Street analysts are expecting Xbox to contribute roughly $150 million a quarter to the revenues of Flextronics. Mr. Bernstein's fund is projecting 18 percent revenue growth, which, he said, could push the stock close to $40 over the next six to nine months. It closed on Friday at $22.20. BUT the estimates depend on the success of the Xbox. Ray Scanlon, a software industry analyst at Citigroup Asset Management, said that if Microsoft reaches its sales goal, the Xbox can contribute more than $2 billion of the firm's total estimated revenues of $27 billion in the 2002 fiscal year. That would still consign gaming to the second tier of Microsoft's product line in economic importance, behind the operating system and software divisions, Mr. Scanlon said. Microsoft is likely to keep investing heavily in Xbox for the next couple of years to compete with the two dominant players in the market, Sony and Nintendo, he said. But if Microsoft ever decides to abandon the venture, he said, Flextronics probably has the balance to bounce back from such a debacle better than Nvidia. ''For Flex, within a quarter or two, it could make acquisitions that would make up for or exceed what it loses with Xbox,'' Mr. Bernstein said. ''It's a conservative man's way to play the Xbox.''"

                "SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 12— Imagine your blender breaking down twice. The vacuum cleaner giving up the ghost three times. The espresso maker repeatedly going kaput. Then imagine replacing the item with the same model over and over while keeping your brand loyalty and sanity. Stephano Nevarez can. Since he first bought his $400 Microsoft Xbox 360 in 2006, it has failed three times. Each time, he sent the game machine back to the company and waited weeks for a repair or a replacement. “There’s nothing in the house that breaks down as much,” said Stephano, a 15-year-old high school student from Salem, Ore. Yet he remains a devotee of his 360 console, the more so because he wants to play Halo 3, the latest iteration of a violent space epic due in stores on Sept. 25; it is available only for that game machine.  The game, published by Microsoft, could redeem the company going into the holiday selling season. Untold numbers of 360 owners have watched their machines break down, and then, in many cases, watched the replacement consoles do the exact same thing because of a severe and widespread manufacturing flaw.  But if the Xbox players keep coming back because of Halo 3, and if other gamers buy the console just for the game, then Microsoft could markedly improve its standing in its battle against rivals Sony and Nintendo.  “Halo 3 is Microsoft’s most important game,” said Dan Hsu, editor in chief of Electronic Gaming Monthly, a magazine for enthusiasts. Mr. Hsu, who has seen the game, said it delivers in spades, with one caveat: “Assuming your machine does work, it does what it sets out to do.” The bar is high. Combined, Halo and Halo 2 have sold around 15 million units, making the series one of the most successful game franchises of all time. The game has spawned novels, comic books and a possible movie. The $12.5 billion console and video game business is up for grabs this year. On the console side, Nintendo is off to an unexpectedly strong start with its Wii, a game system that makes its players get up off the couch and move their bodies to direct action.  It has well over 28 percent of the American console market, according to NPD Group, a market analysis firm. The Wii is currently selling at a faster pace than the 360, and the company is releasing its big games this fall, Super Mario Galaxy and Super Smash Bros. Brawl, though neither is as popular as Halo.  Sony, with about 14 percent of the market, was hurt when the release date of Grand Theft Auto IV, a game it was counting on to increase console sales, was pushed back from October into the second quarter of next year.  Microsoft, which has 57 percent of the market, has declined to say what is causing some of its Xbox 360 to stop working, or how many machines have been affected. It has set aside $1.1 billion for repairs, a figure that suggests to industry analysts that the problem could affect a third of the 11.6 million 360s already in the hands of consumers. Microsoft has said that it will fix any faulty Xbox 360 free of charge. The most likely explanation of where the engineers went wrong is that the 360s are poorly designed to deal with the intense heat generated by game play and that computer chips and other electronics may be popping off the motherboard, said Richard Doherty, an analyst with the Envisioneering Group, a technology assessment and market research firm. Mr. Doherty said he thinks that Microsoft, in an effort to put is machine into the market a year ahead of the Sony PlayStation 3, had skimped on product testing. He said that the failure rate among 360s is almost unheard-of among consumer electronics, where having even 1 percent or 2 percent of machines fail is considered a major problem. He has been doing surveys of video game consumers, and results suggest that their patience is waning and that news of the problems is dissuading some potential buyers, he said. Even die-hard users, he said, are wondering why they cannot take their machine to a store to have it checked out, rather than wait for it to break. “It’s dissipating a tremendous amount of momentum they built up prior to July,” Mr. Doherty said, referring to when Microsoft first publicly discussed its $1.1 billion repair fund. “This is going to get worse before it gets better.” But some financial analysts said that the eventual damage to reputation and revenue may not be so profound. Evan Wilson, an equity analyst with Pacific Crest Securities, said he thought that Microsoft’s fix-it-free policy had mollified many avid game players who have been among the first to purchase the 360. Aaron Greenberg, group product manager for Xbox 360, said the repair campaign is aggressive and that the company, while it is not discussing what has gone wrong, is not taking the failures lightly. “It’s our equivalent of the Blue Screen of Death people talk about with Windows,” he said, referring to the derogatory vernacular used to describe what happens when a PC running Microsoft’s operating system mysteriously stops working. In the case of the Xbox 360, affected users have taken to calling the problem the Three Red Rings of Death. That’s because when the 360 dies, three lights on the front of the console blink red. “It started getting really loud,” said Michael White, 27, of Montreal, a high school teacher, who said his system died in April. “You expect somebody’s expensive product to be more durable than that.” Is he infuriated? Not really. “I’m a happy customer,” he said, given it only took three weeks to repair and he likes the games on the system. Others are feeling slightly less generous — or, at least, their spouses are. “My wife told me she didn’t want me to buy anymore Microsoft consoles,” said Joshua Bridges, an accountant in Spring, Tex. “But I told her I’m a huge fan of the games that come out for this platform.” Chief among his interests is Halo 3. He said he likes the fast-twitch action, but particularly the story, which involves soldiers battling against an alien race called the Covenant for control of a destructive force called the Halo. Halo 3 is the last in a trilogy. When it comes out on Sept. 25, the avid fans will be waiting in line at video game retailers across the country. More than one million units have already been ordered.  For the last three years, a team of 250 full-time and part-time designers and engineers at Bungie Studios, the development house that is owned by Microsoft, have been assembling Halo 3, said Frank O’Connor, the game’s head writer. (He declined to say how much money they spent on the game). Developers felt enormous pressure, he said, and he hopes this version will be the most popular ever, particularly given new features, like the ability of players to record and make short movies of the action they just played. “Instead of being able to say: remember the time I did that one thing? Now they’ll be able to save it and show it,” Mr. O’Connor said. One question is whether it can help Microsoft sell more consoles to mainstream consumers, or to those who may be concerned about the reliability of the 360 systems. But there is little doubt the faithful will be there in force, and thrilled about it, having forgiven Microsoft for the flaws in its console. “I’m on my third 360,” said Benjamin Lin, an 18-year-old Halo enthusiast from Seattle, “and it’s working great for me.”"

                "Ethan Thomas is an F.B.I. agent hunting serial killers and Kameo is a princess who must save her family, but both have a much more important objective: to persuade gamers to spend $300 on Microsoft's new game console, the Xbox 360. Ethan and Kameo are among the first wave of video-game protagonists for the 360. Ethan stars in Monolith's action-horror game Condemned: Criminal Origins as a G-man on the trail of the man who framed him for murder. The search has Ethan creeping, flashlight in hand, through a series of abandoned buildings populated by violent junkies and, later on, humanoid creatures that skitter along the ground. To survive you have to improvise weapons, arming yourself with a mannequin arm, a piece of steam pipe or the blade from a paper cutter, although from time to time you find a handy fire ax or even a gun loaded with a handful of bullets. Your attackers are smart, hiding behind pillars to ambush you. You can paralyze one with your Taser and grab his weapon, but your foe will immediately rearm by pulling a pipe off a wall or grabbing a table leg. Combat is well done and exciting, but other parts of the game are annoying. The biggest aggravation is locating specific weapons to get through doors; an ax breaks through a wooden door, but only a shovel can snap open the lock on a metal gate. Movement is slow; you can sprint short distances but generally are forced to walk, which creates tension when you enter a room but is infuriating when you just want to quickly run through the halls to find a shovel. To make things worse, by default sprinting is initiated by the awkward method of pushing the left analog stick on the controller, although you can assign sprint to the left trigger, which then forces you to use the left analog stick for blocking attacks. Someone should be hit a couple of times in the head with a mannequin arm for that decision. Like Monolith's recent shooter F.E.A.R., Condemned has an intriguing premise that completely falls apart by the end, but while the game's designers should consider taking a few writing classes, they really know how to scare people. It is wonderfully creepy to walk through a deserted, ruined shopping mall as Christmas Muzak endlessly plays. The game is also creepy in another way; you spend much of it essentially beating homeless people to death with pipes. Admittedly, these people attack you, and in fact will often attack and kill one another if you just get out of their way, but I still found it disturbing. Depicting homeless junkies as subhuman monsters unsettles me, although this is less of an issue later in the game as your enemies become increasingly grotesque. It is less disquieting to battle the trolls and rock creatures that populate Rare's considerably lighter action-adventure game Kameo: Elements of Power, in which the titular hero is able to transform herself into a variety of useful creatures. After her family is kidnapped by a troll king in league with her evil sister, Kameo's rescue attempt ends abruptly with the loss of the elemental powers that allow her to transform. The powers, each represented by a cute creature held captive by a shadow demon, must be freed one by one. With each rescue Kameo gains the ability to become that creature and use its powers to access new areas of the game. As the yetilike beast Chilla she can climb ice walls, while as a living ball called Major Ruin she can roll up ramps. Kameo can also use special, hard-to-find flowers to upgrade her creature's powers; the dragon Ash proved extremely useful in battles after I gained the power to release fire tornadoes to suck in enemies. Kameo is generally enjoyable but hampered by awkward controls; it is difficult to aim projectiles, and the underwater levels in which you must use Kameo's aquatic incarnation Deep Blue are utterly painful as you laboriously try to steer through the water and desperately try to aim water missiles in the right direction. The game also has an incredibly annoying help system. The hints it gives are useful, but the game won't shut up about them. As you play, a voice constantly repeats that help is available, as if even after being told the first 100 times the designers were convinced you would forget. You can make the voice shut up by turning off hints, but then when you need help you have to go into options and turn hints on, then turn them off again after, so you don't have to listen to the game blather on. Kameo is most notable for its gorgeously rendered graphics. The 360's processing power allows for many nice visual effects and lets the game put an amazing number of objects on screen. It is stunning the first time the camera pulls back from a troll battle to show what seem to be thousands of soldiers grappling. Kameo is among the most graphically advanced console games on the market, yet I was considerably more entranced this month by Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King, a turn-based role-playing game developed by Level 5 for the aging PlayStation 2 console. With a simple, pastoral cartoon style reminiscent of the films of Hayao Miyazaki and a lovely symphonic score, Dragon has a low-key charm and humor that trump cutting-edge graphics. Dragon is the episodic tale of a band of adventurers searching for the evil sorcerer Dhoulmagus. Following reports of the sorcerer, they travel from town to town, along the way helping the occasional distressed stranger. As with any role-playing game, most of your time is spent fighting off random monster attacks. Enemies tend to be more goofy than frightening; and you will face cat monsters that occasionally stop attacking to lick themselves, or giant frogs that turn around to reveal that their backsides are long-tongued demonic faces that attack by licking. Your party fights with weapons and magic, although each member can learn some other interesting skills. One female character can stop a monster from attacking by throwing a kiss, paralyzing it with desire. There's nothing especially original in Dragon's old-fashioned gameplay, but it does it all beautifully. The game also works hard to root out the most annoying traits of role-playing games. Unlike games in which you spend an hour fighting monsters, gaining better weaponry and skills only to die in a big battle and lose all your progress, in this game the death of everyone in your party simply results in the loss of some gold and your return to the nearest town. The game offers shortcuts to previously visited locales and a way to exit dungeons instantly. Dragon has witty dialogue, interesting characters and engaging battles, yet for me it is perhaps most notable for being one of the least annoying role-playing games ever made. Dragon proves that, while the 360 is a beautiful machine whose elegant design and raw power easily best the competition, you don't really need it. If you have an Xbox 360, Kameo and Condemned are both worth playing, but neither is essential. Great games come when game designers know a platform well enough to concentrate on their vision rather than the technology, so expect the best 360 games to turn up in a few years. Just around the time Microsoft comes out with a brand-new console.

                "The transition to a new generation of video game consoles kicks off tonight at midnight when retailers begin selling Microsoft's Xbox 360. The event is a much-anticipated step in an intensifying business battle between Microsoft, a relative newcomer to the video game industry, and Sony and Nintendo. Sony plans to release its own successor console, PlayStation 3, in the spring, while Nintendo is expected to follow later in 2006. The new consoles are, in general, considerably more powerful than their predecessors, but they will be more expensive, as will the games made to be played on them. The high-end version of the Xbox 360 is priced at $399 and the basic version at $299, though some enthusiasts are not blinking. \"I'll be there at midnight,\" said Ibe Ozobia Jr., 31, who said he planned to pick up his new Xbox at a local retailer in Las Vegas, where he lives. Mr. Ozobia placed an advance order for the console in June, making sure he would not miss out if there is a shortage. And, he said, he likes to be on the cutting edge. \"I can't deal with old technology,\" said Mr. Ozobia, who works in technical support at a computer company and spends 30 hours a week playing video games. For Microsoft, the challenge is whether it can build its base of consumers beyond the hard-core game players that supported the first version of the Xbox, which came out in 2001. A key to Microsoft's success is whether there will be enough mainstream video games to attract a range of consumers to the console, industry analysts said. Analysts have said it is too soon to say whether that is the case, though they consider the number of games available at the outset, 18, to be relatively healthy. Some Wall Street analysts said they were puzzled by the question of how many consoles would be immediately available for sale. Microsoft has declined to comment about its supply, leaving analysts to estimate that there are two million to three million to be distributed in North America, Europe and Japan. Sales in Europe begin on Dec. 3, and in Japan on Dec. 10. Microsoft has said that within 90 days, it expects to ship 2.75 million to 3 million consoles worldwide. Wall Street analysts expect a shortage in the United States, with some saying Microsoft has purposely stoked demand beyond the company's ability to meet it. Indeed, some stores have already sold out their allotment through advance orders and Internet sales. GameStop, the nation's biggest video game specialty retailer with 3,500 stores, sold out its initial order two weeks ago. Individual stores have been calling consumers, telling them to show up within 48 hours of the introduction or risk forfeiting their console and receiving a refund, said Chris Olivera, a GameStop spokesman. Microsoft is \"trying to turn this into the Cabbage Patch Kids,\" said Michael Pachter, an analyst with Wedbush Morgan Securities. He said he expected Microsoft to constantly publicize stories of stores that were sold out to inspire press coverage and water-cooler talk of when the next shipment would arrive. \"It's brilliant marketing.\" Molly O'Donnell, a Microsoft spokeswoman, said the company was not trying to pique demand by holding down supply or withholding inventory from retailers. \"The reality is that our manufacturing facilities are running at full capacity and churning out as many consoles as humanly possible,\" Ms. O'Donnell said."

                "LOS ANGELES — The latest video game consoles can play Internet radio, Netflix movies and YouTube video clips. But Sony and Microsoft, gearing up for a blistering battle in retail stores this holiday season, are reassuring consumers that their consoles are very much about games, too. That message was particularly forceful from Microsoft at the annual Electronic Entertainment Expo, or E3, game convention here, where the biggest companies in the games business show many of the products they will release later in the year. A year ago, Microsoft was promoting its Xbox One as an all-in-one entertainment system for the living room, one that could play games and then seamlessly shift to let people watch television, and change the channels with voice commands. On Monday, though, Microsoft shifted the conversation decisively back to games, announcing a lineup of almost two dozen titles, many of them hard-core shooting games, to be released on the Xbox this year, including an anthology of classic games based on the Halo science-fiction shooter series. “Our goal is to make Xbox One the best place to play games in this generation,” said Phil Spencer, the head of Microsoft’s Xbox business, who received vigorous applause when he declared that Microsoft would dedicate the event entirely to games. While the change in emphasis may seem subtle, it comes after Microsoft was forced to respond to the success of Sony, its main competitor in the games business. Both companies introduced their new game systems in November, but Sony’s PlayStation 4 has held a decisive lead on Microsoft from the beginning. Microsoft said Monday that the company has sold more than five million Xbox Ones. Last month, Sony said it has sold more than seven million PlayStation 4s. At its own event Monday evening, Sony revealed its own slate of upcoming games for the PlayStation 4, including Little Big Planet 3, a new version of a popular adventure game with a character called Sackboy. Sony also said Grand Theft Auto V, a huge hit released previously for older consoles, will be released on the PlayStation 4 in the fall. It will also be published for Xbox One and PCs. Andrew House, the president and chief executive of Sony Computer Entertainment, said the company’s vision is to make sure that its console is “above all else the place to play.” But Sony placed a spotlight on its broader entertainment ambitions, too. The company said it would produce original television content that will be streamed over the Internet to its console, including a show based on “Powers,” a graphic novel about two homicide detectives who investigate superheroes. Microsoft has announced similar plans for original shows. Sony has also sought to out-innovate Microsoft with plans, announced previously, to develop a virtual reality headset, called Project Morpheus, that will immerse PlayStation 4 players in 3-D worlds. Part of Microsoft’s disadvantage came from being more ambitious about the technology in the Xbox One, which includes the Kinect camera and microphone device. The Kinect allows people to play games and operate other functions with body movements and voice commands, and has been included with the console. The extra technology translated into a $499 price tag for the Xbox One, $100 more than for the PlayStation 4. Sony deftly exploited that and other missteps by Microsoft to portray itself as the more gamer-friendly console maker. In response, Microsoft recently announced it planned to introduce a $399 console without Kinect, which went on sale Monday. “They’re back on message,” said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, referring to the change in Microsoft’s emphasis. Game developers still seem eager to create products for Microsoft’s system. The company and its partners showed new versions of “Assassin’s Creed” and “Call of Duty,” two blockbuster franchises that are likely to be big sellers this holiday season. One of the most enthusiastic responses Microsoft got was for the Halo anthology, “Halo: The Masterchief Collection,” which will allow people to play four older installments of the series on the Xbox One console with improved graphics. Microsoft will not release an entirely new version of Halo, known as “Halo 5: Guardians,” until next year. But Microsoft said people purchasing the anthology would be able to participate in a test of the multiplayer abilities of the new game later this year. Microsoft showed another exclusive Xbox game called “Sunset Overdrive,” a kinetic shooting game set in an apocalyptic urban landscape populated by mutants. Sony and Microsoft have both enjoyed strong sales of their new systems, partly because a third competitor, Nintendo, has struggled with its latest console, the Wii U. All three are being forced to adapt to a market where smartphones and tablets are becoming the most common devices for playing games. In an interview, Mr. Spencer of Microsoft commended Sony for its strong showing since it introduced the PlayStation 4. He said he had no intention of allowing his competitor to keep a lead on Microsoft. “I’m in this to win,” he said."

                "Josh Roberts got his first video game system — Atari — when he was 4, and since then, “I’ve had all the latest and greatest systems,” said Mr. Roberts, 27, an advertising account executive. The roster includes various versions of Nintendo, Sega and Sony PlayStation, the original Microsoft Xbox and now its latest iteration, Xbox 360.   Last year when Mr. Roberts moved with his wife from Los Angeles to Memphis, he didn’t have cable for several months. So he began using his Xbox 360 for something more than his standard fare of games like Guitar Hero II and Madden NFL: he downloaded episodes of his beloved “South Park” as well as the occasional movie in high definition, for fees running from $2 to $6 through Xbox LIVE Marketplace, the emporium accessed through the console’s interface.  “I’ll sometimes also look and see what the top downloads are and check them out too,” he said.   With the continued rise of video gaming — sales of the Xbox 360 have hit 10 million — consumers in that highly prized demographic of males from 18 to 24 are being drawn away from the entertainment provided by the small screen and the multiplex. To bring them back to the fold — and to compete with Apple’s iTunes — Microsoft and its content providers, among them Paramount Pictures, New Line, Warner Brothers, MTV, CBS, A&E and ABC are engaged in some serious outreach.  “We need to find viewers wherever they are,” said Michele Ganeless, the executive vice president and general manager of Comedy Central. “Some of them are firing up their Xbox rather than their cable box. They have so many entertainment options. Being on Xbox is a perfect way for us to reach them in their own environment.”  Since late last November, through the console interface and a points card available in $5 increments from chains like Best Buy, Xbox LIVE Marketplace has offered video-on-demand downloads of movies, often in high definition, and download-to-own episodes of television shows. Microsoft declined to give revenue figures for the service, but claims it has grown by double-digit figures each month since it was introduced. Membership at the basic level is free and as simple as signing up on iTunes.  “We allow a consumer who’s very engaged in games to shift, with the same box, to watching ‘The Departed,’ ” said Ross Honey, senior director of the media entertainment group at Microsoft, referring to Martin Scorsese’s Oscar-winning movie.   Xbox LIVE Marketplace also has some exclusive content, for example, a no-cost high-definition version of a “South Park” episode and some first-look content. Before “The Sarah Silverman Program” appeared on Comedy Central, the first episode was available free in the Marketplace.  There’s a similar plan in place for “American Body Shop,” a series that begins on Comedy Central on July 8; starting yesterday, its premiere episode was available for free download to Xbox LIVE’s more than six million members.   The service currently offers more than 2,000 hours of programming. To prevent piracy, consumers have 24 hours to watch rented material before it is automatically expunged from the console’s hard drive.   “The people we’ve partnered with see this as a good way to re-connect with the consumer,” said Mr. Honey.  For example, the high-definition “South Park” episode which has, thus far, been downloaded almost 400,000 times, contained a message urging viewers to watch for the series’ new season. Warner Brothers promoted the theatrical release of the film “300” on the Marketplace interface.   “We’ve seen tremendous results,” said Michele Edelman, vice president of marketing for Warner Brothers digital distribution whose offerings include current television shows like “Supernatural” and “One Tree Hill,” classic fare like “CHiPs” “The Dukes of Hazzard,” “Scooby Doo” “Yogi Bear,” as well as movies.  And some platforms encourage their own hits. When Warner released “Beerfest” to the rental market, the gross-out comedy became the No. 1 offering on the VOD Xbox platform, according to Ms. Edelman.  “It might be buried in a video store, and on Xbox it’s been able to rise to the top,” she said.  The visual sophistication of gamers is such that they are largely unsatisfied by traditional television broadcasts, said James L. McQuivey, a principal analyst at Forrester Research. “It’s very smart of Microsoft to realize, ‘We’ve got the customers, we already have an Internet connection for millions of boxes, let’s see what other visual treats we can feed them.’ ”  Mr. McQuivey added, “From all the data I’ve seen behind closed doors, it does work.”   What is good for Xbox’s best consumer, the young male gaming enthusiast, Mr. Honey hopes will be good for other segments of the population.  The goal is to broaden the consumer base with younger offerings like Nickelodeon’s animated series “Fairly OddParents.” According to Mr. Honey, Microsoft did a brisk business with a high-definition version of “Happy Feet” when a few weeks ago it was added to the offerings on the service.  “We absolutely believe that ‘Happy Feet’ being available brought families to use Xbox in a way they haven’t used it before,” he said. “And when you bring them there, they start to browse around.”  Indeed, Mr. Roberts of Memphis says that although his wife does not play video games at all, “the movie and TV service on ‘Live’ has her using the Xbox. Because of the service she knows how to navigate the user interface to download the content she wants.”   Anita Frazier, an industry analyst for the NPD Group, a sales and marketing research firm, says Xbox’s expansion of services makes sense.  “It’s where entertainment delivery is headed. It’s a natural evolution for any of these boxes, whether it’s a computer or an Xbox or a PlayStation 3 or Apple TV to deliver a variety of content and whether it’s games or music or TV or movies.”  But, she added, “a lot of it is going to hinge on the user interface and how easy it is to accomplish the downloads.” Not always so easy, according to Mr. McQuivey. “The movie feature as currently arranged is no better than traditional video on demand. The titles are hard to find,” he said, adding, “There are operational things that need to be resolved before they can take it to the next level.”   Mr. Roberts has downloaded a few high-definition movies and “it took hours,” he said. “I don’t think the broadband technology is there yet.” He also finds the Microsoft points card (80 points equals one dollar) an annoying and slightly confusing system.  “It’s like at a carnival where you need two tickets to buy a drink and three tickets to buy a hot dog,” he said. “I’d rather know what I’m paying, and I’d like to see that transaction made in dollars rather than points.”   Xbox LIVE Marketplace, he added, “is not yet at a place where I think it’s made my life easier or more entertaining in my leisure time, but I’m excited for the potential. When it moves faster and the bandwidth is great, then I think it will be very cool.”"

                "There are few places online not full of advertising, but Xbox Live, the Microsoft broadband network that lets Xbox game console owners compete online, is one of them. This week Cadillac will announce that it has struck an advertising deal to incorporate some of its cars in the Xbox 360 game, Project Gotham Racing 3. Virtual recreations of three of its high-performance models -- the CTS-V, the STS-V and the XLR-V -- will be made available as free downloads. Deals like this also represent another source of revenue for video games, many of which now have the online connectivity that can allow advertisers to monitor the viewership of their messages. Cadillac is one of the first companies to advertise on Xbox Live. But Kevin Browne, the Microsoft general manager for Xbox new media and franchise development, said that the company expected to announce between 10 and 20 such deals over the next year. Earlier this month, Microsoft announced that it had acquired Massive, a company that sells ads in games. The Cadillac deal was put together by Play, the video game unit of Denuo, a division of the ad giant Publicis Group that focuses on new media. \"It's another model to distribute advertising,\" said Michael Goodman, a senior analyst at the Yankee Group. He said that the market for advertising in video games was $56 million in 2005, a number he expected to triple this year. For years, racing video games have incorporated increasingly accurate representations of actual cars, which are able to accelerate and handle on the screen the way they do on the road. Software makers usually pay a royalty for the right to use a vehicle's likeness, even though inclusion in a popular game can generate a certain amount of awareness in the young, male audience. In Project Gotham, players who score top times on the Nürburgring, a race track in Germany that Cadillac has used to test vehicles, will receive a \"Cadillac Elite\" status to show off to fellow gamers and perhaps eventually use to receive other prizes. \"But it would be a mistake to capitalize on this space without taking advantage of it,\" said Saneel Radia, a group director of Play. \"The fact that other people are looking at it creates an aspirational value for Cadillac.\" ROBERT LEVINE"

                "AMONG other new features, the new Toyota Yaris has a giant tentacle that reaches out of its roof to shoot enemies as it races through a futuristic tunnel, sometimes within inches of soaring fireballs. The tentacle is not standard on the new models: this Yaris car was devised by a video game company rather than automobile engineers.  The shooting car is the central character of a new Xbox game called Yaris that Toyota will introduce today. The game will be offered free to all Xbox 360 console owners in the United States and Canada, who can download it from Xbox Live’s service. It is also the first Xbox game created by an advertiser to be distributed over Xbox Live.  Like scores of other consumer brand companies, Toyota is increasingly creating its own content like video games rather than relying simply on advertising during commercial breaks. “People can time shift, they can do all sorts of different things to avoid advertising,” said Kim McCullough, corporate manager for marketing communications at Toyota. “That’s why we have to move beyond traditional advertising to do things that are really engaging for people.” Toyota introduced the Yaris, a moderately priced subcompact, in the spring of 2006, and has focused its advertising on young consumers. Yaris is not the first brand to advertise through custom-made video games.  Two years ago, Volvo introduced an Xbox game that emphasizes safe driving; it was given away at dealerships. Doritos ran a contest (www.unlockxbox.com) this summer for Xbox game ideas, and the top five ideas are being produced by professionals.  Advertisers are also increasingly buying product placement space within games rather than creating their own. Advertisers in the United States will spend $502 million on video game advertising this year, up from $346 million last year, according to eMarketer, a research firm. Just over half of that is in the form of ads placed within games, and the rest is for marketers to create their own games, known in the industry as advergames. Advertisers generally view video game fans as people who are hard to reach and do not like commercial messages, said Shahid Khan, a partner at IBB Consulting Group, a media consulting firm. “This group does not want to be advertised to,” Mr. Khan said. “It has to be a really good game. If it is a really good video game, then it won’t matter if it was made by an advertiser.” Of course, advertisers might have trouble competing with the popularity of Xbox games like Halo 3, which was released last month. Within a week, Microsoft announced that the game had more than $300 million in sales, a high level for any game.  Burger King’s Sneak King Xbox game introduced last fall has become perhaps the most well-known advergame. Customers can buy the game for $3.99 at Burger King restaurants (with the purchase of a BK value meal). About 3.5 million games have been sold, according to Burger King. Using Xbox data on game use, the Burger King game equates in time spent to more than 1.4 billion 30-second commercials, the fast-food company says. “Interacting with our characters in the games is actually more engaging than just sitting back in your chair and watching a Super Bowl commercial,” said Russ Klein, president for global marketing for Burger King.  Mr. Klein cautioned that giving a game away, as Toyota is doing, might cause people to be suspicious of the game’s quality. Games in the Xbox Live Arcade section, where the Yaris game will be available, normally cost $5 to $15 a download.  The idea and game design for the Yaris game came from Toyota’s advertising agency, Saatchi & Saatchi L.A., which outsourced production to Backbone Entertainment, a division of Foundation 9 Entertainment. Backbone is perhaps best known for creating the Sonic the Hedgehog games. Toyota is spending in the low millions for the campaign, which includes paying Microsoft to promote it and developing the game at a cost higher than typical casual games. “The level of finish on this is really polished. It had to be,” said Harvey Marco, executive creative director at Saatchi & Saatchi L.A., which is part of the Publicis Groupe. “It’s not overt branding. It’s called the Yaris game, it’s about driving the Yaris around, but we’re not coming out and throwing taglines into the game.” Past campaigns for the Yaris have also centered on emerging technologies. Yaris sponsored short cellphone episodes of Fox’s “Prison Break” last year and ran ads in the game Anarchy Online. Players earned “power-up” points in the game by watching Yaris ads on billboards. "

                "Rockstar Games, maker of the wildly popular and highly controversial Grand Theft Auto series of video games, right, announced yesterday that a new installment of the series is in development for Microsoft's Xbox 360 game console and Sony's PlayStation 3. The announcement came one day before the world's largest video-game convention, known as E3, opens in Los Angeles. As gamers and industry executives from around the globe have descended on Los Angeles, the potential development of a new Grand Theft Auto has been widely rumored, yet yesterday's confirmation is sure to become one of the main topics of discussion on the show floor. (But it appears unlikely that Rockstar will demonstrate any elements of the game at the convention.) The announcement was a blow to Sony because previous versions of Grand Theft Auto have had their debuts exclusively on PlayStation 2, which has helped sell the Sony machines. This time, Rockstar is making Grand Theft Auto for the Xbox 360 simultaneously with the Sony version. In addition, Peter Moore, corporate vice president for Microsoft's games business, announced at Microsoft's E3 news conference that Rockstar would be making add-ons for Grand Theft Auto IV available by download over Microsoft's Xbox Live service. The game is to arrive in October 2007. SETH SCHIESEL"

                "SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 22 - Around 2:30 a.m. Tuesday, Mike La was scoping out a darkened Target store in nearby Daly City, Calif., on his Honda motorcycle when a police officer pulled up. The officer knew exactly what was going on. \"He asked, 'Are you here to buy an Xbox 360?' \" Mr. La, 23, recalled later. When Mr. La said that was his intention, the officer pointed him to another part of the building where a line of customers waited for the store to open. The much-publicized transition to the next generation of video game consoles began Tuesday morning as stores across the country started selling Microsoft's Xbox 360, the powerful new machine that is already the must-have of the season for hard-core game players. They gathered in the rain in Manhattan, where a Best Buy opened its doors at midnight. They stood in line all night at chain stores like Target. Mr. La, a car salesman in San Francisco, had preordered one Xbox 360 from a local EB Games store, which he picked up at midnight. Then he waited in line to buy a second one at a nearby CompUSA store, after deciding not to wait at the Target. He said he was hoping that stores would sell out of their initial supplies and he could make a profit selling his second machine. \"I think I can get at least $800 for it,\" Mr. La said of the system, which costs $399 in stores. Microsoft has declined to say how many consoles it is making available this holiday season. But it has said that it expects to have shipped 2.75 million to 3 million units within 90 days. The excitement among hard-core gamers, partly generated by the limited supply, is precisely what Microsoft is hoping for as it tries to build momentum in the bruising game console business, which has been dominated by Sony. Microsoft expects the Xbox 360 to provide serious competition to Sony's next-generation console, the PlayStation 3, which is due out next spring. Industry analysts and executives said the early buzz around the Xbox 360 might not mean much in the long term. Analysts have widely expected Microsoft to sell out its early, limited supplies of the console, but to eventually sell 10 million of them with relative ease. The real question for Microsoft is whether the 360 can outsell the first version of the Xbox, which came out in 2001 and has sold about 22 million worldwide, compared with about 90 million for PlayStation 2 Paul-Jon McNealy, a video game industry analyst with American Technology Research, said the real measures of Microsoft's success might not be clear until the 2007 holiday season. At that point, he said both Microsoft and PlayStation 3 will have been in the market for more than a year, and will be vying head-to-head for mainstream game players. Evan Wilson, an analyst for Pacific Crest Securities, said the long-term measure of success would depend on whether there were any big hit games for the Xbox 360 that succeeded in drawing mainstream consumers to the console. For customers on Tuesday, the long term did not matter. \"I wanted to be one of the first, if not the first, to have the Xbox 360,\" said Peter Gonzalez, 19, a sophomore at the College of Staten Island, who was the first in line at a Best Buy in Manhattan. He had arrived at 7:30 p.m. on Sunday night and by the time the store opened, he was shivering under an umbrella in the rain. But he said he was elated, and even got a cheer from employees after he made his purchase and left the store. Anthony Cintron, 26, was feeling less buoyant. He arrived in line at 6 a.m. Monday, and by the evening he was feeling cold, wet and under-appreciated. \"My wife thinks I'm nuts and my kids are sleeping,\" said Mr. Cintron, an employee at an elevator business in Long Island City, Queens. \"My feet hurt, I'm cold, but it's worth it.\" For Mr. La, in San Francisco, the results were mixed. He said he felt good about owning the new console, and was optimistic about selling the second one at a profit. But there was just one small downside: after playing Perfect Dark, a shooting game, for about 30 minutes, he concluded the machine was not quite as much fun as he had hoped. \"There was too much hype,\" he said."

                "A video game that depicts a battle between corporate mercenaries and local brigands in far-off space colonies has already won the hearts and minds of Microsoft executives. Now those Microsoft bosses hope the game, Titanfall, will win over enough consumers to pump up sales of Xbox One, the company’s flagship gaming console. Xbox One sales are trailing those of a machine from Sony, Microsoft’s main rival. There is reason to be hopeful: Titanfall was created by a well-known game designer and has already received critical acclaim. In an unusual move for a major title created by an independent game maker, Titanfall is being released exclusively for three Microsoft platforms — the Xbox One, the older Xbox 360 console and Windows PCs. “It’s hard to understate how incredibly important Titanfall is for Xbox,” Yusuf Mehdi, chief marketing and strategy officer for devices and studios at Microsoft, said in an interview. While the Xbox is a relatively small portion of Microsoft’s business, it is crucial to the company’s future as its most prominent hardware success and the linchpin of its strategy to influence the future of entertainment. Microsoft is betting that an exciting game that can be played only on Microsoft products will persuade more people to spend $500 on an Xbox One, $100 more than for Sony’s latest console, the PlayStation 4. In a sign of how heavily Microsoft is counting on Titanfall to lift the sales of its new console, the company said recently that it would bundle the game with the Xbox One while keeping the price for the two at $500, the same amount it previously charged for the console alone. The move was effectively a $60 price cut for the Xbox One since that it is how much Titanfall will sell for on its own. Price is the biggest disadvantage Microsoft has against the PS4. Microsoft’s console costs more because it includes the Kinect camera and microphone sensor with every system. The sensor is designed to let people play games without a conventional controller and to operate nongame functions on the console, like changing cable channels with their voices. Titanfall is due in stores this week after two years of development.  Early reviews have been positive, and its creative chief, Vince Zampella of Respawn Entertainment, has a strong track record. He helped create the wildly successful Call of Duty game series, which has had revenue of more than $9 billion during its 11-year history. If the game is the hit many people in the industry expect, Titanfall could repeat the success of another big game, Halo. That science-fiction shooter, which is owned and still published by Microsoft, ignited a fire under sales of the original Xbox. Since Halo was released in 2001, more than 60 million copies have been sold. As another science-fiction shooting game, Titanfall resembles Halo, at least superficially. But Respawn has put a fresh spin on the concept. And as inexpensive mobile games soak up more time from players, the game is also an opportunity for a big-budget console game, with eye-popping effects and a monopoly over the biggest screen in the house, to reassert itself and its genre. “Titanfall will help propel the idea of high-definition gaming,” said Patrick Soderlund, the executive vice president of EA Studios at Electronic Arts, the company that is publishing the game for Respawn. Titanfall is meant to be played only online with other players, in contrast to other modern games that allow people to play both online and by themselves. This dovetails well with Microsoft’s strategy of giving people more reasons to subscribe to a premium version of Xbox Live, a paid service that is required for people who want to play games against others online. Microsoft is using Xbox Live, which costs $60 a year, to deliver video programming from Netflix, Comcast and a bounty of other media partners. People can play Titanfall as soldiers on foot, outfitted with a variety of weapons that they use to defend themselves amid the ruins of a ravaged planet.  They can leap across chasms by running on walls, parkour style. The most exciting moments occur when players decide to hop into giant robotic suits, known in the game as titans, which they can pilot around, picking off opponents with heavy weaponry. “It was a little bit of trying to do something familiar yet different,” Mr. Zampella of Respawn said. The high hopes for Titanfall stem partly from the pedigree of Mr. Zampella, 44, and Jason West, the co-founders of Infinity Ward, the studio behind Call of Duty, which Activision acquired in 2003. They were forced out of the studio by Activision in 2010 in a dispute over money. Lawsuits between both sides were eventually settled. Respawn, based in Van Nuys, Calif., has about 70 game developers, about half of whom used to work at Infinity Ward, Mr. Zampella said. Mr. West, who co-founded Respawn with Mr. Zampella, left the studio last year. In deciding to make Titanfall exclusive for Microsoft systems, Respawn and Electronic Arts are probably forgoing the opportunity to sell millions of copies of the game for PlayStation. The benefits of their deal, whose financial terms Mr. Zampella, EA and Microsoft declined to disclose, are widely believed to include hefty financial contributions by Microsoft to develop the game. “Microsoft is going to push us because they see us as a game for selling their system,” Mr. Zampella said. Still, Microsoft has to persuade gamers that the Xbox One is worth the extra cost. The first wave of games after the system went on sale in November did not fully showcase the benefits of the Kinect, and Titanfall will not either, since it does not rely on the sensor for any central elements of the game. “There are a lot of people who don’t understand what Kinect is all about,” said John Taylor, an analyst who follows game industry stocks at Arcadia Investment. Sony also deftly exploited some marketing missteps Microsoft made when it announced its console last year, including a decision to give game publishers control over whether people could sell Xbox One games on the used market. Microsoft reversed the decision after a huge outcry from gamers. But by then, Sony had used the controversy to portray itself as the more gamer-friendly system. As of March 2, Sony says consumers have bought more than six million PlayStation 4s globally. The most recent Xbox One sales figure Microsoft has provided was 3.9 million through the end of last year, though not all of those systems were bought by consumers since the figure represents Microsoft’s sales to retailers. In January, the PlayStation 4 outsold the Xbox One in the United States almost two to one, Sony said recently, citing data from the NPD Group, a retail sales tracking firm. “It’s very early in the race, but the danger is if PS4 just keeps building momentum, that could cause them a lot of trouble,” David Cole, a game analyst at DFC Intelligence, said of Microsoft. “The next nine months are really critical for Xbox One. Titanfall is huge in that respect.”"

                " NEW YORK — Microsoft said on Thursday that its second-quarter profit rose 5.5 percent, buoyed by new server software, but that revenue missed forecasts after sales of the video-game console Xbox 360fell short. Net income advanced to $3.65 billion, or 34 cents a share, from $3.46 billion, or 32 cents, a year earlier, the company said. Sales gained 9.4 percent, to $11.8 billion, missing its October forecast of $11.9 billion to $12 billion. The company shipped 1.5 million Xbox machines in the quarter.The Xbox sold out days after it went on sale on Nov. 22 in the United States after a failure to secure Xbox components limited supply. The company had pinned its hopes on holiday sales of the machines to bolster revenue and win market share from PlayStation, which is made by Sony. \"Xbox does have a material impact for Microsoft in the December quarter because of the holiday shopping season,\" said David Hilal, an analyst at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey. \"The fact it was capacity constrained in December will probably create some headwinds for their overall quarter.\" Sales also missed the $12 billion average estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial. Shares of Microsoft, which reported after the close of trading,rose 10 cents to $26.50. Revenue this quarter will be $10.9 billion to $11.2 billion, Microsoft said. Per-share earnings will be 32 cents to 33 cents. The new Windows and Office, coming this year, will anchor plans by Steve Ballmer, the company's chief executive, to buttress sales growth and win back investors who say Microsoft Google in the hottest markets such as Internet search. Profit was bolstered by rising personal-computer demand. Global PC shipments rose 17 percent in the quarter, according to the researcher IDC. That beat company forecasts of a 10 percent to 12 percent rise. Microsoft's sales may pick up in coming quarters with the release of Windows Vista, which will have new features like a built-in search engine for scouring the Web and files on PCs, and an application to organize and display photos. Nokia profit falls Nokia, the world's largest maker of mobile phones, on Thursday reported an unexpected drop in fourth-quarter profit and said cellphone prices might fall. The company also said it planned to buy back E6.5 billion worth of stock this year, Bloomberg News reported from Helsinki. Net income fell to E1.07 billion, or $1.3 billion, from E1.08 billion a year earlier. Earnings per share rose to 25 cents from 24 cents as the company bought back stock. Sales increased to E10.3 billion from E9.46 billion, Nokia's chief executive, Jorma Ollila, said at a press meeting in Espoo, Finland, where Nokia is based. Ollila, who plans to step down on June 1, announced the company's biggest-ever share buyback, underpinning a stock that fell as much as 5.1 percent after the results. Nokia said handset prices, which dropped 11 percent last year, might fall this quarter as sales increase in emerging markets. Ollila will be succeeded this year by the company's president, Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo. Jarmo Nieminen, a fund manager at Nordea in Helsinki, said that \"margins and average selling prices lagged expectations\" as the volume growth is in China and India. The forecast for phone prices \"was a disappointment, as expectations were for an increase,\" he said. Nokia is trying to lift sales and margins by selling more advanced phones in Europe and the United States and luring buyers in growth markets like India and China. Shares of Nokia fell 23 cents, or 1.5 percent, to E14.89 in Helsinki. Nokia was expected to earn E1.09 billion on sales of E10.07 billion, the median forecast of 17 analysts in a Bloomberg News survey showed. The company plans to pay a dividend of 37 cents a share for 2005, up from 33 cents a year earlier, it said in a Helsinki exchange statement. Average selling prices fell to E99 in the fourth quarter, from E102 in the preceding three months and E111 a year earlier, Nokia said. Prices will be \"flat to slightly down sequentially\" in the first quarter, Nokia said. Richard Windsor, an analyst at Nomura International in London, said that Nokia's forecast that prices may drop this quarter \"is negative, given that they have a strong product line-up.\" "

                "I went to the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last week for two main reasons: to speak on a panel about next-generation gaming and to see if Sony would say anything substantive about the PlayStation 3. The panel was over by the end of my first morning in town. By the end of the second morning -- after Sony's news conference and a speech by Sir Howard Stringer, its chairman -- it was clear that the company was intent on saying absolutely nothing significant about the PS3. (So by default, the prevailing assumption for now has to be that North American gamers won't see the machine before November; Japan will get first dibs.) The rest of the show didn't have a lot of video-game content. And so, faced with two more days before my flight out, I went looking for what so many have sought in Sin City: sex. And that's because gadget geeks aren't the only folks who have their major annual get-together in Las Vegas during the first week of January. Quite symbiotically, it seems, the multibillion-dollar sex entertainment industry stages the flashy Adult Video News Adult Entertainment Expo at the same time. That got me thinking about the debate that erupted last year when it was discovered that Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas included hidden scenes, playable only with special software, that used relatively low-resolution graphics to depict mostly clothed digital figures rubbing against each other in sexlike poses. That revelation not only made news across the country, but also propelled Democratic senators, led by Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, to introduce legislation that would have the Federal Trade Commission regulate video game sales. With sex in video games such a hot topic, I figured that the professional pornographers must be working on some pretty-far-out game projects. And so, with the full consent of my girlfriend, I went in search of the latest video games with sexual content. The first thing I realized was that there still aren't any true \"adult\" video games, as the industry calls them. By that I mean that I have never seen a product that worked primarily as an engaging video game while also incorporating X-rated content in an interesting way. Even as far back as the 1980's, the really good games with risqué themes, like the Leisure Suit Larry series and the text-only Infocom classic Leather Goddesses of Phobos, had very little actual sex in them. Instead, they relied on humor and innuendo. On the other hand, almost all sex-oriented games have just been straight-up pornography strung together with a veneer of interactivity. As far back as junior high school in the 80's, I can remember strip poker games for my Commodore computers that amounted to barely decipherable digital pictures of topless women with a few card-flipping animations thrown in. Twenty years later, the graphics and presentation are a lot better, but the idea is still mostly the same. For example, one of the highest-profile interactive products in Las Vegas last week was a DVD called Virtual Blackjack with Gina Lynn, due out this month. Evan Brimstone, the project's producer, said he worked for 18 months trying to shoehorn a playable blackjack system onto a DVD. As the player wins hands, Ms. Lynn performs various explicit scenes. The challenge facing the industry is that for any video game to break through, it really has to deliver on the game part. Otherwise, the player might as well go straight for the hardcore stuff readily available all over the Internet. Ms. Lynn seemed to perfectly grasp that the play, not the sex, is the thing. \"With a movie they don't have to work for it,\" she said, stepping away from an autograph session with fans. \"But in the game you don't get to see anything unless you win. With a game they feel like they accomplished something and they win a prize, and the prize is me. They can watch any movie just to see sex. But with a game they get to feel like they've won, and hopefully that keeps them playing.\" In the end, though, most of the games out there with sexual content are still just a matter of picking a path to follow. It is a problem familiar to Joone, founder of Digital Playground, a leader in interactive pornography since the early 1990's. Digital Playground started the popular Virtual Sex DVD series, which has included big-name porn stars like Jenna Jameson, Tera Patrick and Jill Kelly, and is now beginning to stream explicit clips to video iPod users. \"When the DVD came out it actually became harder to achieve the interactivity because with the DVD you couldn't save,\" said Joone, who uses only one name. \"You could switch camera angles and you could switch positions, but you couldn't save your experience and play it back.\" Now, with high-definition movie formats like HD-DVD and Blu-ray on the way, Joone said he hoped that the industry could create new interactive features that allowed users both to create and to save their preferred path through a film or scene. But why no real video games with sexual content on real video game systems? In the end, it is mostly because the big-name console makers are afraid of the potential backlash. While anyone can make and sell a PC game, selling a game for a living-room console requires approval from the system's manufacturer. \"We thought we would be building bigger, more sophisticated games by now like you see on PlayStation and Xbox,\" Joone said, \"but the problem is that Sony and Microsoft are the gatekeepers and they don't want it. Also, we know a lot of users would like our content on a PSP, but Sony controls that and they say that if it's hard core it's not going on the PSP. You can do soft core only.\" But despite all the warmed-over concepts, there were a few flashes of real creativity. The most interesting project I saw was a demonstration of a massively multiplayer online game called Naughty America: The Game. The graphics, which looked a lot like the Sims game, were nothing special, but the concept was fascinating: to bring together gaming and online dating. Dusty Lillo, a Naughty America spokesman, said the game was not meant for immediate sexual gratification. \"This is for people who want to form relationships,\" he said. \"This is for people who want to explore their fantasies.\" \"In World of Warcraft, you go up in levels, gain power and add equipment,\" he added. \"In our game, you add prestige by having sex with more people. But you can't tell other people who you had sex with unless both parties agree to share that information publicly.\" Mr. Lillo said the game, which is scheduled to go into online beta testing this spring, will include a strong identity-verification system. And he joined the politicians and others who have denounced Grand Theft Auto. \"Grand Theft Auto is marketed to children, and in that game you can beat women without their consent and that is unacceptable,\" he said. \"In our game you can't have sex with someone unless it's consensual. In our game, if someone doesn't like what you're doing, they can tell you to stop.\" \"Previous games with sex involved artificial intelligence, but who wants to have sex with an artificial intelligence, with a machine?\" Mr. Lillo added. \"People don't want to play games anymore unless they know there are real people on the other end. What we're doing is using a game system as the bridge to online dating. Most online dating now is on Web sites, and Web sites are so static. This is an interactive environment with a game component that lets people, men and women, actually meet each other and explore their fantasies consensually before exchanging any personal information.\" Don't be surprised if the idea works. Sex sells. Online gaming sells. Online dating sells. If Naughty America can meld the three into a workable system, perhaps then there will be an \"adult\" video game. As usual, responses are invited to thegamer@nytimes.com."

                " SAN FRANCISCO — Note to hard-core video game players: Microsoft says it is aiming for your mothers and wives. In the coming weeks, Microsoft plans to introduce a marketing campaign to expand the appeal of the new Xbox 360 game console beyond the young men who are the Xbox's biggest fans. Microsoft hopes to win a bigger share of the market from the PlayStation 2, the top-selling console made by Sony, by promoting a more family-friendly image for the new Xbox, which will be in U.S. stores starting Nov. 22.The Xbox 360 will go on sale Dec. 2 in Europe and Dec. 10 in Japan, Microsoft has said. In 2001, when Microsoft introduced the first Xbox, it focused heavily on hard-core gamers, typically males age 17 to 24 , who wanted a high-end machine with more sophisticated graphics and more complex game functions. The PlayStation and the Nintendo GameCube, meanwhile, put more emphasis on reaching the mainstream market, analysts said. This time, Microsoft is planning a wider attack. Brochures going out to major retailers like Best Buy prominently describe the 360's ability to double as a DVD player, play music from an MP3 player through a television's speakers and even display digital photos on a TV. Its game functions, while impressive, are now only part of the message. The point, said Bill Nielsen, who oversees marketing for the Xbox 360, is to help a game player convince the women in the family that \"this is for you, too,\" The brochure even says, \"Here are some things you might want to tell your wife this thing does.\" Over Labor Day weekend, Microsoft and Pepsi began a radio promotion to give away 9,000 Xbox 360s by Nov. 22. Nielsen said those ads were meant not just to reach hard-core gamers, but their mothers. The Pepsi promotion \"also hits moms,\" Nielsen said, because \"moms make a lot of the final decisions\" on whether the family buys a new game console. Microsoft will also try to showcase more family-oriented games that can be played on the 360. The Xbox has long depended on the popularity of games like Halo, a shooting game, for console sales. But with the new machine, it will promote games like Kameo, an action-adventure game for younger teenagers, including girls. Industry analysts, however, are skeptical that the repositioning will work. They say it will be difficult to alter the Xbox's high-end image. And they point out that nongame features have not sold consoles in the past. The Xbox, like the PlayStation 2, can work as a DVD player, but most users do not use game consoles as substitutes for a stand-alone DVD player, analysts said. \"It's a tough sell\" to market the 360 to a mainstream audience, said Jeff Gerstmann, senior editor at GameSpot, an online gaming review site. \"It's icing on the cake - being able to view photos on an Xbox,\" Gerstmann said. \"But first and foremost this thing will always be viewed as a game machine.\" The biggest challenge in expanding the Xbox's reach, analysts say, is making available more games for mainstream players. Evan Wilson, a video game industry analyst with Pacific Crest Securities, said that even to redefine the Xbox as a multimedia console Microsoft would have to first produce more general-interest games. That will not happen in the next few months. Nielsen said most of the titles available for the holiday season would be sports and shooting games that appeal to the young male market. And the bulk of the initial advertising will be aimed at hard-core gamers willing to pay $299 for a base model or $399 for a model with add-ons like a wireless controller. Still, Nielsen said he was confident that family-friendly marketing could help redefine the Xbox's image as more games of broader appeal become available. The first week of November, Microsoft will begin a TV campaign with commercials on programs with a larger male audience, including many on the Fox network. The campaign will also include print ads in video game trade publications, Internet spots and heavy advertising at movie theaters. Last week, the company announced a partnership with Adidas to put Xbox game kiosks in Adidas stores. Nielsen declined to say how much the company planned to spend over all on its campaign. The early indications are that demand for the Xbox will be strong. Online preorders have been so high that some retailers now take preorders only for bundled packages, which include several games. The Web site of GameStop, for example, offers an Xbox bundle for $699, which includes five games and an extra controller. The stakes are high for Microsoft. Sony and Nintendo plan to introduce new consoles next year. In the game wars, the PlayStation 2 has sold 30 million units; the GameCube has sold around 10 million; and the Xbox has sold 13 million in North America, according to the NPD Group, a market research company. Wilson of Pacific Crest said he expected Microsoft to make two million to three million Xbox 360s available, but demand could well be greater. A shortage might even benefit Microsoft, he said, by attracting attention well into 2006. \"They want to keep interest high all the way through the launch of PlayStation 3,\" Wilson said. "

                "XBOX, the video game console that Microsoft introduced nearly 14 months ago, is technologically sophisticated and, by many accounts, the best way to play games against competitors over the Internet. But the advantages have not translated into the returns Microsoft had hoped for. It has sold nine million Xbox consoles, on the low end of its projections; it continues to lose money on each one it sells; and it remains desperately behind Sony, whose PlayStation 2 is selling at a record pace. Wall Street analysts have mixed opinions about whether Microsoft's early effort has been successful, but they agree that it has a way to go. Avid game players like Brian Green, 26, who spends hours each week on both consoles, have a simple explanation for why Microsoft has yet to make the inroads it sought. ''The Xbox is cool,'' he said, ''but the PlayStation is where the games are at.'' That is not good news for Microsoft, because people tend to buy electronics based on the amount of software they can use. Sony learned that lesson two decades ago, when its technically superior Betamax video recorders were swamped by VHS machines that had more tapes available. Makers of video games are starting to produce more games for Xbox, but the 2-to-1 gap with PlayStation will take some time to close. And while Microsoft, which has more than $40 billion in cash on hand, can afford to be patient, analysts and investors wonder how much time and money it is willing to invest before it starts to turn a profit. The issue is of no small significance. The market for consoles and video games is worth more than $9 billion a year. Even while losing on selling consoles, Microsoft could still make a lot of money from game makers. They pay the console makers about $10 for each copy of the games they manufacture -- and they made well in excess of 50 million games in the United States last year. Games typically sell at retail for $50. For now, though, there are only losses for Microsoft. It declines to say how much it loses on each console, but industry analysts estimate the figure at close to $100. Sony, by contrast, does not sell PlayStation 2's below cost. Part of Microsoft's problem is the ambitious design of Xbox: its chipsets and other electronic components are more expensive than those of the PlayStation. Microsoft has also been unable to realize certain economies of scale because sales have not been as robust as expected. Joseph Osha, a semiconductor analyst at Merrill Lynch who follows Nvidia, a company that makes the graphics processing chips for the Xbox, said Microsoft had had to ''pull back sharply'' on its orders. He estimated that Microsoft had 1 million to 1.5 million unsold Xbox chipsets, which are the brains used in Xbox consoles. Microsoft is too big to have its stock price move significantly on sales of Xbox. But the effect of all that idle Xbox inventory is evident on its profit-and-loss statement. In a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Microsoft said its home and entertainment segment, which includes the Xbox and television divisions, lost $348 million in its most recent quarter on sales of $1.28 billion. In the period a year earlier, the home and entertainment unit lost $180 million on sales of $833 million. On a micro level, investors ''don't like it because they lose money on every piece of hardware they sell,'' said Michael P. Wallace, a video game industry analyst at UBS Warburg. But, he added, ''on a macro level, they're in the No. 2 spot.'' In addition to overtaking Nintendo, which makes the GameCube console, as the second-place console maker, Microsoft has put itself in a position to compete with Sony for years to come, Mr. Wallace said. When Microsoft introduced the Xbox in January 2001, it promised to put $2 billion into the product -- $500 million in advertising alone. It may well need to spend it all. In 2002, according to UBS Warburg, Sony sold 18.3 million PlayStation 2 consoles, while Microsoft sold 5.2 million Xbox machines and Nintendo sold 4.7 million GameCubes. These figures reflect consoles sold to consumers, not consoles that the manufacturers ship to wholesalers or retailers. THE good news for Microsoft is that industry experts expect it to widen its lead over Nintendo this year. Electronic Arts, the world's largest game maker, is projecting that in North America in 2003, Sony will sell 9 million to 10 million PlayStation 2's, Microsoft will sell 2.5 million to 3 million Xbox consoles and Nintendo will sell 2 million to 2.5 million machines. Electronic Arts also projects that Microsoft will beat Nintendo in Europe, the second-biggest market after the United States. Still, Microsoft is particularly struggling in Japan, where it has been virtually shut out of the market, selling a mere 300,000 consoles, according to the company. Throughout all of Asia, Microsoft has sold only 500,000 Xbox consoles, according to UBS Warburg, compared with Sony's sales of 3.67 million PlayStation 2's. Microsoft officials say they are hampered in Asia because Sony and Nintendo, both Japanese companies, have entrenched positions and great control over distribution and sales channels there. But industry analysts say Microsoft should come up with more than excuses. ''If Xbox has any chance of closing the gap against PlayStation, Microsoft is going to need a better Japanese strategy,'' said Michael Gartenberg, an analyst at Jupiter Research. He said it needed to have better games and to burrow into the Japanese distribution channel. Microsoft said it was already making progress on games, introducing in Japan a game called DOA Xtreme Beach Volleyball. The 80,000 games sold out within two days. Robert J. Bach, a senior vice president for the home and entertainment division, acknowledged that the Xbox was continuing to lose money, but he said that such losses were natural with a new business. A better picture of the situation, he said, is how the company is performing relative to its business plan. ''We're doing very well on that basis,'' he said. Analysts said Microsoft must also persuade video game makers to produce versions of their products for the Xbox. According to figures provided by Microsoft but compiled by NPD Funworld, an industry research group, there are 458 games available for the PlayStation 2, versus 207 for the Xbox and 168 for the Nintendo GameCube. Microsoft faces a chicken-and-egg problem: makers of video games won't make versions of their games for a given console unless the machine has a wide installed base, but it is hard to build a base without a lot of games. Some big game makers have made versions only for the PlayStation 2. Most notable has been Grand Theft Auto, the most popular game the last two years. Microsoft said it is in discussions with the game's maker, Take Two Interactive, to persuade it to produce a version for the Xbox. Xbox also suffers because video game publishers will sometimes release a PlayStation 2 version of a game first, then deliver an Xbox version months later. That happened last year with Medal of Honor, a top-selling game from Electronic Arts that came out some six months earlier on the PlayStation 2. Jeff Brown, a spokesman for Electronic Arts, said, however, that the company was increasingly releasing games concurrently for the two platforms. Industry analysts like Mr. Wallace of UBS Warburg said Microsoft needed to find video game makers that would produce hit titles exclusively for its console. To bolster its game portfolio, Microsoft has been in discussions to buy Vivendi Universal Games. Microsoft would not comment on the issue. In the meantime, Microsoft has quietly begun to make inroads with a feature that cuts across individual games: Xbox Live. This is a $50 attachment that lets console owners play games against one another over the Internet. Microsoft, citing figures from NPD Funworld, said it sold 350,000 Xbox Live kits since introducing the service in November. Sony has sold 438,000 of its own online kit, said Microsoft, citing NPD Funworld figures, but Sony has been selling its kit for almost twice as long, since August. Mr. Bach said that these kinds of numbers showed that Microsoft, by sticking to its plan, could succeed, and he has said so to Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates, and its chief executive, Steven A. Ballmer. ''In the conversations I have with Bill and Steve, they want to know where we are on that plan,'' he said. ''We're on that plan.'' The question is whether Brian Green and other gamers are on board, too."

                "WASHINGTON — In late January, as China locked down some provinces to contain the spread of the coronavirus, average internet speeds in the country slowed as people who were stuck inside went online more and clogged the networks. In Hubei Province, the epicenter of infections, mobile broadband speeds fell by more than half. In mid-February, when the virus hit Italy, Germany and Spain, internet speeds in those countries also began to deteriorate. And last week, as a wave of stay-at-home orders rolled out across the United States, the average time it took to download videos, emails and documents increased as broadband speeds declined 4.9 percent from the previous week, according to Ookla, a broadband speed testing service. Median download speeds dropped 38 percent in San Jose, Calif., and 24 percent in New York, according to Broadband Now, a consumer broadband research site. Quarantines around the world have made people more reliant on the internet to communicate, work, learn and stay entertained. But as the use of YouTube, Netflix, Zoom videoconferencing, Facebook calls and videogaming has surged to new highs, the stress on internet infrastructure is starting to show in Europe and the United States — and the traffic is probably far from its peak. “This is totally unprecedented,” said Thierry Breton, a European Union commissioner who oversees digital policy and was a chief executive of France Télécom. “We have to be proactive.” To head off problems, European regulators like Mr. Breton have pushed streaming companies such as Netflix and YouTube to reduce the size of their video files so they don’t take up as much bandwidth. In the United States, regulators have given wireless carriers access to more spectrum to bolster the capacity of their networks. Some tech companies have responded to the call to ease internet traffic. YouTube, which is owned by Google, said this week that it would reduce the quality of its videos from high to standard definition across the globe. Disney delayed the start of its Disney Plus streaming service in France by two weeks, and Microsoft’s Xbox asked gaming companies to introduce online updates and new releases only at certain times to prevent network congestion. “We really don’t know how long we’re going to be in this mode for,” Dave Temkin, Netflix’s vice president of network and systems infrastructure, said in a webinar on Wednesday on how the coronavirus could affect internet infrastructure. Internet service providers like Comcast, Vodafone, Verizon and Telefónica have been building out their networks for years to account for increasing demand. But company officials said they had never seen such a steep, sudden surge. Growth that the industry had expected to take a year is happening over days, said Enrique Blanco, the chief technology officer at Telefónica, a Spanish telecommunications company. “In just two days we grew all the traffic we had planned for 2020,” Mr. Blanco said. On Monday, traffic on AT&T’s networks was up 27 percent compared to the same day last month, and last week Verizon experienced a 22 percent increase in traffic on its wireless and fiber broadband service. Wi-Fi calls doubled from their normal volume, the carriers said. In Europe, internet traffic into homes over fixed lines was up more than 30 percent, according to Telefónica. Activities like online gaming and video conferencing have more than doubled, while messages over WhatsApp have more than quadrupled. So much traffic and stress on internet networks has slowed the speed of downloading web pages and apps, according to Ookla. “Congestion is higher,” said Adriane Blum, an Ookla spokeswoman. “We’re all at home, and the activities we’re doing in this unprecedented time are not low-bandwidth usage, which means a lot of activity on a network.” Cisco said demand for its WebEx teleconference service had tracked the spread of the coronavirus. Demand first surged in Asia, then in Europe, and last week it soared 240 percent in the United States. The demand has pushed up failure rates delivering video conferencing, said Sri Srinivasan, a Cisco senior vice president in charge of WebEx. “I don’t know if we’ll soon see a peak, not for weeks to come,” he said. “The reason I say that is because we aren’t seeing traffic in Asia slow down even now.” Internet service providers said they could handle the deluge of traffic but were adding capacity. Verizon, Cox and AT&T said they were building more cell sites to strengthen mobile networks, increasing the number of fiber connections on their network backbones, and upgrading the routing and switching technology that lets devices talk to one another and share an internet connection. Orange, formerly France Télécom, has doubled its capacity inside undersea internet cables. In Italy, where home internet use is up 90 percent, Telecom Italia said its technicians continued to make repairs and add capacity. Vodafone, one of Europe’s largest networks operators, said it had increased its capacity 50 percent in recent weeks through a mix of software and the addition of more equipment in the field. “We’re seeing some signs of stress,” AT&T’s chief executive, Randall Stephenson, said in an interview on CNN on Sunday. “We’re having to go out and do some augmentation of networks, and so we’re sending our employees out there to get that done, but right now the network is performing quite well.” To prevent clogged networks, Europe has taken the most aggressive steps. Last week, Mr. Breton, the European Union commissioner, discussed reducing the bitstreams of videos with Reed Hastings, the chief executive of Netflix; Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Google; and Susan Wojcicki, the head of YouTube. The companies agreed, as did Amazon for its Prime Video streaming service and Twitch, its online gaming platform. Many of the companies then went further. On Tuesday, Netflix decided to switch its high-definition video streams in India, Australia and Latin America to slightly lower quality to reduce the traffic they create there by 25 percent, and YouTube said it would make all global streams standard definition. “We continue to work closely with governments and network operators around the globe to do our part to minimize stress on the system during this unprecedented situation,” YouTube said in a statement. Microsoft’s Xbox gaming business recently asked large gaming companies to release online updates of their games during off-peak hours while it helped focus on the critical internet needs of people involved in the coronavirus crisis, according to an Xbox email reviewed by The New York Times. Video game updates can require great amounts of bandwidth to download. Xbox asked the companies to release updates in a four-hour overnight window in North America, and only from Monday through Thursday. “Microsoft is actively monitoring performance and usage trends to ensure we’re optimizing service for our customers worldwide, and accommodating new growth and demand,” the company said. “At the same time, these are unprecedented times, and we’re also taking proactive steps to plan for these high-usage periods.” While U.S. regulators said they did not plan to follow Europe in asking for streaming and social media companies to degrade their services, they are taking other steps. Last week, the Federal Communications Commission granted Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile temporary access to more airwaves. “The F.C.C. has been coordinating closely with network operators to ensure those networks remain up and running,” Ajit Pai, the agency’s chairman, said in a statement. Telefónica’s Mr. Blanco, who has been living under a lockdown in Spain, said he expected the record traffic to last for some time. It may even become the new normal, he said. In Spain, internet use drops only at 8 p.m., when people across the country go to their windows to cheer health workers and others who are helping to manage the crisis. “Suddenly at 8 p.m. it goes down, then it goes back up,” Mr. Blanco said. “It’s a beautiful thing.” Cecilia Kang reported from Washington, Davey Alba from New York and Adam Satariano from London.

                "The last time I was unemployed was in the depths of the Great Recession. I had recently moved in with my girlfriend, who suddenly found herself with an out-of-work partner who rarely left the house. But she gave me some surprising advice: Play video games. I would have a lot of time on my hands, she said, and while I could and should certainly do other things — housework, exercise, searching for a job — I would mostly be stuck at home with limited resources. Without something to occupy my mind, I’d go crazy. She was right. Playing video games helped ease my mind, elevate my mood and possibly saved our relationship. This year we’ll celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary. So now I’m going to give the same advice to anyone who is now out of work, or otherwise kept at home: Play video games. And don’t feel bad about it. If you’re not a gamer, you might think of video games as simple time-wasters. But for those stuck mostly inside without work, killing time is a real problem. And in the world of big-budget console games, 10 to 15 hours is a fairly short experience. Some can take hundreds of hours to complete. There are online games designed to be played and replayed for thousands of hours. But games are more than just empty time-wasters. In periods of pain, boredom or personal emptiness, video games can serve as palliative care for both the body and the mind. Think of gaming as a personal stimulus plan for a nation of unexpected shut-ins: It’s not a long-term solution, it won’t work for everyone, and it won’t solve the underlying problems — but it can provide limited, temporary relief for some. Video games take many forms, but they are all essentially simulations. And when the real world is temporarily unavailable, a simulated version might be what we need. Among other things, video games simulate work: Even the simplest games give players tasks, objectives, lists of things they have to do, problems to solve and a sense of accomplishment upon completion. And the biggest modern games offer seemingly endless lists of quests and objectives, tasks and subtasks, systems to learn and skills to be mastered. A game like the online shooter Destiny 2 offers hundreds, if not thousands, of hours of play, exploration and study. Set in an intricately designed sci-fi world, it tasks players with taking out wave after wave of alien enemies. It also rewards them for understanding a complex character progression system that involves completing ever-more-difficult goals and objectives, sometimes multiple times, in exchange for rarer and more powerful weapons and armor. You might not actually accomplish anything after a day spent checking off quests and gathering virtual materials, but you’ll feel like you did. Game critics have noted the worklike nature of many modern games for years, not always favorably. But in a world of stay-at-home mass unemployment, even the illusion of accomplishment is probably better than none at all. Indeed, the particular shut-in nature of our current crisis makes video games unusually relevant in a different way: What video games do better than any other medium is simulate places. Open-world games like Skyrim, Red Dead Redemption II or The Witcher 3 are built around giant, explorable spaces, sometimes the virtual equivalent of hundreds of square miles, with elaborate geography and shifting weather. They can take days or weeks to fully explore and at their best can be unexpectedly beautiful, offering the opportunity to encounter animated versions of sun-dappled vistas or foggy mountain peaks, to wander through crowded city streets or stroll past others on well-trod footpaths. Games can give us someplace else to go. That makes games useful in another way. Some of us are shut in alone. But especially in cities, many are now effectively trapped inside modest apartments with family or roommates, and little private space. Games offer a form of personal escape, a way to simulate being elsewhere from the confines of your couch. And for those who are alone, games can also serve as social spaces, virtual fields of play for cooperative adventures or competitive contests. Many of today’s most popular games are online experiences that allow players to engage with friends as well as strangers, to forge digital versions of the same sort of bonds with teammates that can develop in the real world. If you’re new at this, the cost of entry is fairly low: There are thousands of high-quality games available for phones, and many more available to download directly to your computer. Even better, many big-budget games are free if you have a computer or game console on which to play them. Late last year, Destiny 2, released in 2017 as a full-priced game, reinvented itself as a free-to-play experience, with the base game available at no cost (players can pay for expansions). Several of the “battle royale” games that have defined the new wave of first-person shooters are also free: A relatively well-reviewed recent entry, Call of Duty: Warzone, offers several clever twists on the popular last-player-standing formula. Not everyone wants to play online shooters, but for those willing to spend a little there are now subscription services that offer access to a large library of games for an annual or monthly fee. For little more than the price of a standard Netflix plan, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate offers access to dozens of games, from moody, philosophical puzzle games like The Talos Principle to richly animated platformers like Ori and the Will of the Wisps. There are sports games, strategy games, role-playing games and simple twitchy diversions that recall the arcade games I pumped quarters into as a kid. And for those who not satisfied with our current quasi-apocalypse, there even games about viral outbreaks and attacks, from the strategic epidemic simulator Plague Inc., to the deftly scripted post-pandemic action game The Last of Us, to The Division 2, a military thriller set in emptied-out recreations of downtown Washington and New York after a viral bioweapon wipes out most of the population. Maybe that one hits a little too close to home. Yes, games are frivolous. Yes, they are escapist. But the longer the coronavirus keeps social life and culture in isolation, the more we’ll need frivolity and escapism. There’s a limit, of course, to what video games can do: They can’t serve as long-term substitutes for real places, real work or real human interaction. But they can give us a simulacrum of all those things at a time when the real ones are in short supply, and tide us over until the world we actually need returns.

                "Like many young hipsters in Austin, Tex., Michael Burns wanted to make it big in some creative field -- perhaps writing comedy scripts in Hollywood. Instead, he wound up in a dead-end job, managing a call center. To kill time, he made friends with a group of equally clever and bored young men at the company where he worked, and they'd sit around talking about their shared passion: video games. Their favorite title was Halo, a best-selling Xbox game in which players control armor-clad soldiers as they wander through gorgeous coastal forests and grim military bunkers and fight an army of lizardlike aliens. Burns and his gang especially loved the \"team versus team\" mode, which is like a digital version of paint ball: instead of fighting aliens, players hook their Xboxes to the Internet, then log on together in a single game, at which point they assemble into two teams -- red-armored soldiers versus blue-armored ones. Instead of shooting aliens, they try to slaughter one another, using grenades, machine guns and death rays. On evenings and weekends, Burns and his friends would cluster around their TV's until the wee hours of the morning, gleefully blowing one another to pieces. \"Halo is like crack,\" Burns recalls thinking. \"I could play it until I die.\" Whenever a friend discovered a particularly cool stunt inside Halo -- for example, obliterating an enemy with a new type of grenade toss -- Burns would record a video of the stunt for posterity. (His friend would perform the move after Burns had run a video cord from his TV to his computer, so he could save it onto his hard drive.) Then he'd post the video on a Web site to show other gamers how the trick was done. To make the videos funnier, sometimes Burns would pull out a microphone and record a comedic voice-over, using video-editing software to make it appear as if the helmeted soldier himself were doing the talking. Then one day he realized that the videos he was making were essentially computer-animated movies, almost like miniature emulations of \"Finding Nemo\" or \"The Incredibles.\" He was using the game to function like a personal Pixar studio. He wondered: Could he use it to create an actual movie or TV series? Burns's group decided to give it a shot. They gathered around the Xbox at Burns's apartment, manipulating their soldiers like tiny virtual actors, bobbing their heads to look as if they were deep in conversation. Burns wrote sharp, sardonic scripts for them to perform. He created a comedy series called \"Red vs. Blue,\" a sort of sci-fi version of \"M*A*S*H.\" In \"Red vs. Blue,\" the soldiers rarely do any fighting; they just stand around insulting one another and musing over the absurdities of war, sounding less like patriotic warriors than like bored, clever video-store clerks. The first 10-minute episode opened with a scene set in Halo's bleakest desert canyon. Two red soldiers stood on their base, peering at two blue soldiers far off in the distance, and traded quips that sounded almost like a slacker disquisition on Iraq: Red Soldier: \"Why are we out here? Far as I can tell, it's just a box canyon in the middle of nowhere, with no way in or out. And the only reason we set up a red base here is because they have a blue base there. And the only reason they have a blue base over there is because we have a red base here.\" When they were done, they posted the episode on their Web site (surreptitiously hosted on computers at work). They figured maybe a few hundred people would see it and get a chuckle or two. Instead, \"Red vs. Blue\" became an instant runaway hit on geek blogs, and within a single day, 20,000 people stampeded to the Web site to download the file. The avalanche of traffic crashed the company server. \"My boss came into the office and was like, 'What the hell is going on?' \" Burns recalls. \"I looked over at the server, and it was going blink, blink, blink.\" Thrilled, Burns and his crew quickly cranked out another video, then another. They kept up a weekly production schedule, and after a few months, \"Red vs. Blue\" had, like some dystopian version of \"Friends,\" become a piece of appointment viewing. Nearly a million people were downloading each episode every Friday, writing mash notes to the creators and asking if they could buy a DVD of the collected episodes. Mainstream media picked up on the phenomenon. The Village Voice described it as \" 'Clerks' meets 'Star Wars,' \" and the BBC called it \"riotously funny\" and said it was \"reminiscent of the anarchic energy of 'South Park.' \" Burns realized something strange was going on. He and his crew had created a hit comedy show -- entirely inside a video game. Video games have not enjoyed good publicity lately. Hillary Clinton has been denouncing the violence in titles like Grand Theft Auto, which was yanked out of many stores last month amid news that players had unlocked sex scenes hidden inside. Yet when they're not bemoaning the virtual bloodshed, cultural pundits grudgingly admit that today's games have become impressively cinematic. It's not merely that the graphics are so good: the camera angles inside the games borrow literally from the visual language of film. When you're playing Halo and look up at the sun, you'll see a little \"lens flare,\" as if you were viewing the whole experience through the eyepiece of a 16-millimeter Arriflex. By using the game to actually make cinema, Burns and his crew flipped a switch that neatly closed a self-referential media loop: movies begat games that begat movies. And Burns and his crew aren't alone. Video-game aficionados have been creating \"machinima\" -- an ungainly term mixing \"machine\" and \"cinema\" and pronounced ma-SHEEN-i-ma -- since the late 90's. \"Red vs. Blue\" is the first to break out of the underground, and now corporations like Volvo are hiring machinima artists to make short promotional films, while MTV, Spike TV and the Independent Film Channel are running comedy shorts and music videos produced inside games. By last spring, Burns and his friends were making so much money from \"Red vs. Blue\" that they left their jobs and founded Rooster Teeth Productions. Now they produce machinima full time. It may be the most unlikely form of indie filmmaking yet -- and one of the most weirdly democratic. \"It's like 'The Blair Witch Project' all over again, except you don't even need a camera,\" says Julie Kanarowski, a product manager with Electronic Arts, the nation's largest video-game publisher. \"You don't even need actors.\" Back in college, Burns and another Rooster Teeth founder, Matt Hullum, wrote and produced a traditional live-action indie movie. It cost $9,000, required a full year to make and was seen by virtually no one. By contrast, the four Xboxes needed to make \"Red vs. Blue\" cost a mere $600. Each 10-minute episode requires a single day to perform and edit and is viewed by hordes of feverish video-game fans the planet over. More than just a cheap way to make an animated movie, machinima allows game players to comment directly on the pop culture they so devotedly consume. Much like \"fan fiction\" (homespun tales featuring popular TV characters) or \"mash-ups\" (music fans blending two songs to create a new hybrid), machinima is a fan-created art form. It's what you get when gamers stop blasting aliens for a second and start messing with the narrative. And God knows, there's plenty to mess with. These days, the worlds inside games are so huge and open-ended that gamers can roam anywhere they wish. Indeed, players often abandon the official goal of the game -- save the princess; vanquish the eldritch forces of evil -- in favor of merely using the virtual environment as a gigantic jungle gym. In one popular piece of Halo machinima, \"Warthog Jump,\" a player cunningly used the game to conduct a series of dazzling physics experiments. He placed grenades in precise locations beneath jeeps and troops, such that when the targets blew sky-high, they pinwheeled through the air in precise formations, like synchronized divers. Another gamer recorded a machinima movie that poked subversive fun at Grand Theft Auto. Instead of playing as a dangerous, cop-killing gangster, the player pretended he was a naïve Canadian tourist -- putting down his gun, dressing in tacky clothes and simply wandering around the game's downtown environment for hours, admiring the scenery. So what's it like to actually shoot a movie inside a game? In June, I visited the Rooster Teeth offices in Buda, Tex., a tiny Austin suburb, to observe Burns and his group as they produced a scene of \"Red vs. Blue.\" Burns, a tall, burly 32-year-old, sat in front of two huge flat-panel screens, preparing the editing software. Nearby were the two Rooster Teeth producers who would be acting on-screen: Geoff Ramsey, a scraggly-bearded 30-year-old whose arms are completely covered in tattoos of fish and skulls, and Gustavo Sorola, a gangly 27-year-old who sprawled in a beanbag chair and peered through his thick architect glasses at the day's e-mail. They were fan letters, Sorola told me, that pour in from teenagers who are as enthusiastic as they are incoherent. \"The way kids write these days,\" he said with a grimace. \"It's like someone threw up on the keyboard.\" In the script they were acting out that day, a pair of \"Red vs. Blue\" soldiers engaged in one of their typically pointless existential arguments, bickering over whether it's possible to kill someone with a toy replica of a real weapon. The Rooster Teeth crew recorded the voice-overs earlier in the day; now they were going to create the animation for the scene. Burns picked up a controller and booted up Halo on an Xbox. He would act as the camera: whatever his character saw would be recorded, from his point of view. Then Sorola and Ramsey logged into the game, teleporting in as an orange-suited and a red-suited soldier. Burns posed them near a massive concrete bunker and frowned as he scrutinized the view on the computer screen. \"Hmmmm,\" he muttered. \"We need something to frame you guys -- some sort of prop.\" He ran his character over to a nearby alien hovercraft, jumped in and parked it next to the actors. \"Sweet!\" he said. \"I like it!\" In a \"Red vs. Blue\" shoot, the actors all must follow one important rule: Be careful not to accidentally kill another actor. \"Sometimes you'll drop your controller and it unintentionally launches a grenade. It takes, like, 20 minutes for the blood splatters to dry up,\" Ramsey said. \"Totally ruins the scene.\" Finally, Burns was ready to go. He shouted, \"Action!\" and the voice-overs began playing over loudspeakers. Sorola and Ramsey acted in time with the dialogue. Acting, in this context, was weirdly minimalist. They mashed the controller joysticks with their thumbs, bobbing the soldiers' heads back and forth roughly in time with important words in each line. \"It's puppetry, basically,\" Ramsey said, as he jiggled his controller. Of all the \"Red vs. Blue\" crew members, Ramsey is renowned for his dexterity with an Xbox. When a scene calls for more than five actors onstage, he'll put another controller on the ground and manipulate it with his right foot, allowing him to perform as two characters simultaneously. As I watched, I was reminded of what initially cracked me up so much about \"Red vs. Blue\": the idea that faceless, anonymous soldiers in a video game have interior lives. It's a \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern\" conceit; \"Red vs. Blue\" is what the game characters talk about when we're not around to play with them. As it turns out, they're a bunch of neurotics straight out of \"Seinfeld.\" One recruit reveals that he chain-smokes inside his airtight armor; a sergeant tells a soldier his battle instructions are to \"scream like a woman.\" And, in a sardonic gloss on the game's endless carnage, none of the soldiers have the vaguest clue why they're fighting. Yet as I discovered, real-life soldiers are among the most ardent fans of \"Red vs. Blue.\" When I walked around the Rooster Teeth office, I found it was festooned with letters, plaques and an enormous American flag, gifts from grateful American troops, many of whom are currently stationed in Iraq. Isn't it a little astonishing, I asked Burns when the crew went out in the baking Texas sun for a break, that actual soldiers are so enamored of a show that portrays troops as inept cowards, leaders as cynical sociopaths and war itself as a supremely meaningless endeavor? Burns laughed, but said the appeal was nothing sinister. \" 'Red vs. Blue' is about downtime,\" he said. \"There's very little action, which is precisely the way things are in real life.\" \"He's right,\" Ramsey added. He himself spent five years in the army after high school. \"We'd just sit around digging ditches and threatening to kill each other all day long,\" he said. \"We were bored out of our minds.\" Perhaps the most unusual thing about machinima is that none of its creators are in jail. After all, they're gleefully plundering intellectual property at a time when the copyright wars have become particularly vicious. Yet video-game companies have been upbeat -- even exuberant -- about the legions of teenagers and artists pillaging their games. This is particularly bewildering in the case of \"Red vs. Blue,\" because Halo is made by Bungie, a subsidiary of Microsoft, a company no stranger to using a courtroom to defend its goods. What the heck is going on? As it turns out, people at Bungie love \"Red vs. Blue.\" \"We thought it was kind of brilliant,\" says Brian Jarrard, the Bungie staff member who manages interactions with fans. \"There are people out there who would never have heard about Halo without 'Red vs. Blue.' It's getting an audience outside the hardcore gaming crowd.\" Sure, Rooster Teeth ripped off Microsoft's intellectual property. But Microsoft got something in return: \"Red vs. Blue\" gave the game a whiff of countercultural coolness, the sort of grass-roots street cred that major corporations desperately crave but can never manufacture. After talking with Rooster Teeth, Microsoft agreed, remarkably, to let them use the game without paying any licensing fees at all. In fact, the company later hired Rooster Teeth to produce \"Red vs. Blue\" videos to play as advertisements in game stores. Microsoft has been so strangely solicitous that when it was developing the sequel to Halo last year, the designers actually inserted a special command -- a joystick button that makes a soldier lower his weapon -- designed solely to make it easier for Rooster Teeth to do dialogue. \"If you're playing the game, there's no reason to lower your weapon at all,\" Burns explained. \"They put that in literally just so we can shoot machinima.\" Other game companies have gone even further. Many now include editing software with their games, specifically to encourage fans to shoot movies. When Valve software released its hit game Half-Life 2 last year, it included \"Faceposer\" software so that machinima creators could tweak the facial expressions of characters. When the Sims 2 -- a sequel to the top-selling game of all time -- came out last year, its publisher, Electronic Arts, set up a Web site so that fans could upload their Sims 2 movies to show to the world. (About 8,000 people so far have done so.) Still, it's one thing for gamers to produce a jokey comedy or a music video. Can machinima actually produce a work of art -- something with serious emotional depth? A few people have tried. In China, a visual artist named Feng Mengbo used the first-person-shooter game Quake III to produce Q4U, in which the screen is filled with multiple versions of himself, killing one another. Players' relationships with constant, blood-splattering violence is a common subject in game art. Last year, the 31-year-old artist Brody Condon produced an unsettling film that consisted of nothing but shots of himself committing suicide inside 50 different video games. \"I try to come to terms with what taking your life means in these games,\" Condon says. \"I'm trying to understand, spiritually, your relationship with an avatar on the screen.\" But even machinima's biggest fans admit that the vast majority of machinima is pretty amateurish. \"It's like if some friends of mine all broke into a movie set, and we all got to use all the cameras and special-effects equipment,\" says Carl Goodman, director of digital media at the American Museum of the Moving Image, which began to hold an annual machinima festival two years ago. \"We wouldn't quite know how to use it, but we'd make some pretty interesting stuff.\" Yet as Goodman points out, there's a competing proposition. Machinima does not always strive to emulate \"realistic,\" artistic movies. On the contrary, it is often explicitly devoted to celebrating the aesthetics of games -- the animations and in-jokes, the precise physics. Most machinima is probably meaningless to people who don't play games, much as ESPN is opaque to anyone who doesn't watch sports. But for those who do play Halo, it was genuinely thrilling to see something like \"Warthog Jump,\" with its meticulously synchronized explosions. The Rooster Teeth crew has its own hilariously stringent rule for making machinima: no cheating. When they shoot \"Red vs. Blue,\" they do not use any special effects that are not organically included in the game; everything you see in an episode of \"Red vs. Blue\" could in theory have taken place during an actual game of Halo, played by a fan in his bedroom. It's a charmingly purist attitude, a sci-fi version of the \"Dogma\" school of indie film, which argues that movies are best when cinematic trickery is kept to a minimum. One evening in New York, I visited with Ethan Vogt as he and his machinima team shot a car-chase scene for a Volvo promo. Vogt and two producers sat at computers, logged into a multiplayer game; each producer controlled a car racing through crowded city streets, while Vogt controlled a free-floating \"camera\" that followed behind, recording the visuals. The vehicles -- an enormous 1972 Chevy Impala and a Volvo V50 -- screamed along at about 60 miles an hour, fishtailing through corners while plowing into mailboxes, lampposts and, occasionally, clots of pedestrians. The lead car burst into flames. \"That's great,\" Vogt said. \"That's great.\" Though it shares with independent filmmaking a do-it-yourself aesthetic, machinima inverts the central tradition of indie film: smallness. With their skimpy budgets, indie directors tend to set movies in kitchens or living rooms -- and focus instead on providing quality acting and scripts. Machinima, in contrast, often has horribly cheesy acting and ham-fisted, purple-prose stories -- but they're set in outer space. Want massive shootouts? Howling mob scenes? Roman gladiatorial armies clashing by night? No problem. It is the rare form of amateur film in which the directors aspire to be not Wes Anderson but George Lucas. Indeed, with video games played on computers, it is now possible to build an entire world from scratch. The core of any video game is its game engine, the software that knows how to render 3-D objects and how to realistically represent the physics of how they move, bounce or collide. But the actual objects inside the game -- the people, the cars, the guns, even the buildings -- can be altered, tweaked or replaced by modifications, or \"mods.\" Mods do not require any deep programming skills; indeed, almost any teenager with a passing acquaintance in graphic-design software can \"re-skin\" a character in a game to make it look like himself, for instance. (Xbox and PlayStation games, in comparison, are much harder to mod, because the consoles are locked boxes, designed to prevent players from tampering with the games.) I was able to see modding in action one night when I visited the ILL Clan, a pioneering machinima group. Their headquarters are the kitchen table in the cramped one-bedroom Brooklyn apartment of Frank Dellario; a lanky, hyperkinetic 42-year-old, he sat on a rickety folding chair, pecking at a keyboard. The table was littered with four computer screens and laptops, the remnants of take-out sushi and a hopelessly tangled morass of computer cords and joysticks; a huge wide-screen TV lurked behind them for viewing their work. On the night I visited, they were using a game engine called Torque to shoot a short heist movie for Audi, in which two thugs beat up a concert violinist and make off with an antique violin in a van. To quickly create a gritty-looking city, Dellario and his colleague -- ILL Clan's co-founder, Matt Dominianni -- hired a local artist to build a generic-looking urban intersection inside the game. To customize it, Dominianni went onto Google, found snapshots of a few seedy stores (an adult bookstore, a tattoo parlor and a furniture outlet) and digitally pasted them onto the front of the buildings. Then they went to a site called Turbo-Squid, a sort of Amazon for virtual in-game items, and for $45 bought a van that could be plunked down inside the game. When I arrived, they were browsing the site and contemplating buying a few women. \"My God, look at this one,\" Dellario marveled, as he clicked open a picture of an eerily realistic 3-D brunette named Masha. \"I'm going to marry this woman. They've finally broken through to total reality.\" Dellario put the van into the correct location in the scene, then logged into the game to figure out the camera angle for this shot. He frowned. It didn't look right. The lighting was all off, with shadows falling in the wrong places. Dominianni figured out the problem: \"The sun is supposed to be at high noon. It's in the wrong place.\" \"Oh, yeah,\" Dellario said. \"Let me move it.\" He pulled up a menu, clicked on the \"sun\" command, and dragged it across the sky. Now they were finally ready to shoot. Dellario realized they needed an extra pair of hands to manipulate one of the thugs. \"Want to act in this scene?\" Dellario asked, and he handed me a joystick. I sat down at one of the computers and took control of \"Thug1,\" a brown-haired man in a golf shirt and brown pants, carrying the stolen violin. Dominianni was playing \"Thug2.\" Our characters were supposed to look around to make sure the coast is clear, then jump in the truck and race off. Dellario gave me my motivation: \"It's like you hear a suspicious noise. You're nervous.\" I used the joystick to practice moving my virtual character, craning its neck -- my neck? -- back and forth. I have played plenty of video games, but this felt awfully odd. Usually when I am inside a game, I'm just worried about staying alive while the bullets whiz past my ears. I've never had to emote. While Dellario and Dominianni fiddled with the camera angle, I grew impatient and wandered around, exploring the virtual set. I peered in a few shop windows -- they were strikingly photorealistic, even up close. Then I walked down an alley and suddenly arrived at the end of the set. It was like a tiny Western town in the desert: once you got beyond the few clustered buildings, there was nothing there -- just a vast, enormous plain, utterly empty and stretching off infinitely into the distance. This spring, electronic arts decided to promote the Sims 2 by hiring Rooster Teeth to create a machinima show using the game. Called \"The Strangerhood,\" it would be freely available online. \"The Strangerhood\" is a parody of reality TV: a group of people wake up one day to discover that they are living in new houses, and they can't remember who they are or how they got there. In the Sims 2, the animated people are impressively Pixar-like and expressive, making \"The Strangerhood\" even more like a mainstream animated show than \"Red vs. Blue\"; you could almost imagine watching it on Saturday morning. The problem is, the Sims 2 has turned out to be incredibly difficult to shoot with. When the Rooster Teeth gang uses Halo for machinima, the characters are mere puppets and can be posed any way the creators want. But in the Sims 2, the little virtual characters have artificial intelligence and free will. When you're playing, you do not control all the action: the fun is in putting your Sims in interesting social situations, then standing back and watching what they'll do. When Rooster Teeth's Matt Hullum builds a virtual set and puts the \"Strangerhood\" characters in place for a shoot, he's never quite sure what will happen. To shoot a scene in which two men wake up in bed together, Hullum had to spend hours playing with the two characters -- who are nominally heterosexual -- forcing them into repeated conversations until they eventually became such good friends they were willing to share a bed. Shooting machinima with Sims is thus maddeningly like using actual, human stars: they're stubborn; they stage hissy fits and stomp off to their trailers. \"We'll do three or four takes of a scene, and one of the Sims will start getting tired and want to go to sleep,\" Hullum said. \"It's just like being on a real set. You're screaming: 'Quick, quick, get the shot! We're losing light!' \" Hullum showed me a typical \"Strangerhood\" scene. He put Nikki, a young ponytailed brunette in a baseball cap, in the kitchen to interact with Wade, a slacker who looked eerily like a digital Owen Wilson. (To give Wade a mellow, San Francisco vibe, Hullum programmed him to move at a pace 50 percent slower than the other characters.) Hullum pointed to Nikki's \"mood\" bar; it was low, which meant she was in a bad mood and wouldn't want to talk. \"When they're bored, you have to lock them in a room alone for a few hours until they start to crave conversation,\" Hullum said. He tried anyway, prodding Wade to approach her and talk about food, one of Nikki's favorite subjects. It worked. The two became engrossed in a conversation, laughing and gesticulating wildly. \"See, this footage would be great if we were shooting a scene where these guys are maybe gossiping,\" Hullum mused, as he zoomed the camera in to frame a close-up on Wade. Then Nikki started to yawn. \"Oh, damn. See -- she's getting bored. Oh, no, she's walking away,\" Hullum said, as the little virtual Nikki wandered out of the room. \"Damn. You see what we have to deal with?\" The audience for \"The Strangerhood\" has not exploded the way \"Red vs. Blue\" did. The project is a gamble: its creators hope it will break out of machinima's geeky subculture and vault into the mainstream. Though in a way, Hullum said, the mainstream isn't always a fun place to be, either. Before he returned to Austin to work on \"Red vs. Blue,\" he spent six miserable years in Hollywood working on second-rate teen movies with big budgets, like \"Scooby-Doo\" and \"The Faculty.\" \"So now to come to this, where we have total creative control of our own stuff, it's amazing,\" Hullum said, as he watched Nikki walk out of the house in search of a more interesting conversation. \"I just pray we can keep this going. Because if we can't, I'm in big trouble.\" Clive Thompson is a contributing writer for the magazine."

                "SYNTHETIC WORLDS The Business and Culture of Online Games. By Edward Castronova. 332 pp. University of Chicago Press. $29. SMARTBOMB The Quest for Art, Entertainment and Big Bucks in the Videogame Revolution. By Heather Chaplin and Aaron Ruby. 287 pp. Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill. $24.95. Here's a theory that may be neither original nor empirically defensible but feels true: The more fun an activity is, the less interesting it is to read about. War producces great journalism; water-skiing does not. Can you guess where video games fall on this spectrum? In the last few years, a great many words have been expended to report on this flourishing cultural phenomenon. Most accounts begin with a hyperactive presentation of statistics, which we will not rehearse here. This is all you need to know (and perhaps already do): Video games have grown into a huge business, outpacing the movie industry and bulldozing childhood as we knew it. We adults are not safe, either. Whether they admit it or not, you probably have friends who can be found awake at 2 a.m. disemboweling orcs, foiling terrorist plots and scooping up fumbles and running them into end zones. It is the opinion of Edward Castronova, author of \"Synthetic Worlds,\" that such electronic experiences are not merely a hedge against boredom but a profound indicator of where the entire world is heading. Online, off-line; reality, fantasy -- these distinctions will cease to matter as more and more of us pass our time in virtual environments. Economies will evolve as we pay real money for virtual goods and vice versa. Conflicts that begin online will spill into the real world and back. Laws will be written to protect our newfound interests. Castronova's vision has elements of both utopia and dystopia. But mostly he is bullish. Life in these alternative zones may eventually become so fulfilling, he contends, \"that a fairly substantial exodus may loom in the distance.\" He means this, really. Like the Irish and Italians who left their native lands in the late 19th century to come to America, gamers could create a genuine human migration, away from the real and into the virtual. What will be real then? The specific object of Castronova's scholarship is Mmorpgs, the inelegant acronym for \"massively multiplayer online role-playing games,\" which can involve hundreds of thousands of players plugging in from all over the world. A disproportionate number of these games revolve around dwarfs, wizards, quests and magic lands, though the content is becoming ever more diverse. These days, there's a Mmorpg out there to suit the interests of just about anybody. One game, The Sims Online, merely simulates suburban life, and it is madly popular. Castronova is an economist who teaches telecommunications at Indiana University, and among academic economists he is a bold contrarian, if only because he dares to take computer games seriously. My oh my does he take them seriously. In dense, lifeless prose, he sledgehammers away at his major themes, constantly pausing to review the material he's just covered and preview what is to come. His sweeping conclusions are intriguing -- get ready for governments sending agents into virtual worlds and waging war with avatars! -- but he's not a vivid enough writer to animate most of his futuristic abstractions. In \"Smartbomb,\" Heather Chaplin and Aaron Ruby try harder to entertain. They've organized their history of video games as a study of ambitious individuals, breaking it down into a series of breezy, magazinelike profiles of uneven quality. A lot of the original reporting seems to take place at gaming conventions, which is not where one imagines the really interesting stuff happens. But the stories are pretty good, even when they don't break new ground. Rereading the legend of Nolan Bushnell and the founding of Atari is like hearing a bar band play a spirited \"Twist and Shout\" -- enjoyable, but no additional points for Degree of Difficulty. In two spots, though, Chaplin and Ruby really score. In their chapter on Mmorpgs, they sensitively profile David Reber, a 30-year-old Californian who spends every free moment chained to his computer, acting out a series of intense fantasy existences that provide him with the companionship and sense of achievement missing in his real life. Just as Castronova would predict, Reber withdraws from the real world as his fantasy life deepens -- he has lapses at work and when Chaplin and Ruby last check in with him, he's moved back in with his mother. The other winning portrait in \"Smartbomb\" is of Will Wright, the creator of SimCity, as well as its offshoot The Sims, and a new simulation called Spore in which players guide a new creature from its biological origin onward. In an industry that mimics Hollywood's craven predilection for cheap, gory theatrics, Wright stands apart as a humble philosopher in love with the potential of games to expand the human experience. Though Chaplin and Ruby don't have much to say themselves about the significance of video games, they wisely hand matters over to Wright, who foresees a future that might just keep us all staying up past 2 a.m. \"I think one thing that's unique about video games is not only that they can respond to you but down the road they'll be able to adapt themselves to you. They'll learn your desires,\" he says. \"It might just be that games become deeply personal artifacts -- more like dreams.\" Video Game Books Hugo Lindgren is the editorial director of New York Magazine."

                "THE great thing about shopping for video games is that the person you're buying the gift for almost certainly knows more about it than you do. If you have gamers in your life, no matter what age, odds are that they already know exactly what they want. You need only shut up and fork over the credit card. You can use this to your advantage. If you are lucky enough that the gamer on your list has said anything recently about a game or game machine that is not Microsoft's new Xbox 360, the smart move is to drop whatever you're doing right now and buy it. That way, you will not be among the hordes this holiday season already wondering if they can afford to miss a car payment, or maybe a mortgage installment, to satisfy their 360-craving gamer. That is because the 360, with its snazzy graphics and slick online interface, has emerged as the It gift of the 2005 holiday season. Theoretically, the 360 is supposed to cost $300 for a basic unit and $400 for the deluxe version. In reality, the console is sold out across the country and is now fetching $1,000 or so on eBay. And that's before you buy any games, which run up to $60 each. So if your favorite gamer is interested in anything else this year, consider yourself fortunate. Thankfully, forgoing the 360 doesn't mean returning to the Stone Age of, say, Pong. There are still excellent games being made for the current generation of home game consoles -- Sony's PlayStation 2, Nintendo's GameCube, and the original Xbox, which each cost less than $200 -- and Sony's $250 PSP headlines the strong current crop of hand-held units. Moreover, if you have a powerful PC, that may still be your most capable game machine. In any case, both Sony and Nintendo have new game consoles on the way next year. And availability of the 360 is sure to improve in early 2006. There is a chance that Microsoft could show up with a \"surprise\" boatload of additional 360's in the next few weeks. (The word from the company is that it is working as hard as it can to get units to retailers.) Unless you're willing to pay the prices on eBay or other auction sites, the best advice to shoppers who absolutely must have a 360 is to get themselves on waiting lists at as many retailers and Web sites as possible. So those folks you saw camped out on sidewalks before the 360 went on sale on Nov. 22 don't look so silly now, right? Waiting in line for a midnight sale at a Wal-Mart in Moline, Ill., Kara Harvell told The Quad-City Times that she wanted to buy the console for her five sons. Deliciously, the newspaper reported that Ms. Harvell, a nursing school student, \"got out of class by telling her professor that her son wasn't feeling well at school.\" Of course, some people don't like waiting in line. In the (very) few days before the machine sold out, scattered reports emerged of shoppers being held up for their 360's as they left stores. Please don't go robbing anyone. But if you've already gone through the effort of finding a 360 at its regular price, it is certainly worth the extra $100 for the higher-end model. The full version comes with a headset (for making free phone calls over the Internet to other Xbox users), a wireless controller (instead of a wired model) and a hard drive, which you need to play games made for the original Xbox. Top-line games are $50 to $60. The unit comes with a free basic membership to Microsoft's online game service, which lets you talk to other online 360 users and compare scores. But if you want to actually play head-to-head live over the Internet, you need to buy the \"gold\" membership, which costs $8 a month or $50 a year. In addition to playing games with eye-popping graphics, the machine plays DVD's and can display photos from your digital camera on your regular or high-definition television. Luckily, the 360 is not the only game system potentially worth buying this holiday season. There are cheaper and more readily available options, too. Besides the Xbox 360, the other major new game machine is Sony's PSP hand-held. The sleek black unit has a clear, colorful screen that is far more vibrant than one would expect from a hand-held device, and that may be why people on buses and trains seem to be using their PSP's to watch movies as much as playing games. Dozens of movies are now being released on the small UMD data discs that slip into the back of the PSP, which inexplicably comes with white headphones reminiscent of those supplied with Apple's iPods. Over all, the games for the PSP have been lackluster so far, but that trend shows signs of changing. Aimed at adults, the new Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories takes advantage of the PSP's built-in wireless capability to allow multiple PSP users to battle one another through the game's streets and alleys, even as the players themselves are on the go. Next year, a new installment of the quirky family-friendly Japanese game Katamari Damacy is expected for the PSP. Even cheaper and smaller than the PSP is Nintendo's DS hand-held, which costs about $130. Nintendo has long been popular with young gamers, but the new Nintendogs pet simulator is finding fans among both children and adult women. The screens on the DS, which stands for dual screen, are not quite as impressive as the PSP's, but are still clear enough for enjoyable gaming. But rather than play on the go, many people still prefer their video games on the television in the den. With all of the hype around the 360 it is easy to overlook that you can now buy the original Xbox or Sony's PlayStation 2 each for around $150. Bundles that include a console and a few games can be found under $300 on the Web. Nintendo's GameCube console now costs only around $100. Of course, the Xbox, GameCube and PS2 certainly don't have the cachet of the new 360. And most serious gamers already have one, two or even all three of the older systems. But if you are looking for a cost-effective way to introduce a young person to gaming, buying any of the older systems is a smart move. In fact, many serious gamers would argue that the games being made now for those mature machines are actually better than those for the 360, which is still so new that developers have not yet figured out how to fully harness its power. The older games just don't look quite as snazzy. But until Sony's PlayStation 3 and Nintendo's Revolution are released next year, the Xbox 360 is clearly the best gaming machine around (unless you want to consider a top-notch gaming PC, which could easily cost more than $2,000). If someone you know wants a 360 and you can't find it at a reasonable price, perhaps fend them off with a PSP or a gift certificate that can be exchanged for some new games for an existing console. Then promise you'll get a 360, PlayStation 3 or Revolution next year. You may forget the promise, but they won't. Is It Live, or Is It A Video Game? THERE are about 20 games available for Microsoft's new Xbox 360. It does not have a single hit title yet, as Halo became for the original Xbox, and the lineup is still missing some genres, like role-playing games. Nonetheless, games out now do a good job of demonstrating how the next generation of consoles deliver visual and social experiences far more sophisticated than those possible on older consoles. The strongest two genres on the 360 are auto racing and first-person shooters. On the racetrack, Project Gotham Racing 3 lets you speed through detailed recreated cities like New York, Las Vegas and London. You can race in online leagues, compete against \"ghosts\" that simulate your friends' best performances or \"tune in\" and watch from the sidelines as some of the best virtual drivers in the world go wheel to wheel. The shooters put a player in the perspective of a person fighting, often with guns. Among the standouts are Perfect Dark Zero, set in the near future, and Call of Duty 2, a gritty re-creation of World War II. The most visually impressive 360 game is Kameo: Elements of Power, an action adventure that looks like child's play, with its evocation of a Pixar animated film, but is challenging at points. About half the games for the 360 mimic real-life sports. NBA 2K6, which at times could pass for a live telecast, is the most impressive of the bunch. Amped 3, a snowboarding simulator, is easy to play and gorgeous to watch. SETH SCHIESEL"

                "Tomorrow the Xbox, the new video-game console from Microsoft, arrives in stores on the heels of a $500 million marketing blitz. But it doesn't seem as if much of that money is going to the thousands of musicians who have provided the company with songs to use in the games that will be played on it. Though a band can typically make $10,000 to $20,000 when a song is included in a video game, Microsoft has been asking musicians to contribute their music to video games for pennies -- and in some cases no money at all, with no upfront fee and no royalties on the back end. Musicians, from small, independent punk bands to major-label artists, have been accepting this deal, hoping for the promotional boost that comes with being heard in a game that is played obsessively by teenagers across the country. Joining a band is not a lucrative career choice for most musicians. Many who are signed to major labels spend their careers in debt to those record companies, trying to earn back advances and expenses. But the increasing use of contemporary songs in movies, video games and advertisements has meant an unexpected windfall for lesser-known and midlevel artists. Microsoft, however, is changing that dynamic. ''I asked if we could get any money, and they just said no,'' said Larry Cooper, who runs Revelation Records, a punk, metal and hardcore label that has several songs on the soundtrack to Amped, a snowboarding game. ''I almost thought that out of principle, if there's no payment, we shouldn't do that kind of stuff. But I didn't want to snip out an opportunity for a band that might want to do that kind of promotion.'' Of the bands Mr. Cooper asked, all but one agreed to provide free music to Microsoft. ''I think they were just looking for cheap music, and that's why they called a lot of small labels,'' Mr. Cooper continued. ''I asked them who else was on the soundtrack and made some suggestions, but they said they wanted to stick with certain labels because they didn't have to pay for licensing.'' Brenner Adams, a product planner on Amped, said that on his game Microsoft was looking not for cheap music but for an opportunity to expose as many small underground bands as possible. Under Microsoft policy the interview with Mr. Adams was conducted with a company publicist on the line, taking notes on the conversation. ''We're not saying, 'Hey, we want to use your music for nothing,' '' Mr. Adams said. ''We said, 'Hey, we really want to promote these artists and promote who they are and what they stand for.' '' Though Microsoft didn't give any money to musicians on such independent labels, it did offer small amounts to bands on major labels. It made a deal with Virgin Records, obtaining songs from acts like the Gorillaz, Iggy Pop, the Chemical Brothers and Timbaland & Magoo by paying ''small fees and publishing,'' said Brad Fox, the director of artist development at Virgin. The amount of course remains a big contrast to the millions of dollars that Microsoft is believed to have paid to use Madonna's ''Ray of Light'' in its 60-second Windows XP advertisement. ''We're looking at this as a marketing exercise,'' Mr. Fox said. ''There's no way I could get 10 to 15 different artists in somebody's house in front of an active consumer audience for 20 hours a week. If I could get 20 percent of those kids to go buy a record, that's great.'' But the Xbox isn't like other systems, nor are these deals like other deals. Many record labels are operating on the faith that Microsoft will make efforts to promote their bands. Mr. Fox said he hoped that the Virgin artists used in the games would be mentioned in Xbox promotional material, game catalogs and game boxes. But a trip to the Xbox Web site showed that the artists on games like Amped were not mentioned on the box or promotional poster shown online, nor were the bands on any game highlighted in any special way on the Web site. Other promotional efforts, however, have been made: there was a link at the site to a radio station playing music from Amped, and at a recent Xbox promotional party in Los Angeles Microsoft gave away a CD with music from Amped. Mr. Adams noted that most of the cash deals were made with better-known bands that don't need the publicity as much. ''So,'' he said, ''why not turn the decision around, bring the smaller guys up and give them the promotion they can't get anywhere else?'' He said that music from some 240 artists was used on Amped, that in the game the names of the record labels are shown on banners and that players had the option of seeing names of the bands, songs and record labels. He added that the company hoped to stage more promotions with the music. But there is no guarantee that gamers will hear much if any of the music of these bands. That is because in a feature unique to the Xbox consumers have the option of wiping out the soundtrack to a game and replacing it with music from their own CD's. Originally music executives were less worried about artists not getting paid than about the potential for Xbox to become a new Napster, since it has a large hard drive and online capabilities. But in a statement prepared for this article Microsoft said that though music could be stored on the hard drive, it could not be copied on ''CD's, MP3's or any other devices.'' Other executives in the music publishing business now worry that video game manufacturers and even advertising agencies will follow Microsoft's lead and tell bands that in exchange for use of their music at no cost, an extra effort will be made to promote the groups in products and commercials. As it is, artists sacrifice a lot of money and time at the altar of promotion, taking on costly and inconvenient tasks gratis, like performing concerts promoted by radio stations. So, some wonder, in a field in which just about anything musicians do can be seen as raising their profiles, where is the line between promotional and paid work? Jeff Koz, the chief executive of SubZero, a company that brokers deals between advertisers and musicians, said, ''We believe that people should be paid for what they do.'' Mr. Koz has worked with Microsoft on music and sound design. He added, however, that there was a give-and-take between payment and promotion, and lesser-known artists were often given somewhat lower fees in exchange for what could be career-enhancing exposure. ''There's value to cross-promotion,'' he said, ''and we're not privy to how those Microsoft deals went down. Some of those bands might see it as a tremendous opportunity.'' No. 1 and Dropping The new Britney Spears album, ''Britney,'' will enter the pop charts next week at No. 1 with 769,000 copies sold, according to Soundscan, a company that tracks retail sales. The number, a significant drop from the first-week sales of her previous album (1.3 million), reflects a teenage pop demand that is slipping but still hanging on tenaciously as Ms. Spears sagely remakes her image so she has one foot in the teenage world and the other in the general pop market (an approach best summed up by her song title ''I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman''). The following week, record executives say, ''Britney'' seems likely to slip to No. 2 when the Garth Brooks album ''Scarecrow'' makes its debut with predicted sales of more than one million copies."

                "LOS ANGELES — Microsoft, seeking to expand offerings on its Xbox 360 console, has reached an agreement with a company headed by Peter Safran, the veteran Hollywood producer and talent manager, to produce original shows for distribution on the system. Through his Safran Co., he represents clients like the actor and producer Sean Combs (\"Monster's Ball\"), the actor and writer Nia Vardalos (\"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\") and the filmmakers Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer (\"Epic Movie\"). Safran founded the company in 2006 after leaving Brillstein-Grey Management. Speaking by telephone last week, Scott Nocas, global marketing manager for programming of the Xbox Live entertainment service, said he expected similar deals to follow. \"We definitely look at this as the first of many,\" said Nocas. In an interview at his office in Los Angeles last week, Safran said his first round of programs would be scripted and would probably run under 10 minutes. He said his initial focus would be on genres like comedy and horror that appeal to the Xbox 360 audience, which is heavily concentrated from the ages of 14 to 34, and tends to be more male than female. The first shows are expected to be available to viewers by autumn in the Northern Hemisphere. \"The Xbox is unique; it operates at a level outside of what we generally consider Web entertainment,\" Safran said, referring to the system's tight demographic base, which is defined by the appeal of signature games like the Halo series. The new shows will be available exclusively via the Xbox 360 for a time, then may appear elsewhere, Safran said."

                "Looking for an advantage in the next round of the video-console wars, Microsoft has made the first move. Three and a half years after it entered the console market with the Xbox, Microsoft yesterday unveiled its successor, the Xbox 360, a creamy white console that is to go on sale in North America, Europe and Japan by the holiday season. Though noticeably smaller than its squat black predecessor, the console houses three 3.2-gigahertz I.B.M. microprocessors that could qualify it as the most powerful home computer on the market. Indeed, unlike the original Xbox, the new console can act as a home entertainment hub, streaming pictures, music and video from digital cameras, portable music players and computers that run Microsoft Windows XP. Most evidently different, Xbox 360, which Microsoft introduced last night in a 30-minute presentation on MTV, is designed to display games in wide-screen, high-definition format as well as in standard definition. Microsoft's move, after years of secrecy, rumors and fragmentary disclosures, comes as its competitors -- Sony, the undisputed industry leader, and Nintendo, a close third worldwide -- are also preparing presentations of their coming consoles for the Electronic Entertainment Expo, a major industry trade show, in Los Angeles next week. Representatives of those companies said their game systems, Sony's PlayStation 3 and Nintendo's, which is code-named Revolution, are set for release next year. For the game industry, with $10 billion a year in sales in the United States alone, the consoles' arrivals will not only give rise to new demand for game hardware but will set off a new wave of game development and purchases. As the consoles put new emphasis on high-definition video, they may stimulate TV sales as well. One analyst, describing the anticipation surrounding the announcements, said it was as if Detroit released a new line of automobiles only once every four or five years. \"The business is getting bigger, the stakes are getting higher, and there is such a big leap in technology, potentially making the games ever more realistic and involving,\" said Anita Frazier, entertainment industry analyst for NPD Funworld. Microsoft did not disclose the pricing of its new console. Since their introductions, the current Xbox and Sony's PlayStation 2 have dropped in price from $300 to $150 in the United States; Nintendo's GameCube, originally $200, is now $100. When Xbox arrived in 2001, it was heralded as the most powerful of the consoles and had innovations including a built-in hard drive and an Ethernet port for online play. The machine's biggest hits have been the Halo games, published by Microsoft itself; Halo 2, released last fall, has sold 6.3 million copies. Xbox has also developed a following among game developers, who have been drawn to its power. Still, even with 20 million consoles sold, Xbox has been far outdistanced by Sony's PlayStation 2, with sales of 80 million and 70 percent of the world market. While Halo 2's success put Microsoft's games unit in the black for one quarter last year, the Xbox effort has yet to provide sustained profitability. \"Xbox 1 was very much ready, fire, aim,\" said J Allard, corporate vice president at Microsoft and a leading architect of the Xbox effort. \"We had 19 months and a day between the day we approved the project to the day we were on store shelves.\" For the new Xbox project, Mr. Allard said his team had twice that time and aimed at conceiving a \"magical product\" that was so well integrated it would seem the creation of a single mind. In sheer computing power, the new Xbox is capable of a trillion calculations per second, many orders of magnitude above the original Xbox. (The current box depends mainly on a 733-megahertz processor.) The heat generated by all that power will be drawn off by a water-based cooling system, something usually seen only in high-end PC's. It will also include a redesigned wireless game controller. A Web camera, code-named Cyclops, and a TV-like remote control will be optional. Peter Moore, a Microsoft corporate vice president for worldwide sales and marketing, said Xbox 360 would be especially suited for wide-screen high-definition television and Digital Dolby 5.1 multichannel sound, a requirement for all Xbox 360 games. He added that the new console would also be more seamlessly integrated with Xbox Live, the service that connects games and gamers over high-speed Internet connections for multiplayer action. Xbox Live, which has 1.4 million subscribers, will include a new tier that waives the $6 monthly fee. A demonstration of the console's power delivered stunningly realistic scenes that were indistinguishable at some points from live-action video. \"We have to continue to feed that core audience,\" Robert J. Bach, senior vice president and chief Xbox officer at Microsoft, said of the most ardent gamers. \"But part of the challenge of this next generation is how do we cultivate a broader mass audience.\" Part of that strategy, he said, includes designing Xbox 360 to perform a range of nongaming functions suited to the living room, like streaming digital music and pictures, or videoconferencing. In addition to playing DVD's, as the current Xbox does, it can rip songs from CD's onto a 20-gigabyte hard drive -- a hard drive that can be removed, upgraded and interchanged with other 360 consoles. Judging by dozens of Web sites dedicated to interest in next-generation consoles, expectations are soaring that Xbox 360's competitors will also provide vastly improved graphics, sound and game playing. For example, it is widely believed that Sony's PlayStation 3, which will use a new cell processor technology, will be the most powerful. Molly Smith, a Sony spokeswoman, would not discuss hardware specifics of the PlayStation 3. But she did say that it would be able to deliver \"a quantum leap\" in gaming and electronic entertainment. Nintendo, struggling to shed an image that its technologies mostly appeal to children, is preparing to deliver a game console that is radically different from the cute and cuddly GameCube. Perrin Kaplan, Nintendo's vice president for corporate affairs, said GameCube's successor would be \"very, very sleek.\" She described it as horizontal and no taller than a stack of three DVD cases. Unlike GameCube, the new system will play DVD's, Ms. Kaplin said, and will feature a wireless controller. It will play GameCube games as well as a new class of high-definition games, with new emphasis on online play. Microsoft would not say whether games for the current Xbox would play on Xbox 360. Some industry analysts and game developers said it was likely that games for all three consoles would increase to $60 or $65; the typical price for premium titles on the current machines is $50. \"Over all, the introduction of the next-generation systems will have a very positive impact on the video game industry,\" said Will Kassoy, vice president for global brand management at Activision, a game publisher. \"They will expand the user base and grow software sales.\" Historically, he said, each new cycle of consoles has ushered in a 30 percent rise in the number of players. \"We believe this next generation will see similar growth,\" Mr. Kassoy said. Activision is scheduled to have four games for Xbox 360 at the start, including some of the company's best-selling series -- Tony Hawk, Call to Duty and Quake. Simon Jeffery, president of Sega, said his company would have two titles for Xbox 360 for the holiday season -- Condemned: Criminal Origins and Full Auto -- emphasizing that they will take advantage of the new console's increased power. \"Every successive jump in technology affords new elements of games,\" he said. \"We now will have processing power to do things we haven't been able to do before.\""

                "Sending voice and Webcam picture messages to fellow Xbox 360 players over Microsoft’s Xbox Live service is a cinch, but tapping out old-fashioned text messages using the 360’s onscreen keyboard isn’t much fun. A new $30 miniature keyboard called the Chatpad speeds up text entry to let you best even the fastest BlackBerry touch-typists.  The Chatpad, to go on sale Sept. 6, attaches to the underside of the 360’s controller without interfering with the controller’s comfortable feel in the hands. A backlight makes typing during late-night Gears of War campaigns easier on the eyes, and a dedicated Messenger button activates the 360’s instant messaging program so you can taunt your enemies without breaking from the action. Unfortunately you can’t use the keyboard to type a letter and jump to the corresponding spot in long lists of Xbox Live movie downloads or songs stored on an iPod connected to the 360. Instead, you need to hold down the scroll button. Albert Penello, director for global marketing for Xbox, said the company was looking into a way to add this feature. "

                "FORGET horsepower, forget miles per gallon: the key metric for judging the Nissan Urge, a design study to be introduced today at the North American International Automobile Show in Detroit, is polygons per second, an index of performance for video games. Five hundred million polygons a second is the rating for the Microsoft Xbox 360 video game system tucked away in the car's trunk. It pumps out images fast enough to generate dizzyingly sharp scenes of city streets and speeding cars on a display that folds down from above the windshield. The Urge's key trick is that when parked, its steering wheel and pedals can be used to control the Xbox. The game's soundtrack of roaring engines and screeching tires play through the car's speakers to accompany the action on the screen. Many cars have had video game displays installed in their dashboards. The Urge is the first car to be turned into a game controller -- the tail is now wagging the dog. The Urge, created at Nissan Design America in the La Jolla section of San Diego, is another of the auto industry's seemingly endless quests for \"echo boomer\" customers, a coterie that for carmakers gleams over the horizon the way the mythical city of Eldorado did for the conquistadors. In part, the Urge is a response to an online survey, said John Cupit, a design manager for Nissan. Mr. Cupit interpreted the survey results in the bare, exposed look of the Urge, an articulation of the car's parts aimed, he said, at giving the feel of a motorcycle. The fenders and structure, mostly aluminum, stand out as separate parts. The engine -- a piece of the car so unimportant in this case that Nissan did not even provide the usual specifications of horsepower and torque -- is visible beneath a transparent hood. Nissan calls the look \"minimalism to the maximum.\" The bottoms of the doors are cut away, revealing a surrounding frame of aluminum rendered in \"acid yellow,\" which Anka Mazzei, the color designer, said she chose to express intensity and speed. The front end of the Urge is similar to the GT-R Proto, a concept that Nissan unveiled at the Tokyo auto show last fall. But one should not take the exterior of the Urge too literally. Its weirdness signals that it is unlikely to become a production vehicle. What counts is the concept. Urge is an implicit response to cultural change: young buyers have proved more fascinated by the innovations of their new cellphones, hand-held devices and video games than by the automotive advances that captivated their parents. The showcase game for the Xbox 360 is a special edition of Project Gotham Racing, one of the hit titles for the original Xbox as well. Mr. Cupit said that he and his colleagues at the La Jolla studio spend a lot of time playing on a huge plasma screen. The project was a joint effort with Microsoft, so the Xbox 360 beneath the boattail- shape trunk, one of a half-million consoles shipped since the game system went on sale Nov. 22, is different from the others: no one stood in line to buy it. Video gaming is not the only technology incorporated into the Urge. In addition to the Xbox 360, there is an iPod docking station and a cellphone that doubles as a \"smart key\" to start the engine. In at least one respect, the Urge might be the perfect car: it burns no gasoline while parked for game playing; it generates no emissions; it lines up in no traffic jams. It can virtually roll through the streets of Las Vegas or spin around the Nürburgring. Its version of Gotham Racing can even run uptown on the parts of Broadway that are one-way heading downtown, a special thrill for Manhattan drivers. With a wireless connection, in theory, two Urges could be parked side-by-side for competition like the old racing games at the arcade in Atlantic City. Thanks to the Internet, the same thing could be done even if the Urges were half a world apart. The game encourages stylish driving. Good driving through the curves earns the driver style points, called Kudos, that can be redeemed for a better vehicle. According to the Microsoft programmers, power sliding, pulling off a 360-degree spin, getting air time, drafting and getting up on two wheels \"will earn gamers Kudos points for their style and skill.\" Too bad the real automotive world doesn't work this way. Each car in the game is made up of 80,000 polygons and takes eight days of programming by its creators, who are holed up in the London studio of Bizarre Creations. Real-world details include gauges that move and realistic bug-smash streaks on the windshield. Oddly, the Urge itself is not among the cars you can drive on the screen. That will probably be remedied soon. Project Gotham players and programmers regularly produce new cars that can be downloaded. The Urge's notion of car-as-video game is not unprecedented. A similar concept, the Scion Speedster -- a red Scion xA show car built by 5 Axis Productions in Huntington Beach, Calif. -- was displayed at the Specialty Equipment Market Association trade show in Las Vegas last fall. The Speedster also has an open panel in the doors -- and two Xboxes running the Forza racing game onboard. The two cars simply evolved at the same time, Mr. Cupit said. He prefers his version of the idea. \"We tried to take seriously designing the door glass to protect the occupants from wind and rain, and also vehicle ingress-egress,\" he said. \"Our door moves up and down to ease entry into the car, for example.\" \"We often visit tuner and customizing shows to see what young people are thinking about,\" Mr. Cupit said. \"The Urge helps reinvent the sports car for the next generation of young people.\" Observing young people at auto shows, it is impossible not to note that they pay more attention to how their cars look and sound than how fast they go. The investment tends to go into electronics and colorful bolt-on parts, rather than into making the engine run faster and more furious. Maybe more automakers should put Xboxes in their cars. General Motors and Ford might stir up interest by tucking Xbox 360's into all their trunks."

                "REDMOND, Wash. — Microsoft is betting it has a new way to win the wallets of consumers. The company on Tuesday introduced the new version of its Xbox video game console. The Xbox has been one of Microsoft’s few undeniable consumer hits of the last decade, a product that was not just a credible entry into the games business but also a sign of the innovation possible at a company that is rarely seen as an inventive thinker. “I think of Xbox as the accidental success out of Microsoft,” said James McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester Research, who added that the connection Microsoft has formed with the players of its current Xbox is “much deeper than any relationship Microsoft has ever achieved before.”  The new console, the Xbox One, will enter a market very different from the one its predecessor, the Xbox 360, entered nearly eight years ago, when there was no iPad, smartphones had keyboards and mobile gaming devices were primitive at best.  Today, video games can be played almost anywhere, on any device, with the biggest possible audience of online friends and without the aid of a costly gaming console. The last year or two has been bumpy for Microsoft’s consumer efforts. The Windows 8 operating system software and the Surface tablet-computing devices got a tepid reception from the public when they went on sale last fall.  The company’s mobile phone efforts have been largely ignored. And even Bing, Microsoft’s Internet search engine, has failed to close a wide gap with Google, the market leader.  Microsoft, though, could see better results with the Xbox. With it, it hopes it can reassert the living room as the place where people can still get the best gaming experience, complete with eye-popping graphics and innovative methods for controlling games. It is also a place where Microsoft’s technology can be at the center of a home entertainment system and the funnel through which people gain access to online video. Microsoft has sold more than 76 million of the device’s current incarnation, the Xbox 360 worldwide, compared with almost 100 million Wii consoles from Nintendo and more than 70 million PlayStation 3s from Sony.  The company also controls what may be the most valuable asset in console gaming, Xbox Live, a subscription-based online service with 48 million members who use it to play games against one another and watch movies.  “You can do a lot of things on the phone and a lot of things on tablets,” said John Taylor, an analyst at Arcadia Investment. But, he said, “you can’t do the same kinds of things on those devices” that you can on a television screen. Microsoft plans to develop its own original, live-action television series, which will be accessible through the Xbox. The series will be made in partnership with the director Steven Spielberg and will be based on the popular Halo video game franchise.  The company is also working with the National Football League to develop an app for Xbox that lets players interact with their fantasy football teams while watching a live game. In an interview, Don A. Mattrick, the president of Microsoft’s interactive entertainment business, said that he recognized the growing appeal of mobile devices for gaming and that Microsoft would aggressively tie smartphones and tablets into the experience of using its console. He became most animated when talking about the possibilities of the new Xbox for providers of video programming. “We’re going to the take the form from a one-way experience pushed through a straw to where you can communicate back and make it interactive,” Mr. Mattrick said.  Even if it is a wild success, the new Xbox is likely to have a bigger impact on consumer perception than it will on Microsoft’s overall sales. The Xbox remains a small slice of the company’s business, which is still dominated by sales of Windows, Office and other software. The company’s games division represented only 4 percent of its operating profit. At an event in a carnival tent on its corporate campus, Microsoft did not say how much the new system would cost or how publishing partners would charge for games, which typically start at around $60 for high-end game consoles.  A major feature of the new Xbox, which is expected to hit store shelves in time for the holiday season, will be a new generation of Kinect, the camera-based motion-control sensor introduced several years ago as an Xbox 360 accessory. The new Kinect will come with every Xbox One. Traditional retail sales of games have come under pressure in recent years as mobile devices like the iPhone and iPad have invaded their turf with free and low-cost games. While many gamers dismiss those offerings as inferior to console games, the games have nevertheless tapped into a huge audience of players who may never have played on an Xbox or Sony’s PlayStation. The games business could use a jolt. Total United States retail sales of game hardware and software fell 25 percent to $495.2 million in April from $657.5 million a year earlier, according to estimates by NPD Group, a research firm. That figure does not include the sale of downloadable content over the Internet. Alex St. John, an entrepreneur who worked on Microsoft’s pre-Xbox game efforts, says he is pessimistic about prospects for gaming consoles. “They’re coming out with the latest and greatest stone tool,” Mr. St. John said. “The new console that trumps the old console is called the Apple iPad. This generation of kids loves mobile games.”"

                "Three months after surprising the video game industry with strong sales of its first console, the Microsoft Corporation will dispatch its chairman, Bill Gates, to Tokyo this week to introduce its assault on an inhospitable Japanese market. Not since the industry's early days, when Atari competed for space in video arcades, has a major American game company tried to dethrone Japanese hardware makers on their own turf. When it begins selling its Xbox game system in Japan on Friday, Microsoft will try to use the star power of Mr. Gates and a lineup of specialized games to battle the leaders, Sony and Nintendo. Many industry insiders predict that the Xbox, which has sold more than 1.5 million units in North America since November, will face tough going in Japan, where American software companies have found tremendous difficulties merely putting their games onto store shelves. ''You are talking about a closed market and going up against two very strong, very entrenched competitors,'' said Heath A. Terry, a game software analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston. ''For Microsoft to expect significant success early on in that market is unrealistic.'' The Xbox has other strikes against it for Japanese consumers, who buy about a third of the world's game products. Analysts worry that the console is too big for the living room in a country where smaller gadgets rule. And at about $260, the Xbox costs $40 more than Sony's PlayStation2 and $75 more than Nintendo's GameCube. Yet analysts and software makers acknowledge that Microsoft, the world's No. 1 software company, managed the North American rollout of the Xbox better than they had expected. They also noted that it has deep pockets and has shown unflagging persistence in entering other businesses. The company has already made one significant adjustment specifically for Japan: after criticism from early testers, it built smaller game controllers, with buttons closer together, to better fit the hands of the average Japanese player. Peter Moore, president and chief operating officer for Sega of America, the American division of the Japanese games publisher, said Microsoft's early success in North America gave the company a fighting chance in Japan and Europe, where the Xbox goes on sale on March 14. ''It's eerily reminiscent of the power of the launch of the PlayStation,'' he said, referring to Sony's first console. ''The way a powerful global company can attack an industry, get under its skin and change an industry.'' Hirohisa Ohura, who runs Microsoft's Xbox division in Japan, said the North American introduction had proved that the company could compete in the video game business. While calling Japan ''the most challenging market'' for the Xbox, he said Microsoft would keep chipping away at its competitors for the loyalty of Japanese game players. ''U.S. companies coming into Japan as a game vendor tended to fail and walk away real quick,'' Mr. Ohura said. ''We're not willing to give up at any point. Once we're in this business, we're in here to win.'' In its quest for the buzz that makes or breaks video games, Microsoft set up hundreds of Xbox kiosks in Tokyo and Osaka earlier this month. And for the introduction on Friday, Mr. Gates himself will stump for the Xbox at an event similar to his appearance last November at the opening of the Toys ''R'' Us store in Times Square. Microsoft began taking advance orders on Feb. 2 for consoles, including 50,000 special edition systems with a translucent case and a silver-plated key chain engraved with the autograph of Mr. Gates -- an accessory that has been mocked on online message boards and game publications. Sony, the consumer electronics giant, has an enormous head start on Microsoft. By Dec. 31, Sony said, it had shipped 25 million of its next-generation consoles, the PlayStation2, including 10 million to North America and 8 million to Japan. ''The burden isn't on our company to compete with them; the burden is significantly on Microsoft to compete with us,'' said Molly Smith, a spokeswoman for Sony Computer Entertainment America, the company's American division. The list of best-selling software is dominated by titles that run on the PlayStation2. Yet while they have capitalized on Sony's success in North America, large American game publishers have found the Japanese market difficult to penetrate and have been forced to cooperate with Japanese publishers to develop games specifically for Japan and have games sold there. Electronic Arts is the No. 1 publisher of PlayStation2 titles in North America, but only No. 7 in Japan. ''The secret in Japan is getting product that's culturally appealing to Japanese consumers,'' said Stan McKee, chief financial officer of Electronic Arts. Microsoft has forged partnerships of its own with more than 90 Japanese publishers, but still faces an uphill battle. Because of Sony's lead, analysts said, Microsoft will consider its introduction a success if it wins close to 20 percent of the Japanese market."

                "Reaching out to millions of aspiring game developers around the world, Microsoft plans today to announce a contest that will award $10,000 and the opportunity to entice millions of eyeballs to the next great digital diversion for the company’s Xbox 360. In addition to the game console’s snazzy graphics, the Xbox Live online service has been the most important component of the Xbox 360’s success since its debut in 2005. And perhaps the most popular aspect of Xbox Live has been the service’s arcade component, which allows users to download and play smaller, relatively simpler games like Uno and Geometry Wars that usually cost less than $10. (By contrast, top-end games can sell in stores for around $60.) The popularity of Xbox Live Arcade has in turn attracted the attention of game developers looking to create the next Tetris or Minesweeper. Late last year, Microsoft introduced a suite of software tools for making so-called casual games called XNA.  And so at a game makers’ convention in San Francisco, Microsoft plans to announce a contest akin to the television show “Project Greenlight” that will award a cash prize and a potential slot on Xbox Live Arcade to the best new game created with XNA tools. The company intends to announce the winner of the contest, called “Dream-Build-Play,” in August.  “This competition highlights the power of XNA and the popularity of the Xbox Live Arcade service with its millions of users,” Aaron Greenberg, Microsoft’s group product manager for the Xbox 360 and Xbox Live, said in a telephone interview.  To help increase the popularity of casual games, Microsoft will also announce the introduction of a new 512-megabyte portable storage device for the Xbox 360. The previous portable storage unit contained only 64 megabytes of data, and so Xbox Live Arcade games had been limited to an official size of 50 megabytes. With the new unit, Microsoft will also raise the official size limit on Xbox Live Arcade games to 150 megabytes, allowing enhanced graphics, sound and artificial intelligence. SETH SCHIESEL"

                "Raising the ante in the video game wars, Microsoft is bringing out a new version of the Xbox 360 game machine that has a bigger hard drive, better high-definition video support and a stylish black finish, not an insignificant feature in a world where looking cool ranks high. The idea is to appeal to an elite class of hardcore game players who would like a little more of everything.   “Today’s games-and-entertainment enthusiast has an insatiable appetite for digital high-definition content,” said Peter Moore, corporate vice president for Microsoft’s interactive entertainment business, in Redmond, Wash.   The Xbox 360 Elite, which is to be announced today and will be in stores in late April, will have a list price of $479, or $80 more than the Xbox 360 Pro and $180 more than the basic Xbox 360. The new model has a 120-gigabyte hard drive, in contrast to the standard model’s 20-gigabyte drive. It also has a high-definition multimedia interface port and cable and a wireless controller and headset. Current Xbox 360 owners can buy the new 120-gigabyte hard drive as a separate accessory for $179.  Microsoft is clearly hoping to fill what it sees as a hole at the top end of the market. The Nintendo Wii has been outselling the PlayStation 3 from Sony and the Xbox 360 in recent months, but that system is largely positioned as a family-friendly game machine that can be purchased for $50 less than the lowest-priced Xbox. The Sony system is priced higher than both the Nintendo and the Microsoft systems, with the cheapest model priced at $499.  Both Microsoft and Sony have positioned their consoles as entertainment hubs, not just for playing sophisticated video games but also for listening to music and viewing downloaded movies and television shows.   John Rodman, group product manager for the Xbox platform and Xbox Live, pointed to a recent Microsoft survey that revealed that nearly 40 percent of the time that Xbox 360 users spent with their consoles was for activities other than gaming.   Yet when it comes to gaming, Xbox 360 users are serious, Mr. Rodman says. Six out of 10 Xbox 360 users use Xbox Live, Microsoft’s online gaming service.   “We don’t feel like the Wii customer and the Xbox customer are the same thing,” he said. “We think that as soon as the Wii customer turns 14 they want something else.”  James L. McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester Research, said that Microsoft hoped to encourage customers to spend more money downloading movies and games, which require considerable hard-drive space. "

                "LOS ANGELES  Reaching out beyond hardcore video game players to everyday consumers, Microsoft outlined an entertainment strategy on Monday for making the company’s Xbox 360 game console a gateway for movies, television and social networking. In a media presentation on the eve of E3, the video game industry’s biggest North American convention, Microsoft announced new relationships with the social networking giants Facebook and Twitter as well as Sky, the big British satellite television provider that is a unit of the News Corporation.  Microsoft announced that Facebook users would be able to access their profiles and share photos on their television through the Xbox Live network and that Twitter devotees would also be able to post and read messages through the service.  More far-reaching was Microsoft’s new deal with Sky, under which Xbox Live users in Britain will be able to watch live television, including professional soccer, over an Internet version of the Sky service. Not every channel available over satellite will be available over Xbox Live, but the offering will include dozens of stations, Microsoft executives said. Users will be able to watch television in a virtual party room with their friends, discussing the program as they are watching, they said.  Microsoft has long sought a bigger role in home television, going so far in years past as to try to build its own set-top box business. Partnering with Sky represents a back door into the television market. The company has also recognized how Nintendo has expanded the traditional audience for video games with its innovative motion-sensitive controller for the Wii. Microsoft provided the first public demonstration of its futuristic Project Natal, which it hopes will usher in an age of completely controller-free gaming.  Using a sophisticated camera, infrared sensors and voice recognition software, Natal allows users to control a game or other programs, like a virtual painting studio, merely by waving their arms, speaking to the system and moving around. Microsoft did not say when the technology would become available. Microsoft also demonstrated some of its coming big games, including Forza Motorsport 3, the suspense-thriller Alan Wake and a new version of its biggest hit, Halo. Hideo Kojima, the developer behind the Metal Gear series, said that the next major installment in that franchise would be available for Xbox 360, a coup for Microsoft because previous Metal Gear games had been exclusive to Sony game machines."

Current Xbox 360 owners can buy the new 120-gigabyte hard drive as a separate accessory for $179. Microsoft is clearly hoping to fill what it sees as a hole at the top end of the market. The Nintendo Wii has been outselling the PlayStation 3 from Sony and the Xbox 360 in recent months, but that system is largely positioned as a family-friendly game machine that can be purchased for $50 less than the lowest-priced Xbox. The Sony system is priced higher than both the Nintendo and the Microsoft systems, with the cheapest model priced at $499. Both Microsoft and Sony have positioned their consoles as entertainment hubs, not just for playing sophisticated video games but also for listening to music and viewing downloaded movies and television shows. John Rodman, group product manager for the Xbox platform and Xbox Live, pointed to a recent Microsoft survey showing that nearly 40 percent of the time Xbox 360 users spent with their consoles was for activities other than gaming. Yet when it comes to gaming, Xbox 360 users are serious, Rodman says. Six out of 10 Xbox 360 users use Xbox Live, Microsoft's online gaming service. \"We don't feel like the Wii customer and the Xbox customer are the same thing,\" he said. \"We think that as soon as the Wii customer turns 14 they want something else.\" James McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester Research, said that Microsoft hoped to encourage customers to spend more money downloading movies and games, which require considerable hard-drive space."

                "Raising the ante in the video game wars, Microsoft is bringing out a new version of the Xbox 360 game machine that has a bigger hard drive, better high-definition video support and a stylish black finish, not an insignificant feature in a world where looking cool ranks high. The idea is to appeal to an elite class of hard-core game players who would like a little more of everything. \"Today's games and entertainment enthusiast has an insatiable appetite for digital high-definition content,\" said Peter Moore, corporate vice president for Microsoft's interactive entertainment business, in Redmond, Washington. The Xbox 360 Elite, which was announced Wednesday and will be in U.S. stores in late April, will have a list price of $479, or $80 more than the Xbox 360 Pro and $180 more than the basic Xbox 360. The new model has a 120-gigabyte hard drive, in contrast to the standard model's 20-gigabyte drive.

                " NEW YORK — Buyers of the Xbox 360, Microsoft's second-generation video game console, will expect to play big, expensive marquee games like \"Call of Duty 2\" from Activision and \"Madden NFL 06\" by Electronic Arts. But Microsoft is also banking on them to play small arcade-style video games, purchased and downloaded from the Internet. Unlike its competitors, the Sony PlayStation 2 and Nintendo GameCube, the new Xbox, which goes on sale on Nov. 22, can play games on two separate tracks. One is the familiar terrain of big-budget, deeply immersive games that feel more like interactive movies than games. The other is a return to the video game's arcade roots. But the arcade games are not simple, said Greg Canessa, group manager of Xbox Live Arcade, part of the Xbox division.\"Arcade games are really miniature Xbox 360 games,\" he said. The price is somewhat miniaturized as well. To develop the arcade games cost $100,000 to $200,000, compared with $15 million to $20 million for the larger games. The arcade games will be sold only online, downloadable through the Xbox's broadband-only Internet connection. Microsoft has not officially announced prices for the games, but it is widely expected that they will cost $5 to $10. By contrast, new Xbox games sold at retailers like Best Buy are likely to cost $60, or about $10 more than previous Xbox games, according to some game publishers. The new machines, slimmer and more powerful than the original Xbox released in 2001, will cost $300 for a basic model and $400 for a model with a 20-gigabyte hard drive. They will also be able to play DVDs, CDs and standard music files, including MP3 and Windows Media Audio files, as well as display digital snapshots on a TV screen. Those functions and the arcade-type gaming feature are central to Microsoft's strategy to reach a broader family market, beyond the young male players who have been the Xbox's primary audience.To do that, Peter Moore, vice president for marketing at Xbox International, said Microsoft would eliminate the need for credit cards in making online purchases of games, accessories and upgrades. Instead of credit cards, the Xbox Live online service will accept Microsoft value cards that can be bought in various denominations online or at retail and convenience stores, Moore said. The value cards would function, in effect, like tokens in an arcade. \"We have to get credit cards out of the way,\" he said. \"We've got to broaden this to younger demographics.\" Another big selling point for the 360 is its enhanced Internet connectivity through the Xbox Live service.Microsoft will give Xbox 360 owners a free subscription to Xbox Live Silver, which gives players access to the online system's features, including the ability to buy and download games. A Gold membership, at $50 a year, permits users to play games with others over the Internet. Canessa, the group manager of Xbox Live Arcade, said that each arcade game could play at 1080i high definition and that most could take advantage of the 360's ability to communicate with other players over a broadband Internet connection. \"We will have from 12 to 15 games by launch,\" Canessa said. At least 75 percent, he added, will be capable of being played live online by more than one player.Each Xbox 360, he said, will include a free copy of the full version of \"Hexic HD,\" an arcade-style puzzle game developed by Alexey Pajitnov, the creator of \"Tetris.\" \"We created a whole market, a whole new world, for downloadable games,\" Canessa said. While online arcade games have proved popular on personal computers, Canessa said he believed that the 360's embrace of arcade games would further invigorate independent game design. \"The indie game developers is one of the opportunities I'm most excited about,\" he said. \"You have small, independent, three guys in a garage making games, totally innovating. It's the Sundance Film Festival, if you will, of games.\" "

                " SEATTLE — In a bid to make its games unit profitable by 2007, Microsoft is planning to start selling a more expensive version of its Xbox game console this autumn. The premium Xbox 360 console will sell for $399.99 in the United States, nearly three times the price of the current Xbox, according to an announcement made by Microsoft on Wednesday. The premium console will sell for399.99, or $490.67, in Continental Europe, while its scaled-back version, called \"Xbox 360 Core System,\" will sell for $299.99 in the United States and299.99 in Europe. Microsoft is counting on the new releases of its console to make its video game unit profitable by 2007, according to Robert Bach, senior vice president for Microsoft's home and entertainment division. The game unit of Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, has lost $2.8 billion in the last three years, while Sony's rival console, the PlayStation, is profitable. Bach predicted that the Xbox 360 would outsell Sony's PlayStation 3, which is scheduled for release next year, even though the PlayStation 2 has outsold the Xbox by nearly 4 to 1. Various Xbox accessories, like a 20-gigabyte detachable hard drive and a wireless controller that will be delivered with the premium version of the console, will also be available for purchase as an add-on for the less expensive \"core\" console. Microsoft is also planning to sell other Xbox accessories, like a wireless controller and TV remote, a headset for the Xbox Live online service and an Ethernet cable for high-speed Internet connections. The company said that it remained on target to ship the new Xbox to stores in North America, Europe and Japan in time for the upcoming holiday season, ahead of Sony's PlayStation 3, which is slated to replace the PlayStation 2 in the spring. Bach noted that both new versions of the Xbox would support high-definition visuals and play music and movies. These features were not part of the original Xbox release, which cost $299 four years ago but now sells for $150. Matt Rosoff, an analyst at the independent research firm Directions on Microsoft, said he doubted that enthusiasts would balk at the price increase for the new releases.\"Hard-core gamers will be on board,\" Rosoff said. \"I think the sticker shock might be in the larger audience Microsoft is trying to reach,\" like casual game players and neophytes, he added. Microsoft sells its current Xbox console at a loss because its primary goal was to break into the lucrative game market. It makes money selling games, but does not expect its home and entertainment division to post profits regularly until 2007. \"They need to not lose a lot of money on the console this time,\" said Ben Bajarin, an analyst at Creative Strategies in Campbell, California. \"They'd like to get closer to a small margin of profit on the console.\" The core console will not be able to play games designed for the original Xbox unless a consumer spends $99.99 to add a hard drive. Microsoft has asked developers working on future games to make them in such a way that they could be played on both the fully loaded and basic versions of the console. Pricing for the new Xbox in Japan, where Microsoft sells just a few hundred consoles a week, will not be announced until the Tokyo Game Show in September, Bach said. "

                " SAN JOSE, California — The tit-for- tat battle for customers between Sony and Microsoft continued Thursday as the Japanese electronics group announced plans to introduce an online gaming service when its PlayStation 3 video game console is released in the fall. The news of the service, which lets users buy games and communicate and compete with other players via the Web, comes days after Tokyo-based Sony said that it would delay the release of its next-generation PlayStationconsole until November, putting it a year behind Microsoft's popular Xbox 360. The much-awaited start had originally been scheduled for the spring and the news, on March 15, prompted Microsoft to announce this week that it was more than doubling shipments of the Xbox 360. Phil Harrison, president of worldwide studios for Sony Computer Entertainment, said that the basic level of Sony's online service, known internally as PlayStation Network Platform, would be free, and would allow users to play against each other online, e-mail and chat with friends. Additional game services and premium content will be made available to users who pay a subscription fee, Harrison said. Sony, one of the world's leading technology manufacturers and entertainment companies, is hoping to retain its dominance over the roughly $30 billion global video game market with the PS3. Microsoft introduced the Xbox 360 game console in November. The company's Xbox Live subscription service, which offers game downloads and online play, has been a hit on the new machine and Sony had been widely expected to offer a similar service. Built in collaboration with Sony Online Entertainment, which already offers PC game downloads and a marketplace for trading virtual assets, the service was inspired by businesses like the online auction site eBay and the online retailer Amazon.com, where communities of users contribute ratings and recommendations. It also steals a page from social networking sites like Myspace.com, which has attracted millions of users. \"We have to fall into step with consumer expectations,\" said Harrison, who said the social aspects of the network promise to get people more involved in gaming. With broadband adoption on the rise and television viewership dropping, advertisers are exploring the possibility of buying ad space in games much like they now do on the Web. \"This can provide a tremendous revenue stream for our industry,\" Harrison said. Video game makers, which have seen sales fall as gamers wait and save for new consoles, have been under pressure to find new ways to offset rising game development costs. Microsoft said Tuesday that Xbox Live had logged more than 10 million downloads.More than 85 percent of Xbox 360 consoles that are connected to the Internet have downloaded games, trailers and videos from the subscription service, Microsoft said. Downloads appeal to many game makers, because they can cut costs by selling direct to consumers. Online distribution also gives them a way to head off piracy and used game sales by providing a way to check that the player of a game is also its owner. Anita Frazier, an analyst with NPD Group, a market research company, said most publishers were \"treading lightly\" into direct online sales of games because they do not want to alienate retailers, but added that such services would likely open the market for more games.$@ "

                "Executives at Microsoft are fond of saying that its subscription gaming service, Xbox Live, should be thought of as a cable channel. They want Xbox to be seen not merely as a gaming machine for teenagers, but as a media portal for parents and grandparents, too. The company is even producing shows for users: it is in the middle of the second season of “1 vs. 100,” an interactive version of a game show that was on NBC. The content ambitions do not end there. Microsoft has held in-depth talks with the Walt Disney Company about a programming deal with ESPN, according to people close to the talks, who requested anonymity because the talks were intended to be private. For a per-subscriber fee, ESPN could provide live streams of sporting events, similar to the ones available through ESPN 360, a service that is available from some high-speed Internet providers. Microsoft could also create some interactive games in association with ESPN, the people said. One of the people said the deal was not imminent. The companies declined to comment. Already, video game consoles are putting a new emphasis on the video, rather than the game.  The roughly 20 million monthly members of Xbox Live can surf Facebook, browse an online mall of movies and TV episodes and, if they pay, watch Netflix.  “It’s 20 million connected living rooms,” said Marc Whitten, the general manager of Xbox Live. Similarly, users of the Sony PlayStation can tune into BBC shows and see Weather Channel updates, as well as stream Netflix. Last week, Netflix extended its streaming service to the Nintendo Wii.  Among the many companies that want to transport the on-demand qualities of the Internet into the living room  the over-the-top model, in industry parlance  the console makers have a significant head start. Nearly 60 percent of American homes now have at least one console, according to the consulting firm Deloitte, up from 44 percent three years ago. “For both of the big guys, it’s about extending the value of the hardware platform,” said Mike McGuire, a vice president for the research firm Gartner, referring to Microsoft and Sony. “The devices are hooked to TVs and have broadband connections, and there are more and more opportunities to license movies and TV shows and deliver them in over-the-top models.” Microsoft said this month that it had sold 39 million Xbox 360 consoles around the world. About half sign into Xbox Live each month. At that size, “it starts to feel like a cable network,” said Mark Kroese, who oversees Xbox advertising sales for Microsoft. The company does not specify how many members pay for access to premium services like Netflix; basic functions of Xbox Live are free. The company says it regularly counts more than a million concurrent users  and topped out at 2.2 million at one point during Christmas week last month. That compares favorably to some of the top channels on cable, like TBS and the Cartoon Network, which reach about one million viewers at any given time, according to the Nielsen Company.  The comparisons are crude at best because many of Xbox Live’s users are playing games rather than watching video. No third-party measurement exists, because ratings companies like Nielsen do not yet track the service fully. But there is no doubt that consoles are expanding their domain, something that is evident in Mr. Whitten’s vision of the service: “The entertainment you want, the people you care about, wherever you are.” The addition of Netflix in late 2008 was an important step into the entertainment arena for Xbox, and perhaps a precursor to Microsoft’s current talks with Hollywood producers. Without releasing specific numbers, Mr. Whitten said the streaming movies and TV service were “very, very popular,” including in his own household. Mr. Whitten said Microsoft wanted to be a bigger player in television and film viewing. He declined to comment on the conversations with Disney but said more than once that “there’s going to be a ton of experimentation around business models and rights.” “Our goal is, really, how can we get as much content there as possible,” he said. Disney is not alone in showing an interest in the console market. Many companies sell TV episodes and film rentals through Microsoft’s online store, and Web video ventures are clamoring to have a place on the service. Console makers have a long way to go to be considered replacements for cable subscriptions, but, at the very least, they could put a dent in the time spent viewing traditional TV. The interactive game show “1 vs. 100” drew well over 100,000 concurrent users at times during its first season last year, according to Microsoft’s internal data. During the second season, which began in November, two-hour TV-style trivia competitions are scheduled on Tuesday and Friday nights. A voice-over announcer, shown onscreen as an avatar, provides live color commentary. Like the defunct NBC show, the game has a contestant, “The One,” and a “Mob” of 100 other players. Members of the audience can watch passively or play along, improving their odds of being picked to play for prizes. Unlike on the live-action TV show, every player on Xbox is represented by a cartoonish avatar. Dave McCarthy, a general manager at Microsoft Game Studios, said the scheduled TV-style shows provided a guarantee that “you’re a part of something bigger.” Beyond the game show realm, Microsoft also exclusively shows “The Guild,” a sitcom that it bills as “Seinfeld” meets video game culture. It stars its creator, the actress Felicia Day, and is sponsored by Sprint. For advertisers like Sprint, online communities like Xbox Live are another arena to pursue consumers. Within “1 vs. 100” there are 15- and 30-second commercial breaks like on TV. Those spots account for about 15 percent of the service’s advertising revenue; most of the rest comes from ads on Xbox Live navigation pages, like display ads on Web sites.  In November, Nielsen started to track “1 vs. 100” play and ad views. The pilot program “is the tip of the iceberg,” said Gerardo Guzman, a director for Nielsen Games; eventually, he hopes to generate TV-style ratings. Mr. Kroese said Xbox advertisers were “very interested in being able to compare the media buy on Xbox to other media buys they do.” Microsoft says nearly half of Xbox Live members use its entertainment content; the rest mostly play multiplayer games. But it expects that more of its users will try the entertainment side and the line between them will blur further. “I don’t think there’s a real difference between a game and ‘Lost.’ Or a game and ‘American Idol.’ They’re all ways we spend our leisure time,” Mr. Whitten said.  Over time, he predicted, “these narrow swim lanes  games, music, movies, etc.  will dissolve.”"

                "LOS ANGELES, July 5 — In what may be one of the costliest consumer warranty repairs in history, Microsoft announced on Thursday that it would spend up to $1.15 billion to repair failing Xbox 360 game machine consoles. While the company would not say how many units were failing, Robbie Bach, president of Microsoft’s entertainment and devices division, said that there have been an “unacceptable high number of repairs.” The majority of Xbox 360 owners, he said, have not experienced hardware failure.  Company officials said that Microsoft had sold 11.6 million Xbox 360 units by the end of June, shy of the 12 million units the company had predicted. The Xbox 360, which first went of sale in November 2005, is currently the best-selling game machine in the United States, according to NPD, a market research firm. The size of the anticipated repair bill suggests that a third to as many as half of the machines are flawed.  Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., said it would take a charge of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion against earnings in the quarter ended June 30. Consumers know they have a problem if three red flashing lights appear on the console. Gamers on online forums have been referring to the event as “the Red Ring of Death” because the machine then shuts down.  The company declined to explain the nature of the failure, but said that it was not caused by a single problem in the console, which it said contained 1,700 components and 500 million transistors. The company also said there were no health or safety concerns involved. The problem began to appear over the last three to four months, Mr. Bach said, after “significant usage” of the consoles. He said the company has taken steps to correct the problem in new devices. Microsoft said it would extend the warranty of the game console to three years to customers worldwide. Previously, products sold in the United States were covered by a one-year warranty, while Xbox 360 units sold in Europe had a two-year warranty.  In addition, customers who have had their consoles repaired because of the “three flashing lights” problem will be reimbursed for the cost of the repairs. Microsoft has succeeded in establishing the Xbox brand against the better known Sony PlayStation and other game machines. The Xbox and its successor, the Xbox 360, was the software maker’s first major foray into hardware. Although sales are small relative to the rest of Microsoft’s revenue, the Xbox has been an important venture for the company and was viewed by many analysts as Microsoft’s attempt to compete with the likes of Sony and Apple for control of electronics and entertainment within homes.  The device can be used to access the Internet and view movies. Microsoft said its entertainment and devices division reported an operating loss of $315 million on $929 million in revenue for the three-month period that ended in March, and analysts have estimated that the company lost about $6 billion getting a foothold in the game machine industry.  A new Xbox 360 with a 20-gigabyte hard drive sells for about $400, but other versions cost about $300.  The announcement comes on the eve of the E3 Media and Business Summit, the video-game industry’s major trade show, to be held next week in Los Angeles. “This is bound to affect discussions between Microsoft and its developers and retailers,” said Richard Doherty, a partner in the research company Envisioneering Group."

                "One of the enduring attractions of comic books and graphic novels is the ease with which they explain the universe. Evil is identifiable, external and fairly simple to vanquish with the application of the appropriate superpowers. And sometimes, as in the case of ABC Family’s new comic-based series “The Middleman,” evil is downright funny. In “Middleman’s” first episode, last week, a slimy, many-eyed, multitentacled creature erupts in a DNA lab. Later, evil’s personification is a mobster ape with a machine gun. These over-the-top creatures are more comic than threatening. Usually the phrase “cartoonish violence” is a pejorative; here it’s a compliment. “The Middleman,” written as a graphic novel by Javier Grillo-Marxuach, who has also written for the series “Lost” and “Medium,” stars Matt Keeslar in the title role, a straight-arrow, milk-drinking former member of the Navy Seals who stands between us and horrors we’re not even aware of, fighting evil “so you don’t have to.” He dresses like a Canadian Mountie and delivers his lines with the stone-face confidence of a young Peter Graves. Early on, he explains the world to his protégée. “You know how in comic books there’s all kinds of mad scientists and aliens and androids and monsters who want to either take over or destroy the world?” he asks. “Well, it really does work like that.” This is news to Wendy Watson (Natalie Morales), an art-school graduate and temp secretary whose calm in the face of the multitentacled slime creature  she stabs it with a letter opener  inspires the Middleman to recruit her. “You’re good under pressure,” he says. She asks, “Are you hitting on me?” There is some sexual tension between these two, but you hope it won’t become a big part of the story; there’s much more interesting material here. “Middleman” is full of hilarious throwaways, as when our hero, preparing to drink a glass of “cool refreshing milk” with some bad guys, empties his pockets  of grenades, flamethrowers and a crossbow.  The genius is in the details. When the Middleman asks Wendy if she has experience with firearms, and she says she’s a pacifist, he looks at her fingers. Their calluses tell him that she is a veteran Xbox player. “You probably have better hand-eye than a bush sniper,” he concludes. “Middleman” skillfully incorporates real-life details into its fantastic scenarios. Its characters aren’t just Manichaean warriors; they also live the kinds of lives that people read comic books to escape from. “Did I get any calls?” Wendy asks her roommate after a rough day at the office. The roommate says: “Yeah. Your mom called to ask if you’re a lesbian.” That would be the mom whom Wendy describes as “on me 24/7 to quit painting, move back to Orlando, meet a good man, eat fried foods, swell up like a tick and start squeezing out calves like Elsie mainlining fertility drugs.” Then there’s the motive of the mad scientist who created the gun-toting ape; she’s just trying to compensate for federal cuts to her research grants. Saving the world is easy; making a world as complex and funny as this one is the real feat of “Middleman.” THE MIDDLEMAN ABC Family, Monday nights at 8, Eastern and Pacific times; 7, Central time. Created by Javier Grillo-Marxuach, based on his Viper Comics graphic novels, with illustrations by Les McClaine; directed by Jeremiah Chechik; Mr. Grillo-Marxuach and John Ziffren, executive producers; Hans Beimler, co-executive producer; Jon Pare, producer; Sarah Watson, co-producer; Mr. Chechik and Tracey Stern, supervising producers.

                "TOKYO, Dec. 16 - In the United States, Microsoft's Xbox 360 video game console has been so popular it is hard to keep on store shelves. But in Tokyo's neon-drenched Akihabara neighborhood, known as Electronics Town, there are plenty of the sleek white machines to go around, if you can find takers. At Yodobashi Camera, an eight-story electronics department store selling everything from hair curlers to home computer servers, a small corner display of Xbox 360's draws little attention from passing shoppers. It is not hard to figure out why. Lined up on a rack near the display are the only nine games sold for Xbox 360. But behind it are some 3,000 games, spread across six store aisles, for Microsoft's biggest rival here, the Sony PlayStation 2. \"Xbox doesn't even have Gran Turismo,\" said Shun'ichi Moriizumi, naming a popular auto racing game. One of the few shoppers to stop in front of the Xbox display, Mr. Moriizumi, a 22-year-old university student, said he came to see the Xbox 360, which went on sale here Dec. 10, 18 days after its debut in the United States. \"I like the graphics,\" he said \"But I'm not going to buy it, at least not today. I'm waiting until the new PlayStation comes out before deciding which to buy.\" That appears to be a common sentiment in Japan, the world's second-largest video game market after the United States. The Xbox 360 had a disappointing opening day in Japan. During the first weekend the Xbox 360 was in stores, Microsoft sold 62,135 of about 159,000 machines shipped, or about 39 percent, according to a Japanese market research company, Enterbrain. That pace was even slower than in 2002, when Microsoft introduced its earlier Xbox model in Japan, where it was considered a flop. Microsoft was hoping to make a bigger splash this time, not just because of the market's size here but also because of Japan's importance as a proving ground for new products. Japan is, after all, home to Microsoft's two biggest rivals in video games, Sony and Nintendo, and its software companies write many of the games played worldwide, from Super Mario Brothers to Final Fantasy. Winning over Japan's finicky consumers, who are known to reject games for seemingly minor shortcomings in performance and appearance, represents a coveted seal of approval, analysts say. So far, Microsoft has failed the test. As of June, the latest data available, 470,000 Xbox machines over all have been sold in Japan, versus 13 million in the United States, according to the market research site Famitsu.com. That gave Xbox a mere 2 percent slice of the 22 million game machines sold in Japan. By contrast, Xbox had a 25 percent share of the 52 million machines sold in the United States, according to Famitsu. Analysts say the biggest hurdle the Xbox 360 faces in Japan is the dominance of Sony and to a lesser extent Nintendo. Sony has 81 percent of the Japanese market; Nintendo has most of the rest, according to Famitsu. Worldwide, PlayStation's market share is about 68 percent; Xbox is in second place with 17 percent and Nintendo has the rest. Microsoft had hoped to steal a march by rolling out its next-generation XBox game machine ahead of its two Japanese rivals. Sony plans to sell its newest game console, PlayStation 3, in the spring, though the company will not say exactly when. Nintendo says it will release its new console, Revolution, in 2006. But Microsoft's strategy does not seem to be working, analysts say. One problem they note is that Microsoft introduced Xbox 360 before there was much game software to play on it. That makes the Xbox 360 less attractive next to the vastly larger number of games available for PlayStation. Microsoft says more games are in the pipeline, including the latest version of the popular Dead or Alive, which is supposed to go on sale here later this month. \"We didn't have a rocket start,\" said Asako Miyata, a spokeswoman in Japan for Microsoft. \"But we see sales steadily picking up as more games become available.\" Analysts say, however, that even when more games appear, Microsoft may have trouble luring first-time buyers because of the need to replace their game software libraries. Because so many consumers now own PlayStation 2, it would be easier for them to wait for the arrival of PlayStation 3, which would be able to play all their current games, . \"Sony has such a high penetration rate,\" said John Yang, an electronics analyst in Tokyo for Standard & Poor's rating agency. \"It is not uncommon for households here to have two or even three PS2's,\" he said, referring to the current PlayStation model. \"Why would an entire household want to switch to Xbox?\" Takashi Sudo, a manager for the video game department at the Yodobashi Camera store, said several hundred people showed up for the opening day of Xbox 360 at his store. But he said he expected a crowd at least five times as large for the PlayStation 3 debut in the spring. For that, he says, he will need to set up a line of special booths to handle the crunch. \"This is Sony's country,\" Mr. Sudo said. \"Xbox has to break into a market that Sony built.\""

                "SANTA MONICA, Calif., July 10 — As Microsoft executives played down the impact of an extensive repair program for defective Xbox 360 game machines, they announced several efforts to broaden the appeal of their machine to families.  Opening the annual E3 game conference here, Microsoft executives announced a deal to distribute films from the Walt Disney Company on Microsoft’s Xbox Live Internet service and outlined a broader array of games focused mostly on children and families.  Executives predicted that the company’s recently announced plan to spend up to $1.15 billion to fix defective Xbox 360 game machine would improve, not undermine, the system’s image with consumers.   “The important impact for us is that our customers know we’re going to support the console and support them and if they have issues, we’ll take care of it,” said Robert J. Bach, president of Microsoft’s entertainment and devices division, in an interview. “It won’t change what’s happening in the marketplace because the industry is about the games and we think we have the games that will get people really excited this year.”  As the game industry’s growth has slowed in recent years, game developers have tried to reach beyond the young male players who have been the target audience.  “We believe we have the best game lineup in video-game history for the holiday season,” said Mr. Bach. “You can look top to bottom and we think we have the goods to please any type of gamer.”  Part of Microsoft’s strategy has been to position the Xbox 360 as a living room media hub and an essential element of that plan has been allowing users to download films and television shows to the machine. Adding Disney to the roster of companies distributing movies and video programming over the Xbox Live service should help broaden the appeal of the game system to families with children. The same could be said of the new games Microsoft announced here, including a new installment of the company’s Viva Pinata game and a version of the Scene It? board game. Scene It? will come with a new controller for the Xbox 360 with large buttons and a simple layout that game novices, intimidated by a traditional game controller, may find easier to use “Part of our strategy is we want to win this generation and in order to do that we have to expand beyond the core gamer audience that we’ve had success with and that means appealing to the broad consumer market,” said Shane Kim, general manager of Microsoft Game Studios. The company also said it was developing a keyboard for the Xbox 360 controller. Currently, Xbox Live users send text messages using an on-screen keyboard. The company recently announced plans to integrate the popular Windows Live Messenger service with Xbox Live.  But even as Microsoft hopes to appeal to new sorts of users, the company wants to avoid neglecting the serious player. So Microsoft also said that the next version of the popular Resident Evil series from Capcom of Japan would also be designed to run on the Xbox 360.   In the past, Resident Evil games have run only on Nintendo and Sony consoles. Persuading Capcom to develop games for the Xbox 360 underlines the success Microsoft has had recently in attracting Japanese developers who had shied away from the American console. "

                "AFTER a 31-year-old Manhattan financial executive received Microsoft's Xbox video game system as a gift in January, he walked to a store and bought a half-dozen game titles. The video game industry would have been pleased to hear it. After he played those games a few times against computer-controlled opponents, he got a bit bored and signed up for Microsoft's Xbox Live service, which enabled him to play against other people online. The video game industry, again, would have been pleased. After a few months on the Xbox Live network, in May, he got a bit bored again. This time, however, he opened his Xbox and soldered in a chip that allowed him to change the console's basic computer code and bypass its internal security technology. After installing a new hard drive, he transferred about 3,000 MP3 music files to the system and downloaded illegal copies of 3,500 old-time arcade games. Then he installed the Linux operating system, which allowed him to use the box essentially as a personal computer. Needless to say, the video game industry would not have been pleased. When Microsoft released the Xbox in November 2001, it was heralded as far more than a game machine. Even as the Xbox took aim at Sony's PlayStation 2 game empire, the console was meant to lead Microsoft's broader invasion of the living room. Incorporating a hard drive, which made it more readily adaptable than other consoles, the Xbox had the potential to be a digital-entertainment nerve center. Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, said at the time, ''We're going to put new software that runs on Xbox that, both in the gaming dimension and other dimensions, will amaze people with the power that's in this box.'' That is happening, but not necessarily as Microsoft planned. All sorts of new software is indeed running on Xbox consoles these days, and they are in fact becoming home-entertainment hubs, but it is not Microsoft doing the amazing. Rather, an online confederacy apparently numbering in the thousands -- including accomplished hackers of varied motives and everyday technophiles like the Manhattan financial executive (who shared his experience on the condition of anonymity) -- is taking the lead. Those involved often call their efforts ''unleashing'' or ''unshackling'' -- freeing the Xbox to express its inner PC. Technology industry executives, however, often call such activity a bald attempt to hijack the Xbox illegally. It is a battle that involves many of the ethical and legal issues facing the technology and media industries at this digital moment. What rights do consumers have to tinker with products they own? How far should companies go to protect their intellectual property? What happens when the desires of consumers conflict with the business models of companies they patronize? Who gets to decide just what a particular product may be used for? The Xbox is a particularly attractive target for hackers because while it is essentially a standard PC modified to do only a few things, like play Xbox games, it is much cheaper than a PC. It is like an economy car modified to follow only a few roads -- but one potentially as powerful as a far more expensive model. In the Xbox, that power comes in the form of a 733-megahertz Intel processor, comparable to a midrange personal computer, and sophisticated graphics and audio systems. Its limited operating system, based on a version of Windows, can be used by a programmer to run simple software like a music player -- or the machine can run a new operating system altogether, namely Linux. ''The reality is that if you could bypass Microsoft's operating system you would end up with a fairly powerful computer for less than $200,'' the Manhattan financial executive said. In fact, Microsoft lowered the price for Xbox to $179.99 in May. In a sense, Xbox hackers are exploiting Microsoft's business model, which is to sell Xbox hardware at a loss (to build penetration of the system) and make the money back on royalties from the sale of Xbox software. A PC manufacturer like Dell, meanwhile, has to recoup its costs and generate a profit from the initial sale. So someone who buys the Xbox hardware, modifies it into a general-purpose computer and does not buy Xbox games potentially undermines not only Microsoft but also the personal computer industry. But that is not how some Xbox hackers think about it. ''Especially in Europe, computers are more expensive than they are here, and the Xbox is the cheapest computer you can get,'' Andrew Huang, author of a new book called ''Hacking the Xbox: An Introduction to Reverse Engineering,'' said in a telephone interview. ''Basically,'' he added by e-mail, ''once you have Linux, you have everything.'' It is unclear just how many Xbox hackers there are. Officials of the Interactive Digital Software Association, a trade group of video game publishers, said that Xbox hacking appeared more prevalent in parts of Asia than in North America. Michael Steil, a 24-year-old German who is project leader of a group that calls itself the Xbox Linux Project, said by e-mail that a full version of Linux software for the Xbox had been downloaded more than 220,000 times. Whatever the numbers, Microsoft does not appear eager to discuss Xbox hacking. In recent weeks, a Microsoft public relations representative repeatedly declined to make any company executives available to discuss the matter. Instead, the company issued a statement through a public relations firm that said in part: ''Microsoft is a company passionate about innovation and creativity. We are also very committed to respect for others' intellectual property and we request the same respect applied to our innovations.'' The statement made no reference to the potential use of hacked Xbox consoles as personal computers, saying Microsoft's ''primary concern'' was with the sale of modified chips for the boxes ''that enable game counterfeiting.'' And that is the area that most clearly raises legal issues. Although there are several methods, hacking an Xbox typically involves obtaining a special chip called a modchip, available on the Internet, and soldering it into the machine. (For those who find the process daunting, there are also vendors on the Internet who sell ''pre-modded'' Xbox units.) Modchips, of which there are several varieties, allow users to load new versions of the basic computer code, known as the BIOS, that tells the machine how to operate. A hacked BIOS generally incorporates modified versions of copyrighted Microsoft code and so is generally illegal. The main Web sites that deal with Xbox hacking do not include links to hacked BIOS, and hackers generally find their forbidden fruit in Internet chat rooms. Once the modchip is installed and the BIOS modified, the console can do a number of things it cannot do ''out of the box.'' Xbox games normally must be run from an optical disk, and a hacked Xbox can ''back up'' a game to the unit's hard drive and run the game without the disk. This technique could be used simply to avoid having to insert and remove disks -- or it could be used for piracy (say, by renting a game, putting the software on the hard drive and returning the game). Until passage of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act in 1998, the mere sale of a modified chip would not have appeared illegal. That law, however, prohibits the sale of devices that are primarily meant to circumvent copyright protection. Companies and technologists will fight over the exact legal meaning of those provisions for years. For now, however, the software industry is relying on them. ''Our view over all on modchips is that they are illegal infringing devices, that where we find people engaged in the widespread manufacturing and distribution of them, we and our members, individually and collectively, are committed to doing what we can to shut down their manufacturing and go after the distributors,'' said Doug Lowenstein, president of the Interactive Digital Software Association. Some advocates, however, say that while software piracy is illegal and morally offensive, the mere act of modifying hardware should not be illegal. ''The most important dimension of this debate from our view is that people should have the right to tinker with the stuff that they own,'' said Fred von Lohmann, senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a civil-liberties group in San Francisco. ''Others will say that this is about piracy and all that, but they forget that the principle of tinkering with the stuff that you own was the principle on which the entire personal computer industry was founded,'' he added. ''This is basic business and basic science in the technology world and we think that this right to tinker, this freedom to tinker, remains legally protected.'' For now, however, the federal government seems to agree with Mr. Lowenstein. Last December, David M. Rocci, a 22-year-old from Blacksburg, Va., pleaded guilty to a federal charge of conspiring to import, market and sell modchips for the Xbox. In April, he was sentenced to five months in prison and five months of home detention. Simply from the standpoint of accessibility, the PlayStation 2 would seem to be a more likely candidate for hacking. IDG, the technology research firm, estimates that at the end of last year, 38.1 million PlayStation 2 units were in use in Europe, North America and Japan combined, compared with 6.7 million Xbox units in those regions. In one sense, however, the hacking scene for PlayStation 2 is less developed than the one for Xbox because there is less appetite for it. Sony sells an official conversion kit for the PlayStation 2 that includes a hard drive and allows that system to run the Linux operating system, which in turn allows the system to run MP3's, movies, spreadsheets or any other program or data that works under Linux. It is relatively easy for Sony to embrace Linux because Sony, unlike Microsoft, is not in the operating system business. The PlayStation 2 hacking community seems focused on developing chips that allow PlayStation 2 units to run illegal copies of games and games meant for far-flung parts of the world. (For marketing reasons, many PlayStation 2 games include regional coding, much as DVD's do.) In 2001, Sony sued an Australian for selling modchips that allowed Australian PlayStation 2 units to play games from other parts of the world. After the Australian government argued on the man's behalf, however, the Federal Court of Australia last July ruled mostly against Sony. Mr. von Lohmann said that Microsoft had not been particularly aggressive in combating Xbox hackers but that Sony had actively fought them. A Sony spokeswoman did not respond this week to requests for comment about the company's approach to hackers. For its part, Microsoft, through its public relations agency, indicated that it believed Xbox hackers were a relatively small band. ''Aside from a set of hobbyists,'' it said, ''the vast majority of Xbox owners are not focused on this niche.'' But those who are appear quite focused indeed. By e-mail, Mr. Steil, the German leader of the Xbox Linux project, declared: ''In very simple words: The Xbox is cheaper than a PC. The Xbox is a lot smaller than a PC. The Xbox looks better (next to a TV set). The Xbox is more silent. Therefore it's an ideal Linux computer in the living room.'' That was probably not the vision Mr. Gates had in mind."

                "WHEN the dust finally settled on the 2006 holiday buying season, American consumers — who braved long lines, cold weather and possibly a few kicks to the shins — had spent $3.7 billion on new video-game consoles and software. And while the more than two million youngsters (and not-so-youngsters) who discovered a next-generation gaming system under the Christmas tree — a Microsoft Xbox 360, a Sony PlayStation 3 or a Nintendo Wii — represent a substantial user base for these platforms, they mean even more to the entertainment industry as a whole. To the makers of these video-game systems and to a growing number of film and television studios, they represent a significant new audience for full-length movies and television shows that can be downloaded directly to gaming consoles. In late November Microsoft began expanding the library on its Xbox Live network, a broadband service available by subscription to Xbox 360 owners. In addition to the video-game trailers and playable demonstrations that the network has traditionally offered, you can now find an eclectically selected collection of films and television shows offered for downloading to a console’s hard drive: for a few dollars you can view “Mission: Impossible III” or “Chinatown” or the episode of “Chappelle’s Show” with the blind white supremacist, on your television, just as if you were watching a DVD or a video-on-demand channel.  For gamers with top-shelf home-theater setups, Xbox Live also offers content in high definition: download the HD version of the “Star Trek” episode “Mirror, Mirror,” in which the Enterprise crew is accidentally beamed into a malevolent alternate reality, and you can practically count each strand of hair in evil Mr. Spock’s goatee. This month XBox Live will offer a new view of the corpulent form of Eric Cartman when it becomes the first outlet ever to offer an episode of “South Park” in high definition. While Microsoft acknowledges that most consumers are buying Xbox 360s primarily, if not solely, to play video games, the company also sees an opportunity to use film and television content to draw an audience that doesn’t fit the stereotypical gamer profile.  “The original Xbox was probably the domain of that testosterone-fueled male in the household, and while we love him to death, we also want his little brother and sister and mom and dad and their friends to be able to enjoy it,” said Peter Moore, corporate vice president of Microsoft’s interactive entertainment business division.  To that end Microsoft spent several months negotiating with Hollywood studios and television networks, including Warner Brothers, Paramount, CBS and MTV, to secure a broad variety of programming before rolling out the expanded Xbox Live service.  Although more than 4.5 million Xbox 360s have been sold, and some 60 percent of owners are connected to Xbox Live, the network’s audience will not make broadcast television or movie theaters obsolete any time soon. Yet the kind of content most abundantly available on the network — goofy comedies like “Nacho Libre” and “Zoolander,” clips of Nascar races and adventure films like “Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior” — clearly indicates whom Microsoft expects to make the most use of it: men in their 20s and 30s with enough disposable income to buy lots of video games.  “This guy is typically not going to the movies, and more often than not he’s not watching television, he’s playing games in the living room,” Mr. Moore said. “He’s a difficult person to get to in the first place.”  It is Xbox Live’s potential to deliver such a narrowly defined and increasingly difficult-to-reach demographic that makes it so enticing to the entertainment industry. “This is, to a large extent, an entirely new audience for us,” said Steve Beeks, the president of Lionsgate, an independent studio whose library includes horror movies like “The Descent” and the “Saw” franchise and which recently announced it would make its films available for download on Xbox Live. “These are active buyers of games, but we don’t believe they’ve been active buyers of movies. We’re turning them into consumers of films.”  For television networks whose programming appears on the service, Xbox Live offers the additional benefit of a precise metric to determine how many gamers are downloading their shows and how many are then seeking out these shows on broadcast television.  “We’re gauging how different clips translate into what kind of pickup in viewership we get and what kind of buzz we’re getting on the blogs,” said Dennis Quinn, Turner Broadcasting’s executive vice president for business development. “If they’re watching a six-minute clip of ‘Robot Chicken,’ is that translating into a greater sampling of the network show? If we see older shows like ‘Harvey Birdman’ picking up again, what does that mean for people who produce the content?” At least one of Microsoft’s competitors is also preparing to enter this digital arena. Sony’s PlayStation 3, which comes with the ability to play high-definition Blu-ray DVDs, also allows gamers to connect to Sony’s own broadband network. Right now that network doesn’t offer much more than video-game demos and movie trailers, but that will soon change.  “As long as you’re downloading a trailer, what’s to stop us from offering the entire program, whether it’s a movie or a TV show?” said Peter Dille, the senior vice president for marketing for Sony Computer Entertainment America. “Being part of Sony Corporation, with a film entertainment company as a sister company and a music company at arm’s length, the world is our oyster in many respects.” For the moment Nintendo has no immediate plans to make film and television programming available for its Wii game console, which also lets gamers connect to an Internet-based network of content channels. But the company did not rule out the possibility.  “There’s a lot of plans we have for the channels,” said Perrin Kaplan, Nintendo’s vice president for marketing. “And there are ways that they could be used that we haven’t yet really conceived of.” Though Microsoft is the only gaming company to provide a substantial content library (roughly 100 movies and several hundred television episodes so far), some gamers feel the offerings are too limited to encourage them to use the feature regularly.  “Until you feel like it’s a pretty comprehensive list where you can look up just about anything, it’s not a service that I think most people will use,” said Dan Hsu, editor in chief of Electronic Gaming Monthly magazine. “You can just go, ‘Well, maybe I’ll check the iTunes music store or nbc.com and see if they have the shows that I want.’ ”  Other industry executives say the current push to provide entertainment content has more to do with satisfying console manufacturers’ needs than with fulfilling gamers’ demands.  “For this round of consoles it makes total sense that they have to focus on entertainment,” said Ricardo Sanchez, an executive at GameTap, a service that lets subscribers play console and arcade games on their personal computers. “For Sony I’ve got to believe the PS3 is as much about establishing Blu-ray as it is about selling games. On the Microsoft side they’re betting so much on Xbox Live that they’ll do practically anything to drive awareness and interest in it.”  At the same time, Mr. Sanchez said, “I don’t see them spending a lot of effort, beyond just aggregating content you can get elsewhere.”  Most gamers understand that in exchange for the ability to watch “South Park” reruns on demand, they are giving the console makers something: a valuable piece of real estate in their home-theater cabinets that a DVD player or stereo receiver might otherwise occupy. That bargain is especially precious for Microsoft, which is still better known as a monolithic software company than a trusted manufacturer of home electronics.  “This is following years of Bill Gates wanting to pursue something around a set-top box,” said Josh Larson, the director of the video-game Web site GameSpot.com. “It’s kind of a Trojan horse into the living room.” But as media ploys go, Mr. Larson would rather download his movies from Xbox Live than from PC-based services like Movielink or Amazon.com’s Unbox. “Is it more likely for a gamer that you’re going to download from iTunes and hook your PC up to your TV set?” he asked. “Or a couple button-pushes and you’re watching it in a way that you’re used to watching that content? I think that’s pretty powerful.” Despite the enduring perception that his company is seeking to conquer the universe, Mr. Moore said Microsoft was looking only to provide an audience of savvy, affluent media consumers with the kind of products they want in the way they’ve grown accustomed to consuming them. “In my case,” he said, “I very rarely watch live television anymore. Shows like ‘Lost,’ I’ll wait for the DVD, thank you, rather than have to see it chopped up into five-minute increments with four minutes of commercials. In today’s world we don’t have appointment viewing anymore.” More recently, Mr. Moore said, he was looking to catch up on some recent episodes of “CSI” — in high-definition, preferably — and sure enough, the only place he could find them was on Xbox Live. “I live in Seattle,” he explained, “and I have DirecTV. They don’t put the local networks on in high-def.”"

                "Owners of Microsoft's Xbox 360 game console will soon be able to watch science fiction epics as well as play them. Microsoft said last night that it would offer movies and episodes of television shows for downloading through its Xbox Live online service in the United States, starting Nov. 22. With the new offerings, Microsoft is joining cable giants and Internet start-ups on the long list of companies hoping to profit from video downloading. But Internet-based services have had trouble getting traction because it can be complex to send a downloaded film to a television screen and frustrating to watch it on the small screen of a computer. Owners of the Xbox have already connected it to a TV and, in most cases, the Internet. \"What makes this big is that there's no PC in the middle,\" said Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group. Microsoft has negotiated the rights to rent or sell more than 1,000 hours of material from CBS, MTV Networks, Paramount, Warner Brothers and Turner Broadcasting, along with the martial arts show \"Ultimate Fighting Championship.\" Some programs will be available in high-definition video. The video store will work much like that of Apple Computer, with some important differences. While users will be able to keep television shows, movies can be rented for only a limited period. The videos will not be playable on other devices and cannot be burned onto DVDs, but the online service will keep track of purchases so that users can log in to watch their videos on a friend's Xbox. Peter Moore, Microsoft's corporate vice president for interactive entertainment, said that the price of standard-definition videos would be comparable to what competitors charged. Apple's iTunes charges $1.99 for an episode of a television program. High-definition content will cost more, Mr. Moore said, because of the costs involved in storing it and making it available for downloading. Purchases will be made with points that users can buy with a credit card or a gift certificate, or win in contests. Mr. Moore said the service was partly intended to make the Xbox more versatile and therefore more attractive. \"Direct revenue from this over the long term could be important,\" Mr. Moore said. \"But this is also another reason to buy an Xbox 360.\" New game consoles from Sony and Nintendo are due out this month, a year after the Xbox 360 went on sale, so extra features could help Microsoft keep up in the marketplace. Nintendo is concentrating on game play, but Sony says it also has other content in mind. \"We haven't announced any content besides games,\" said Dave Karraker, a spokesman for Sony Computer Entertainment America, \"but all the executives have said that downloading other entertainment content is something the PlayStation 3 is capable of doing.\" Judging by the initial offerings, Xbox Live will be something of a cyberspace version of the Spike Channel, MTV Networks' cable channel aimed at young men. It will sell episodes of \"Star Trek,\" remastered in high definition, as well as the \"C.S.I.\" shows, some music videos and cartoons from the Cartoon Network's \"Adult Swim.\" \"The interesting thing is that we're delivering the 18-to-34-year-olds who aren't watching TV,\" Mr. Moore said. Microsoft has sold more than two million Xbox 360 consoles in the United States, according to the NPD Group, a market research firm. Most of those who buy the machines sign up for the Xbox Live service, which requires broadband Internet access and allows users to compete against each other. Since the introduction of the Xbox 360 last year, the service has also sold simple video games and other material. This year, Microsoft started to hint at its ambitions for the Xbox Live service when it purchased a company that places advertising in video games and made an ad deal with Cadillac. In the last few years, Microsoft has been pushing the idea of Media Center PCs, which are meant to sit in the living room and supply music and video to the stereo and the television set. But the concept has not caught on, in part because of the complexity of setting up and using these systems. Mr. Enderle said that apart from simplicity, another feature that would set the XBox Live service apart is that it will be the first service to sell downloadable movies in high definition, at a resolution similar to or better than a DVD. Until now, he said, most studios have been reluctant to allow cable channels to show movies in high definition for fear of piracy, but that would be less of a threat on XBox Live. Early next year, Apple plans to introduce a product that, on a preliminary basis, it is calling iTV and that is intended to be a bridge between the computer and the television set. But Microsoft will go into the video business with a different business model. Apple, most analysts maintain, does not make much money selling iTunes content, but makes up for that by selling more iPods, which are extremely profitable. Microsoft, which analysts say loses money on each Xbox 360 it sells, expects to make up for that by selling games -- and now video. \"This is a razors-and-blades business,\" Mr. Moore said. \"I've taken the hit on the razor. And the ability of Microsoft to offer more blades gives consumers more choice and drives more revenue.\" The video downloads, especially those in high definition, will take up a lot of space. Microsoft says a one-hour television program in high definition will take up about 2 gigabytes of the console's standard 20-gigabyte hard drive. Microsoft says the Xbox will play both movies and TV shows as they are being downloaded, although with larger files there will be a delay before playback starts, in contrast to the video-on-demand services offered by cable companies. High-definition movies will take an especially long while, depending on the speed of the Internet connection. Editors' Note: November 10, 2006, Friday An article in Business Day on Tuesday described a decision by Microsoft to offer movies and episodes of television shows for downloading through its Xbox Live online service in the United States. The article quoted Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group, discussing the features that set Xbox Live service apart and its position in the market. But the article did not note that Mr. Enderle had Microsoft as a client, a fact later pointed out by a reader. Mr. Enderle does consulting work for several of Microsoft's product groups, though not for the one developing the Xbox; still, had The Times known of Mr. Enderle's work for Microsoft, it would not have sought out his opinion on the product."

                "TOKYO — Microsoft is expected to slash the price of its Xbox 360 game console in Japan by about 30 percent, below the price of Nintendo's Wii and Sony's PlayStation 3 as it tries to increase its market share, a newspaper reported Monday. Demand for the Xbox 360 has been tepid in Japan, mainly due to a lack of popular games. In contrast, the market-leading Wii is thriving on a range of innovative software, prompting Nintendo to raise its earning forecast Friday. Hiroshi Kamide, a KBC Securities analyst, said a price cut alone is unlikely to trigger a jump in demand for the Xbox 360 and Microsoft needs to focus more on producing attractive software. \"Popular software is now serving as a tail wind to Xbox sales,\" he said. \"Even if they slash the console price, that would not directly boost sales unless they release more good software.\" Robust demand for Namco Bandai's \"Tales of Vesperia\" role-playing game helped Xbox 360's Japanese sales in the week ended Aug. 10. beat the PlayStation 3 for the first time. Microsoft will lower the price of the Xbox 360 Arcade model by ¥8,000 to ¥19,800, or about $180, the Nikkei business daily said. The Arcade does not come equipped with a hard drive and is the least expensive of the three Xbox 360 models. The company has already cut the price in the United States, Europe and four Asian markets as it tries to grab a larger chunk of the $57 billion game industry. The new price will make that model cheaper than Nintendo's Wii, which sells for about ¥25,000 yen, and the PlayStation 3, which sells for ¥39,800. The Wii's success has been attributed to inventive titles like the \"Wii Fit\" exercise game, its low price and its easy-to-learn motion-sensing controller. Microsoft will also reduce the price of two more expensive models with hard drives by ¥5,000 to ¥8,000, the paper said. Kazumi Ishiyama, a Microsoft Xbox spokeswoman in Japan, declined to comment on the Nikkei report. The company is scheduled to hold a briefing on the Xbox 360 in the Japanese market Monday afternoon. In Europe, the Xbox 360 Arcade model already costs less than the Wii. The Xbox 360 has lagged its Japanese rivals on their home turf, with 684,695 units sold so far in Japan against Wii's 6.67 million and PlayStation 3's 2.32 million, according to the game magazine publisher Enterbrain. The Xbox 360 was introduced about a year before its rivals."

                "AFTER a 31-year-old Manhattan financial executive received Microsoft's Xbox video game system as a gift in January, he walked to a store and bought a half-dozen game titles. The video game industry would have been pleased to hear it. After he played those games a few times against computer-controlled opponents, he got a bit bored and signed up for Microsoft's Xbox Live service, which enabled him to play against other people online. The video game industry, again, would have been pleased. After a few months on the Xbox Live network, in May, he got a bit bored again. This time, however, he opened his Xbox and soldered in a chip that allowed him to change the console's basic computer code and bypass its internal security technology. After installing a new hard drive, he transferred about 3,000 MP3 music files to the system and downloaded illegal copies of 3,500 old-time arcade games. Then he installed the Linux operating system, which allowed him to use the box essentially as a personal computer. Needless to say, the video game industry would not have been pleased. When Microsoft released the Xbox in November 2001, it was heralded as far more than a game machine. Even as the Xbox took aim at Sony's PlayStation 2 game empire, the console was meant to lead Microsoft's broader invasion of the living room. Incorporating a hard drive, which made it more readily adaptable than other consoles, the Xbox had the potential to be a digital-entertainment nerve center. Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, said at the time, ''We're going to put new software that runs on Xbox that, both in the gaming dimension and other dimensions, will amaze people with the power that's in this box.'' That is happening, but not necessarily as Microsoft planned. All sorts of new software is indeed running on Xbox consoles these days, and they are in fact becoming home-entertainment hubs, but it is not Microsoft doing the amazing. Rather, an online confederacy apparently numbering in the thousands -- including accomplished hackers of varied motives and everyday technophiles like the Manhattan financial executive (who shared his experience on the condition of anonymity) -- is taking the lead. Those involved often call their efforts ''unleashing'' or ''unshackling'' -- freeing the Xbox to express its inner PC. Technology industry executives, however, often call such activity a bald attempt to hijack the Xbox illegally. It is a battle that involves many of the ethical and legal issues facing the technology and media industries at this digital moment. What rights do consumers have to tinker with products they own? How far should companies go to protect their intellectual property? What happens when the desires of consumers conflict with the business models of companies they patronize? Who gets to decide just what a particular product may be used for? The Xbox is a particularly attractive target for hackers because while it is essentially a standard PC modified to do only a few things, like play Xbox games, it is much cheaper than a PC. It is like an economy car modified to follow only a few roads -- but one potentially as powerful as a far more expensive model. In the Xbox, that power comes in the form of a 733-megahertz Intel processor, comparable to a midrange personal computer, and sophisticated graphics and audio systems. Its limited operating system, based on a version of Windows, can be used by a programmer to run simple software like a music player -- or the machine can run a new operating system altogether, namely Linux. ''The reality is that if you could bypass Microsoft's operating system you would end up with a fairly powerful computer for less than $200,'' the Manhattan financial executive said. In fact, Microsoft lowered the price for Xbox to $179.99 in May. In a sense, Xbox hackers are exploiting Microsoft's business model, which is to sell Xbox hardware at a loss (to build penetration of the system) and make the money back on royalties from the sale of Xbox software. A PC manufacturer like Dell, meanwhile, has to recoup its costs and generate a profit from the initial sale. So someone who buys the Xbox hardware, modifies it into a general-purpose computer and does not buy Xbox games potentially undermines not only Microsoft but also the personal computer industry. But that is not how some Xbox hackers think about it. ''Especially in Europe, computers are more expensive than they are here, and the Xbox is the cheapest computer you can get,'' Andrew Huang, author of a new book called ''Hacking the Xbox: An Introduction to Reverse Engineering,'' said in a telephone interview. ''Basically,'' he added by e-mail, ''once you have Linux, you have everything.'' It is unclear just how many Xbox hackers there are. Officials of the Interactive Digital Software Association, a trade group of video game publishers, said that Xbox hacking appeared more prevalent in parts of Asia than in North America. Michael Steil, a 24-year-old German who is project leader of a group that calls itself the Xbox Linux Project, said by e-mail that a full version of Linux software for the Xbox had been downloaded more than 220,000 times. Whatever the numbers, Microsoft does not appear eager to discuss Xbox hacking. In recent weeks, a Microsoft public relations representative repeatedly declined to make any company executives available to discuss the matter. Instead, the company issued a statement through a public relations firm that said in part: ''Microsoft is a company passionate about innovation and creativity. We are also very committed to respect for others' intellectual property and we request the same respect applied to our innovations.'' The statement made no reference to the potential use of hacked Xbox consoles as personal computers, saying Microsoft's ''primary concern'' was with the sale of modified chips for the boxes ''that enable game counterfeiting.'' And that is the area that most clearly raises legal issues. Although there are several methods, hacking an Xbox typically involves obtaining a special chip called a modchip, available on the Internet, and soldering it into the machine. (For those who find the process daunting, there are also vendors on the Internet who sell ''pre-modded'' Xbox units.) Modchips, of which there are several varieties, allow users to load new versions of the basic computer code, known as the BIOS, that tells the machine how to operate. A hacked BIOS generally incorporates modified versions of copyrighted Microsoft code and so is generally illegal. The main Web sites that deal with Xbox hacking do not include links to hacked BIOS, and hackers generally find their forbidden fruit in Internet chat rooms. Once the modchip is installed and the BIOS modified, the console can do a number of things it cannot do ''out of the box.'' Xbox games normally must be run from an optical disk, and a hacked Xbox can ''back up'' a game to the unit's hard drive and run the game without the disk. This technique could be used simply to avoid having to insert and remove disks -- or it could be used for piracy (say, by renting a game, putting the software on the hard drive and returning the game). Until passage of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act in 1998, the mere sale of a modified chip would not have appeared illegal. That law, however, prohibits the sale of devices that are primarily meant to circumvent copyright protection. Companies and technologists will fight over the exact legal meaning of those provisions for years. For now, however, the software industry is relying on them. ''Our view over all on modchips is that they are illegal infringing devices, that where we find people engaged in the widespread manufacturing and distribution of them, we and our members, individually and collectively, are committed to doing what we can to shut down their manufacturing and go after the distributors,'' said Doug Lowenstein, president of the Interactive Digital Software Association. Some advocates, however, say that while software piracy is illegal and morally offensive, the mere act of modifying hardware should not be illegal. ''The most important dimension of this debate from our view is that people should have the right to tinker with the stuff that they own,'' said Fred von Lohmann, senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a civil-liberties group in San Francisco. ''Others will say that this is about piracy and all that, but they forget that the principle of tinkering with the stuff that you own was the principle on which the entire personal computer industry was founded,'' he added. ''This is basic business and basic science in the technology world and we think that this right to tinker, this freedom to tinker, remains legally protected.'' For now, however, the federal government seems to agree with Mr. Lowenstein. Last December, David M. Rocci, a 22-year-old from Blacksburg, Va., pleaded guilty to a federal charge of conspiring to import, market and sell modchips for the Xbox. In April, he was sentenced to five months in prison and five months of home detention. Simply from the standpoint of accessibility, the PlayStation 2 would seem to be a more likely candidate for hacking. IDG, the technology research firm, estimates that at the end of last year, 38.1 million PlayStation 2 units were in use in Europe, North America and Japan combined, compared with 6.7 million Xbox units in those regions. In one sense, however, the hacking scene for PlayStation 2 is less developed than the one for Xbox because there is less appetite for it. Sony sells an official conversion kit for the PlayStation 2 that includes a hard drive and allows that system to run the Linux operating system, which in turn allows the system to run MP3's, movies, spreadsheets or any other program or data that works under Linux. It is relatively easy for Sony to embrace Linux because Sony, unlike Microsoft, is not in the operating system business. The PlayStation 2 hacking community seems focused on developing chips that allow PlayStation 2 units to run illegal copies of games and games meant for far-flung parts of the world. (For marketing reasons, many PlayStation 2 games include regional coding, much as DVD's do.) In 2001, Sony sued an Australian for selling modchips that allowed Australian PlayStation 2 units to play games from other parts of the world. After the Australian government argued on the man's behalf, however, the Federal Court of Australia last July ruled mostly against Sony. Mr. von Lohmann said that Microsoft had not been particularly aggressive in combating Xbox hackers but that Sony had actively fought them. A Sony spokeswoman did not respond this week to requests for comment about the company's approach to hackers. For its part, Microsoft, through its public relations agency, indicated that it believed Xbox hackers were a relatively small band. ''Aside from a set of hobbyists,'' it said, ''the vast majority of Xbox owners are not focused on this niche.'' But those who are appear quite focused indeed. By e-mail, Mr. Steil, the German leader of the Xbox Linux project, declared: ''In very simple words: The Xbox is cheaper than a PC. The Xbox is a lot smaller than a PC. The Xbox looks better (next to a TV set). The Xbox is more silent. Therefore it's an ideal Linux computer in the living room.'' That was probably not the vision Mr. Gates had in mind."

                "Users of Microsoft’s popular Xbox Kinect gaming console will soon be able to use voice and motion commands to interact with advertisements while they are playing their favorite game or watching a video. On Tuesday, Microsoft is set to announce a new suite of advertising tools, called NUads, short for natural user-interface ads, that will let users interact with advertising on the console dashboard or embedded in games and other video content. The ads use the same voice and motion control developed for the company’s Kinect game console, which it introduced in time for the 2010 holiday season.  The new ads are intended to help advertisers keep the attention of Xbox users in a way that traditional television advertising does not.  “When you have highly interactive people and a passive medium, they are interacting with their phone or their laptop while watching TV,” said Mark Kroese, the general manager of the advertising business group at Microsoft. The new ads, Mr. Kroese said, “create a natural way for the user to engage with the TV.”  At least one advertising agency seems to agree.  “The new ad units really epitomized the level of engagement that everyone is working towards,” said John M. Lisko, the executive communications director of Saatchi & Saatchi Los Angeles, part of the Publicis Groupe. Mr. Lisko said the agency had successfully advertised on the Xbox console in the past and was “absolutely considering” the new capabilities. “You can text, you can tweet, you can vote,” he said. “That’s phenomenal.”  Using voice commands, gamers will be able to send messages about an ad to a social networking site like Twitter by saying “Xbox Tweet.” Advertisers who want to send more information about a product or promotion associated with a campaign can prompt Xbox users to say “Xbox More,” which will send users an e-mail with the information they wanted.  For advertising tied to events like television shows, advertisers can prompt a user to say “Xbox Schedule” and the system will send a text message reminder to the user’s mobile phone. Similarly, advertisers can prompt users to say “Xbox Near Me” and a map to the nearest retailer will be sent to their mobile phone. Finally, advertisers can prompt users to vote on a topic by asking the user to wave their hand in front of the console and select their favorite pizza topping, superhero or clothing brand.  The new advertising options will be presented on Tuesday to advertisers at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, an annual conference for advertisers and marketers. Consumers will begin to see the new features in the spring of 2012.  The new ads will be simple for marketers to deploy since they can use the same commercials they would use on television.  “What we’re seeing now is a technology environment where marketers can deliver more sophisticated ads and they don’t have some of the hurdles that in-game marketers and in-game publishers had,” said Paul Verna, a senior analyst at eMarketer. “It’s a level of interactivity that suggests more possibilities than we’ve seen up until now.” "

                "The daughter of a Brazilian Catholic mother and a Palestinian Muslim father, Fatima Shama, 39, grew up in the Bronx, attending Roman Catholic school during the week, Muslim “Sunday school” on Saturdays and church on Sundays. She speaks six languages, which comes in handy for her job as the commissioner of the Mayor’s Office of Immigrant Affairs, a position she has held since 2009. (Recently, her office reached out to immigrant communities affected by Hurricane Sandy to help them navigate government resources and aid.) She lives in Turtle Bay in Manhattan with her husband, Ziad Mansouri, 42, who works at JPMorgan Chase, and their three sons, Samir, 8; Ibrahim, 5; and Omar, 2. She and her husband are raising them as Muslims, with a generous dose of other religious traditions. WAKE-UP CALL My kids tend to wake me up — that’s about 6:30, 7 o’clock. Coffee is absolutely essential. It’s almost the first thing I do. Then we get the Sunday Times. My youngest son loves to be the person to get it for me. INTERNATIONAL BREAKFAST It could be me deciding to make Belgian waffles or pancakes, or it’s possible I’ll make — my kids love an Arabic breakfast food called lebni — basically, strained yogurt, and you eat it with pita bread. And they love an Arabic string cheese and another kind of cheese common to the region called haloumi, a must to every breakfast table in our house OUTSIDE VOICES Sundays are absolutely about family and spending time with our kids. From 11 to 2 is our outside time. We might go ice skating at Wollman Rink, or the Central Park Zoo; we are there a lot and we love it. I think that the kids would probably say the Museum of Natural History is their favorite, just ‘cause of what we get to see. It’s everything from butterflies and frogs and lizards to the dinosaurs or the elephants. And they can be loud and we don’t have to apologize to anybody. Sometimes we’ll do excursions out of the city, or there might be a children’s birthday party or two, given our kids’ social lives. PARADER IN CHIEF If it’s summertime, there’s likely a parade that I might march in or a community event I might stop by. Of course, during the hurricane, every Sunday we were out in the community. But if it’s summertime, rest assured there’s a parade in my future. BOYS’ TIME Our kids are only allowed to play their electronics on the weekends. Our kids got an Xbox for Christmas — I grew up in a dual home, so my kids have the pleasure of learning about their own faith, but also being able to celebrate the faith of my siblings and mother. The Xbox Kinect Dance Central game, I will tell you that is hysterical. I actually love the fact that this Kinect thing helps them jump around. And Sunday football is a big deal. We’re a Giants home, but my sons love the Tampa Bay Buccaneers — their mascot is a pirate, so we think that’s how it started. My oldest son can tell you anything about football. SHOPPING, COOKING I try to cook for the week or make some Sunday dinner for us, so I might run to the supermarket. I love to cook with my kids. My middle son loves to make a Brazilian cheese bread, so we make that a lot. We make black beans and rice, there’s always a pasta night — I do make, actually, a lot of Arabic food. WINDING DOWN Then it’s dinner, bath time and we do reading every night. Our kids are in bed by about 8:30. And it’s my date with “Downton Abbey.” Lady Grantham, the grandmother, I just love her absolutely dry sarcasm and her love of the monarchy and all things traditional. And I try to clean out my e-mail before Monday morning, do what I can do to make life better before Monday morning. FINISHING UP This is actually a very true thing: I basically don’t go to sleep until I finish the paper so I can put it out into the recycling bin. Otherwise it becomes a pile. I actually try to finish all of my Sunday paper and I actually read the paper — Sunday in particular — minus a couple sections, cover to cover. I love holding the paper, but I love the ads. I like to look at the jewelry ads. Even though I could never buy any of it."

                "NEW YORK — Reaching out to millions of aspiring game developers around the world, Microsoft is holding a contest that will award $10,000 and the opportunity to entice millions of viewers to the next great digital diversion for the company's Xbox 360. In addition to the game console's snazzy graphics, the Xbox Live online service has been the most important component of the Xbox 360's success since its debut in 2005. And perhaps the most popular aspect of Xbox Live has been the service's arcade component, which allows users to download and play smaller, relatively simple games like \"Uno\" and \"Geometry Wars\" that usually cost less than $10. (By contrast, top-end games can sell in stores for around $60.) The popularity of Xbox Live Arcade has in turn attracted the attention of game developers looking to create the next \"Tetris\" or \"Minesweeper.\" Late last year, Microsoft introduced a suite of software tools for making so- called casual games called XNA. So at a convention of game makers Monday in San Francisco, Microsoft was to announce a contest that will award a cash prize and a potential slot on Xbox Live Arcade to the best game created with XNA tools. The company intends to announce the winner of the \"Dream-Build-Play\" contest in August. \"This competition highlights the power of XNA and the popularity of the Xbox Live Arcade service, with its millions of users,\" Aaron Greenberg, Microsoft's group product manager for the Xbox 360 and Xbox Live, said by phone. To help increase the popularity of casual games, Microsoft is also introducing a 512-megabyte portable storage device for the Xbox 360. The previous portable storage unit contained only 64 megabytes of data, and so Xbox Live Arcade games had been limited to an official size of 50 megabytes. With the new unit, Microsoft will also raise the official size limit on Xbox Live Arcade games to 150 megabytes, allowing enhanced graphics, sound and artificial intelligence."

                "LOS ANGELES — In what may be one of the costliest consumer warranty repairs in history, Microsoft announced on Thursday that it would spend up to $1.15 billion to repair failing Xbox 360 game machine consoles. While the company would not say how many units were failing, Robbie Bach, president of Microsoft's entertainment and devices division, said that there have been an \"unacceptable high number of repairs.\" The majority of Xbox 360 owners, he said, have not experienced hardware failure. Company officials said that Microsoft had sold 11.6 million Xbox 360 units by the end of June, shy of the 12 million units the company had predicted. The Xbox 360, which first went of sale in November 2005, is currently the best-selling game machine in the United States, according to NPD, a market research firm. The size of the anticipated repair bill suggests that a third to as many as half of the machines are flawed. Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington State, said it would take a charge of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion against earnings in the quarter ended June 30. Consumers know they have a problem if three red flashing lights appear on the console. Gamers on online forums have been referring to the event as \"the Red Ring of Death\" because the machine then shuts down. The company declined to explain the nature of the failure, but said that it was not caused by a single problem in the console, which it said contained 1,700 components and 500 million transistors. The company also said there were no health or safety concerns involved. The problem began to appear over the last three to four months, Bach said, after \"significant usage\" of the consoles. He said the company has taken steps to correct the problem in new devices. Microsoft said it would extend the warranty of the game console to three years to customers worldwide. Previously, products sold in the United States were covered by a one-year warranty, while Xbox 360 units sold in Europe had a two-year warranty. In addition, customers who have had their consoles repaired because of the \"three flashing lights\" problem will be reimbursed for the cost of the repairs. Microsoft has succeeded in establishing the Xbox brand against the better known Sony PlayStation and other game machines. The Xbox and its successor, the Xbox 360, was the software maker's first major foray into hardware. Although sales are small relative to the rest of Microsoft's revenue, the Xbox has been an important venture for the company and was viewed by many analysts as Microsoft's attempt to compete with the likes of Sony and Apple for control of electronics and entertainment within homes. The device can be used to access the Internet and view movies. Microsoft said its entertainment and devices division reported an operating loss of $315 million on $929 million in revenue for the three-month period that ended in March, and analysts have estimated that the company lost about $6 billion getting a foothold in the game machine industry. A new Xbox 360 with a 20-gigabyte hard drive sells for about $400, but other versions cost about $300. The announcement comes on the eve of the E3 Media and Business Summit, the video-game industry's major trade show, to be held next week in Los Angeles. \"This is bound to affect discussions between Microsoft and its developers and retailers,\" said Richard Doherty, a partner in the research company Envisioneering Group."

                "Editors’ Note Appended Owners of Microsoft’s Xbox 360 game console will soon be able to watch science fiction epics as well as play them.  Microsoft said last night that it would offer movies and episodes of television shows for downloading through its Xbox Live online service in the United States, starting Nov. 22.  With the new offerings, Microsoft is joining cable giants and Internet start-ups on the long list of companies hoping to profit from video downloading. But Internet-based services have had trouble getting traction because it can be complex to send a downloaded film to a television screen and frustrating to watch it on the small screen of a computer. Owners of the Xbox have already connected it to a TV and, in most cases, the Internet. “What makes this big is that there’s no PC in the middle,” said Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group. Microsoft has negotiated the rights to rent or sell more than 1,000 hours of material from CBS, MTV Networks, Paramount, Warner Brothers and Turner Broadcasting, along with the martial arts show “Ultimate Fighting Championship.” Some programs will be available in high-definition video. The video store will work much like that of Apple Computer, with some important differences. While users will be able to keep television shows, movies can be rented for only a limited period. The videos will not be playable on other devices and cannot be burned onto DVDs, but the online service will keep track of purchases so that users can log in to watch their videos on a friend’s Xbox.  Peter Moore, Microsoft’s corporate vice president for interactive entertainment, said that the price of standard-definition videos would be comparable to what competitors charged. Apple’s iTunes charges $1.99 for an episode of a television program.  High-definition content will cost more, Mr. Moore said, because of the costs involved in storing it and making it available for downloading. Purchases will be made with points that users can buy with a credit card or a gift certificate, or win in contests.  Mr. Moore said the service was partly intended to make the Xbox more versatile and therefore more attractive. “Direct revenue from this over the long term could be important,” Mr. Moore said. “But this is also another reason to buy an Xbox 360.”  New game consoles from Sony and Nintendo are due out this month, a year after the Xbox 360 went on sale, so extra features could help Microsoft keep up in the marketplace. Nintendo is concentrating on game play, but Sony says it also has other content in mind.  “We haven’t announced any content besides games,” said Dave Karraker, a spokesman for Sony Computer Entertainment America, “but all the executives have said that downloading other entertainment content is something the PlayStation 3 is capable of doing.” Judging by the initial offerings, Xbox Live will be something of a cyberspace version of the Spike Channel, MTV Networks’ cable channel aimed at young men. It will sell episodes of “Star Trek,” remastered in high definition, as well as the “C.S.I.” shows, some music videos and cartoons from the Cartoon Network’s “Adult Swim.”  “The interesting thing is that we’re delivering the 18-to-34-year-olds who aren’t watching TV,” Mr. Moore said. Microsoft has sold more than two million Xbox 360 consoles in the United States, according to the NPD Group, a market research firm. Most of those who buy the machines sign up for the Xbox Live service, which requires broadband Internet access and allows users to compete against each other.  Since the introduction of the Xbox 360 last year, the service has also sold simple video games and other material. This year, Microsoft started to hint at its ambitions for the Xbox Live service when it purchased a company that places advertising in video games and made an ad deal with Cadillac.  In the last few years, Microsoft has been pushing the idea of Media Center PCs, which are meant to sit in the living room and supply music and video to the stereo and the television set. But the concept has not caught on, in part because of the complexity of setting up and using these systems.  Mr. Enderle said that apart from simplicity, another feature that would set the XBox Live service apart is that it will be the first service to sell downloadable movies in high definition, at a resolution similar to or better than a DVD.  Until now, he said, most studios have been reluctant to allow cable channels to show movies in high definition for fear of piracy, but that would be less of a threat on XBox Live.  Early next year, Apple plans to introduce a product that, on a preliminary basis, it is calling iTV and that is intended to be a bridge between the computer and the television set. But Microsoft will go into the video business with a different business model. Apple, most analysts maintain, does not make much money selling iTunes content, but makes up for that by selling more iPods, which are extremely profitable. Microsoft, which analysts say loses money on each Xbox 360 it sells, expects to make up for that by selling games — and now video.  “This is a razors-and-blades business,” Mr. Moore said. “I’ve taken the hit on the razor. And the ability of Microsoft to offer more blades gives consumers more choice and drives more revenue.”  The video downloads, especially those in high definition, will take up a lot of space. Microsoft says a one-hour television program in high definition will take up about 2 gigabytes of the console’s standard 20-gigabyte hard drive. Microsoft says the Xbox will play both movies and TV shows as they are being downloaded, although with larger files there will be a delay before playback starts, in contrast to the video-on-demand services offered by cable companies. High-definition movies will take an especially long while, depending on the speed of the Internet connection. "

                "It was nearly a decade ago that a young Microsoft programmer named J. Allard sounded the alarm and convinced Bill Gates that the Internet was a threat to the dominance of the Microsoft Windows operating system. On Monday, Microsoft will announce Mr. Allard's next big gamble: an ambitious billion-dollar-plus investment in an online game service to be called Xbox Live. Microsoft hopes to create what it describes as the equivalent of an online Disneyland, globally accessible over the Internet, where gamers who subscribe can find partners for dozens of different adventure, racing and sports games. The company is betting the service will save its Xbox video-game system, which began shipping last November but still lags far behind the industry-leading Sony PlayStation 2, which has nearly 30 million units in use worldwide, compared with only 3.5 million for the Xbox. (There are an estimated four million to five million Nintendo GameCube consoles now in use.) While Sony and Nintendo have online plans, networked game playing is peripheral to their video-game strategies. For Microsoft, it has been integral to the Xbox plan from the beginning -- the wedge with which Microsoft hopes to gain entry to the nation's and world's living rooms and become an entertainment powerhouse. It is a bet as ambitious as it is expensive. When Microsoft opens the electronic doors for its service this summer, the Internet technology in its three data centers in London, Seattle and Tokyo will have more capacity than its own Microsoft.com, which itself is one of the world's largest Web sites. The risk is that Microsoft is entering a quagmire that will soak up vast amounts of investment and lock the company in a bitter, potentially unwinnable battle with Sony and Nintendo, which will each be describing their own online services at this week's game industry convention, the Electronic Entertainment Expo, which starts Wednesday in Los Angeles. For Xbox Live to become a success the company acknowledges that it will have to attract millions of customers willing to pay $50 or more for each game's software and perhaps a $9.95 monthly subscription, in addition to the $40 to $60 a month for the high-speed Internet connection the service will require. Those are big if's, because while video games have become a wildly popular form of home entertainment, online game playing -- so far mainly employing personal computers, not game consoles -- has never appealed to more than a fraction of Internet users, and in almost all cases, only when it is free. Even more daunting is the fact that there is little evidence that video games have expanded much beyond their core audience of adolescent and college-age males. ''Gaming is a very age-specific and demographic-specific device and experience,'' said Mitchell Kertzmann, the chief executive office of Liberate Technologies, an interactive television equipment supplier based in San Carlos, Calif. There have already been well-publicized failures in the online gaming business. During the Internet bubble, start-ups like Total Entertainment Network and MPATH rose and fell on the promise of offering Web game portals for paying PC customers. And Sega, the one video-game company that did start an online service, Sega.net, way back in 2000, has dropped that service and no longer even makes game consoles, now focusing instead on software. ''It only works when you get to significantly high numbers of subscribers,'' said Lawrence Probst, chairman and chief executive officer of Electronic Arts, the largest maker of computer and video-game software. ''We've learned that the hard way with EA.com,'' he said, referring to the company's online computer-game service, whose only profitable component is the medieval-themed Ultima Online, which has about 200,000 subscribers. Another challenge may arise in household geography. In most homes, the video-game console is located in the living room, where the television set is -- nowhere near the high-speed Internet connection in the den. That assumes, of course that the den has a high-speed connection. Microsoft asserts that as many as half of its Xbox customers already have high-speed, or broadband, Internet connections. But so far only 12 percent of the nation's households have broadband Internet, according to Odyssey, a market research firm in San Francisco, and the number is growing only slowly. ''If this service requires broadband, just put it in the icebox for awhile,'' said Nick Donatiello, Odyssey's president. And yet Microsoft's new service does have its defenders, industry executives who think that online gaming can reach a broader audience than stand-alone video games have. ''Microsoft has the resources to make online gaming successful,'' said Charles Bellfield, the vice president for corporate strategy at Sega, which develops games for the Xbox and will offer versions for Xbox Live. ''It may not happen on day one, but by the time gaming reaches the mainstream, it will be doing well.'' Mr. Allard, who is now general manager of Microsoft's Xbox division, argues that Microsoft can create a mass audience by the force of a huge effort and by the company's ability to tap into a latent demand that he said he first detected three years ago. In an interview last week, Mr. Allard recalled the epiphany. While visiting a Seattle video-game arcade with other Xbox designers in 1999 he realized that the longest lines were all formed around the multiplayer games -- the basketball, car racing, tank warfare and other competitions in which players compete on individual or clustered machines. He said he came to believe that it would be the ''social'' experience offered by the Internet that would drive the next major generation of video games. That is why he committed the company to add the $40 to $50 worth of hardware to each Xbox needed to make every console Internet ready. Now Microsoft is ready to tap that built-in capability. On Monday, the company plans to announce that it will begin consumer tests of Xbox Live this summer with a one-year subscription and a headset, for $49, that will enable Xbox owners with high-speed Internet connections to compete and converse with one another online. Despite speculation that the company might use its online network connection to link Xbox users to Microsoft's other services, Mr. Allard insists that Xbox Live will stay focused on gaming. Robert J. Bach, a Microsoft senior vice president in charge of its games division said the company was planning a service that he compared to Disneyland for its safe, wholesome environment -- in contrast to the ''Coney Island'' he said that the open Internet can sometimes become. ''Compare Coney Island to Disneyland,'' he said. ''When you're at Disneyland, there's no trash, no violence and you never see security. That's what we have in mind.'' Mr. Allard invoked to the same metaphor to criticize his biggest competitor's approach. ''I won't deny that I've occasionally referred to Sony's online service as Sony Island,'' Mr. Allard said. Sony, which has said that it will begin selling a $40 adaptor for connecting the PlayStation 2 to the Internet either via dial-up modem or high-speed connection in August, makes no apologies for its approach. Although the company will not attempt to match Microsoft's ambitious online theme-park environment, neither will Sony attempt to charge users for playing its video games online -- at least not initially. If the gaming experiences are comparable for players, a free service based on Sony's market-dominating video-game console could prove an insurmountable rival to Microsoft's fee-based ''walled garden'' approach. Moreover, unlike Microsoft's command-and-control approach to the Xbox Live network, the Sony service will not force independent game publishers to provide their online PlayStation games through Sony's own network. That difference was highlighted when executives at Electronic Arts said last week that they planned an online alliance with Sony but remained unsure whether to get involved with Microsoft's XBox Live. Electronic Arts said it worried it might risk losing its customers to competing Microsoft games. Sony executives, meanwhile, questioned whether Xbox Live could ever justify itself financially. ''If I were Microsoft, I would spend my money first on selling units rather than building an online service,'' said Kazuo Hirai, the president and chief operating officer of Sony Computer Entertainment America. None of this deters Mr. Allard. Just as 3D graphics propelled growth in the last generation of video games, he said, Microsoft's ability to create a social experience will drive the next generation of gaming. ''The pendulum has swung too far in the single-user direction,'' he said. A critical component of the social experience planned for Xbox Live will be the audio headset, enabling players to cheer and jeer one another. The technology includes a ''voice masking'' feature that will conceal the identities and even ages of the contestants -- a Disneyland safeguard meant to deter adult exploitation of children online. Some analysts agree with Microsoft that voice capabilities could take video gaming to the next level. ''You're looking at a service that will become a new phone network overnight,'' said Richard Doherty, president of Envisioneering, a research and consulting firm in Seaford, N.Y. ''By Christmas, Microsoft could become the nation's fourth-largest phone company.''"

                "LOS ANGELES  Microsoft, seeking to expand offerings on its Xbox 360 console, has reached an agreement with a company headed by Peter Safran, the veteran Hollywood producer and talent manager, to produce original shows for distribution on the system. Through his Safran Company, Mr. Safran represents clients like the actor and producer Sean Combs (“Monster’s Ball”), the actor and writer Nia Vardalos (“My Big Fat Greek Wedding”) and the filmmakers Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer (“Epic Movie”). Mr. Safran founded the company in 2006 after leaving Brillstein-Grey Management. Speaking by telephone last week, Scott Nocas, global marketing manager for programming of the Xbox Live entertainment service, said he expected similar deals to follow. “We definitely look at this as the first of many,” said Mr. Nocas. In an interview at his office in Los Angeles last week, Mr. Safran said his first round of programs would all be scripted, as opposed to reality shows, and would probably run under 10 minutes. He said he planned initially to focus on genres, like comedy and horror, that appeal to the Xbox 360 audience, which is heavily concentrated from the ages of 14 to 34, and tends to be more male than female. The first shows are expected to be available to viewers by the fall. Microsoft’s previous forays in digital entertainment include a two-year-old initiative, MSN Originals, to provide original shows for the Web, and an ill-fated foray more than 10 years ago in which it poured about $100 million into Internet shows like the comedy “475 Madison,” about an advertising agency, then quickly canceled most of them. “The Xbox is unique. It operates at a level outside of what we generally consider Web entertainment,” Mr. Safran said, referring to the system’s tight demographic base, which is defined by the appeal of signature games like the Halo series.  The new shows will be available exclusively via the Xbox 360 for a time, then may appear elsewhere, Mr. Safran said. Mr. Nocas said at least some of the shows would be supported by advertising. Current programming on the Xbox 360 includes movies and selections from cable networks like the Sundance Channel and Spike TV. Viewers pay for access to films with points that can be purchased for cash or accumulated through activities on the system. Mr. Nocas said that about 10 million people had signed up for the Xbox Live service. Roughly 18 million of the game systems have been sold worldwide, he said. The Xbox 360 is up against PlayStation 3 from Sony and the Wii from Nintendo in a hotly competitive gaming marketplace. Mr. Safran is the latest in a growing line of Hollywood players who are seeking to tap into the digital entertainment market, where revenue still falls far short of that from traditional movie and television distribution outlets. Filmmakers like Joel and Ethan Coen and stars like Will Ferrell have recently become involved with Web-based companies like FunnyOrDie.com or 60Frames Entertainment. Mr. Safran and Jake Zim, chief operating officer of the Safran Company’s Safran Digital Group, said they expected to recruit established filmmakers for their new productions, but did not plan to seek involvement by major movie stars."

                "LOS ANGELES — Underscoring the importance Microsoft attaches to its video game efforts, Bill Gates has laid out a vision of a future in which gamers using the Xbox 360 console can be connected to others on a personal computer or a cellphone. The capabilities, part of an initiative called Live Anywhere, will be incorporated into the Windows Vista operating system when it goes on sale next year, he said Tuesday. \"The future is making gaming attractive to people of every age,\" he said. For Gates, Microsoft's chairman, it was the first appearance ever in connection with the Electronic Entertainment Expo, the huge annual video game trade show known as E3, which was to open on Wednesday in Los Angeles. His presence underscored the stakes in Microsoft's push to outflank the other two console makers, Sony and Nintendo. Microsoft has a head start. It introduced Xbox 360 last November, and after some initial supply constraints, 5 million to 5.5 million consoles will have been sold by the end of next month, said Peter Moore, a Microsoft vice president for interactive entertainment. He predicted sales of 10 million units by this fall, when Sony will release the PlayStation 3 and Nintendo the Wii (pronounced \"we\"). By this holiday season, Microsoft said, 160 games will be available for Xbox 360, including \"Grand Theft Auto IV,\" \"Splinter Cell: Double Agent\" and \"Forza Motorsport 2,\" for which Microsoft will sell a wireless steering wheel and headset. In addition, an external module for the Xbox 360 to play high-definition DVDs will be available by the holidays. While the PlayStation 3 will incorporate a drive for movies and games in Blu-ray, Sony's high-definition format, the Microsoft device will be used solely to play movies in a competing format, HD-DVD. With Microsoft's Live Anywhere system, game developers will be able to incorporate features that allow users to send instant messages between devices, and see if their friends are listening to music on their mobile phone or working on a PC. On certain games, players will be able to begin play on the Xbox 360, then switch to a mobile phone; they could also challenge others remotely regardless of whether they were using a PC or an Xbox 360. Sony got the week's events off to a start on Monday by announcing that the PlayStation 3 would be priced higher than expected, with versions selling for $499 and $599 - compared with $299 and $399 for the Xbox 360. At a Nintendo press event on Tuesday, there were no details about the pricing of its own new console beyond a promise from Reggie Fils-Aime, Nintendo of America's executive vice president of sales and marketing, that \"we will give you more fun for less money.\" In addition to new versions of its Zelda and Super Mario games, Nintendo also showed Wii Sports, which includes tennis, golf and Ping-Pong games designed to take advantage of the console's controller, which allows gamers to alter the action by waving it in space much like a club or baseball bat. Sony said Monday that it was incorporating motion sensors into the PlayStation 3 controller as well, but Microsoft said it was not worried by that move."

                "AS Microsoft enters the video game market with the release of its Xbox console on Thursday, some investors are placing their bets on allied companies like Flextronics, which is manufacturing the Xbox console, and Nvidia, which provides the graphics chip for the unit. To meet sales estimates of 1 million to 1.5 million game players before the end of the year, Microsoft is moving well beyond its normal marketing channels. The Xbox release includes cross-promotions with partners like Taco Bell and MTV. But even if sales reach that goal, Xbox will not ''move the needle a whole lot'' in terms of revenues for a company as big as Microsoft, said Jeff Bernstein, a portfolio manager with ING Pilgrim funds in New York. Microsoft is selling the Xbox for less than it costs to maked in the hope of eventually profiting on software development and licensing, several analysts said. But Xbox has already moved the needle on shares of Nvidia, a chip maker with a market capitalization of $7 billion. Its stock price has risen 90 percent since the beginning of 2001. It closed on Friday at $53.20. The company, based in Santa Clara, Calif., said earnings for the quarter ended Oct. 31 rose to $44.7 million, up from $28.1 million for the same period a year earlier. The company said it shipped $57.4 million worth of Xbox chips in the quarter, which counted against a $200 million advance Microsoft gave the company for initial Xbox production. ''There's a nice ramp of revenues coming from the Xbox,'' Mr. Bernstein said. Xbox revenues are expected to account for more than 10 percent of the company's revenues in 2002, a Nvidia spokesman, Derek Perez, said. Mr. Bernstein said he expected that Nvidia's earnings would push the stock price to $60 a share by mid-2002. That may not be high enough to justify an investment, he said, considering the riskiness of the video game market. ''You would have to be an aggressive investor to buy it here,'' Mr. Bernstein said. Flextronics may be a more conservative choice. Despite layoffs of about 10,000 employees in late October, or 15 percent of its work force, and a quarterly loss of $330 million, the company has weathered the technology slump relatively well, many analysts said. Because Flextronics makes telecommunications equipment, hand-held computers and a number of other electronic and computer products for a range of major companies, it is not as dependent on Xbox. ''In looking at its business, the Xbox isn't a significant percentage of Flextronics' revenues,'' said Dominic Vignola, an analyst for the Merrill Lynch Global Technology fund. ''But it has the opportunity for a deepening relationship with Microsoft.'' In the last month, Flextronics shares have risen 14 percent, but they are down 22 percent since Jan. 1. Mr. Vignola said Flextronics' business of manufacturing products for companies like Cisco Systems, Microsoft, Lucent Technologies and other major technology players should grow rapidly as those companies focus more of their resources on research and marketing. Wall Street analysts are expecting Xbox to contribute roughly $150 million a quarter to the revenues of Flextronics. Mr. Bernstein's fund is projecting 18 percent revenue growth, which, he said, could push the stock close to $40 over the next six to nine months. It closed on Friday at $22.20. BUT the estimates depend on the success of the Xbox. Ray Scanlon, a software industry analyst at Citigroup Asset Management, said that if Microsoft reaches its sales goal, the Xbox can contribute more than $2 billion of the firm's total estimated revenues of $27 billion in the 2002 fiscal year. That would still consign gaming to the second tier of Microsoft's product line in economic importance, behind the operating system and software divisions, Mr. Scanlon said. Microsoft is likely to keep investing heavily in Xbox for the next couple of years to compete with the two dominant players in the market, Sony and Nintendo, he said. But if Microsoft ever decides to abandon the venture, he said, Flextronics probably has the balance to bounce back from such a debacle better than Nvidia. ''For Flex, within a quarter or two, it could make acquisitions that would make up for or exceed what it loses with Xbox,'' Mr. Bernstein said. ''It's a conservative man's way to play the Xbox.''"

                "SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 12— Imagine your blender breaking down twice. The vacuum cleaner giving up the ghost three times. The espresso maker repeatedly going kaput. Then imagine replacing the item with the same model over and over while keeping your brand loyalty and sanity. Stephano Nevarez can. Since he first bought his $400 Microsoft Xbox 360 in 2006, it has failed three times. Each time, he sent the game machine back to the company and waited weeks for a repair or a replacement. “There’s nothing in the house that breaks down as much,” said Stephano, a 15-year-old high school student from Salem, Ore. Yet he remains a devotee of his 360 console, the more so because he wants to play Halo 3, the latest iteration of a violent space epic due in stores on Sept. 25; it is available only for that game machine.  The game, published by Microsoft, could redeem the company going into the holiday selling season. Untold numbers of 360 owners have watched their machines break down, and then, in many cases, watched the replacement consoles do the exact same thing because of a severe and widespread manufacturing flaw.  But if the Xbox players keep coming back because of Halo 3, and if other gamers buy the console just for the game, then Microsoft could markedly improve its standing in its battle against rivals Sony and Nintendo.  “Halo 3 is Microsoft’s most important game,” said Dan Hsu, editor in chief of Electronic Gaming Monthly, a magazine for enthusiasts. Mr. Hsu, who has seen the game, said it delivers in spades, with one caveat: “Assuming your machine does work, it does what it sets out to do.” The bar is high. Combined, Halo and Halo 2 have sold around 15 million units, making the series one of the most successful game franchises of all time. The game has spawned novels, comic books and a possible movie. The $12.5 billion console and video game business is up for grabs this year. On the console side, Nintendo is off to an unexpectedly strong start with its Wii, a game system that makes its players get up off the couch and move their bodies to direct action.  It has well over 28 percent of the American console market, according to NPD Group, a market analysis firm. The Wii is currently selling at a faster pace than the 360, and the company is releasing its big games this fall, Super Mario Galaxy and Super Smash Bros. Brawl, though neither is as popular as Halo.  Sony, with about 14 percent of the market, was hurt when the release date of Grand Theft Auto IV, a game it was counting on to increase console sales, was pushed back from October into the second quarter of next year.  Microsoft, which has 57 percent of the market, has declined to say what is causing some of its Xbox 360 to stop working, or how many machines have been affected. It has set aside $1.1 billion for repairs, a figure that suggests to industry analysts that the problem could affect a third of the 11.6 million 360s already in the hands of consumers. Microsoft has said that it will fix any faulty Xbox 360 free of charge. The most likely explanation of where the engineers went wrong is that the 360s are poorly designed to deal with the intense heat generated by game play and that computer chips and other electronics may be popping off the motherboard, said Richard Doherty, an analyst with the Envisioneering Group, a technology assessment and market research firm. Mr. Doherty said he thinks that Microsoft, in an effort to put is machine into the market a year ahead of the Sony PlayStation 3, had skimped on product testing. He said that the failure rate among 360s is almost unheard-of among consumer electronics, where having even 1 percent or 2 percent of machines fail is considered a major problem. He has been doing surveys of video game consumers, and results suggest that their patience is waning and that news of the problems is dissuading some potential buyers, he said. Even die-hard users, he said, are wondering why they cannot take their machine to a store to have it checked out, rather than wait for it to break. “It’s dissipating a tremendous amount of momentum they built up prior to July,” Mr. Doherty said, referring to when Microsoft first publicly discussed its $1.1 billion repair fund. “This is going to get worse before it gets better.” But some financial analysts said that the eventual damage to reputation and revenue may not be so profound. Evan Wilson, an equity analyst with Pacific Crest Securities, said he thought that Microsoft’s fix-it-free policy had mollified many avid game players who have been among the first to purchase the 360. Aaron Greenberg, group product manager for Xbox 360, said the repair campaign is aggressive and that the company, while it is not discussing what has gone wrong, is not taking the failures lightly. “It’s our equivalent of the Blue Screen of Death people talk about with Windows,” he said, referring to the derogatory vernacular used to describe what happens when a PC running Microsoft’s operating system mysteriously stops working. In the case of the Xbox 360, affected users have taken to calling the problem the Three Red Rings of Death. That’s because when the 360 dies, three lights on the front of the console blink red. “It started getting really loud,” said Michael White, 27, of Montreal, a high school teacher, who said his system died in April. “You expect somebody’s expensive product to be more durable than that.” Is he infuriated? Not really. “I’m a happy customer,” he said, given it only took three weeks to repair and he likes the games on the system. Others are feeling slightly less generous — or, at least, their spouses are. “My wife told me she didn’t want me to buy anymore Microsoft consoles,” said Joshua Bridges, an accountant in Spring, Tex. “But I told her I’m a huge fan of the games that come out for this platform.” Chief among his interests is Halo 3. He said he likes the fast-twitch action, but particularly the story, which involves soldiers battling against an alien race called the Covenant for control of a destructive force called the Halo. Halo 3 is the last in a trilogy. When it comes out on Sept. 25, the avid fans will be waiting in line at video game retailers across the country. More than one million units have already been ordered.  For the last three years, a team of 250 full-time and part-time designers and engineers at Bungie Studios, the development house that is owned by Microsoft, have been assembling Halo 3, said Frank O’Connor, the game’s head writer. (He declined to say how much money they spent on the game). Developers felt enormous pressure, he said, and he hopes this version will be the most popular ever, particularly given new features, like the ability of players to record and make short movies of the action they just played. “Instead of being able to say: remember the time I did that one thing? Now they’ll be able to save it and show it,” Mr. O’Connor said. One question is whether it can help Microsoft sell more consoles to mainstream consumers, or to those who may be concerned about the reliability of the 360 systems. But there is little doubt the faithful will be there in force, and thrilled about it, having forgiven Microsoft for the flaws in its console. “I’m on my third 360,” said Benjamin Lin, an 18-year-old Halo enthusiast from Seattle, “and it’s working great for me.”"

                "Ethan Thomas is an F.B.I. agent hunting serial killers and Kameo is a princess who must save her family, but both have a much more important objective: to persuade gamers to spend $300 on Microsoft's new game console, the Xbox 360. Ethan and Kameo are among the first wave of video-game protagonists for the 360. Ethan stars in Monolith's action-horror game Condemned: Criminal Origins as a G-man on the trail of the man who framed him for murder. The search has Ethan creeping, flashlight in hand, through a series of abandoned buildings populated by violent junkies and, later on, humanoid creatures that skitter along the ground. To survive you have to improvise weapons, arming yourself with a mannequin arm, a piece of steam pipe or the blade from a paper cutter, although from time to time you find a handy fire ax or even a gun loaded with a handful of bullets. Your attackers are smart, hiding behind pillars to ambush you. You can paralyze one with your Taser and grab his weapon, but your foe will immediately rearm by pulling a pipe off a wall or grabbing a table leg. Combat is well done and exciting, but other parts of the game are annoying. The biggest aggravation is locating specific weapons to get through doors; an ax breaks through a wooden door, but only a shovel can snap open the lock on a metal gate. Movement is slow; you can sprint short distances but generally are forced to walk, which creates tension when you enter a room but is infuriating when you just want to quickly run through the halls to find a shovel. To make things worse, by default sprinting is initiated by the awkward method of pushing the left analog stick on the controller, although you can assign sprint to the left trigger, which then forces you to use the left analog stick for blocking attacks. Someone should be hit a couple of times in the head with a mannequin arm for that decision. Like Monolith's recent shooter F.E.A.R., Condemned has an intriguing premise that completely falls apart by the end, but while the game's designers should consider taking a few writing classes, they really know how to scare people. It is wonderfully creepy to walk through a deserted, ruined shopping mall as Christmas Muzak endlessly plays. The game is also creepy in another way; you spend much of it essentially beating homeless people to death with pipes. Admittedly, these people attack you, and in fact will often attack and kill one another if you just get out of their way, but I still found it disturbing. Depicting homeless junkies as subhuman monsters unsettles me, although this is less of an issue later in the game as your enemies become increasingly grotesque. It is less disquieting to battle the trolls and rock creatures that populate Rare's considerably lighter action-adventure game Kameo: Elements of Power, in which the titular hero is able to transform herself into a variety of useful creatures. After her family is kidnapped by a troll king in league with her evil sister, Kameo's rescue attempt ends abruptly with the loss of the elemental powers that allow her to transform. The powers, each represented by a cute creature held captive by a shadow demon, must be freed one by one. With each rescue Kameo gains the ability to become that creature and use its powers to access new areas of the game. As the yetilike beast Chilla she can climb ice walls, while as a living ball called Major Ruin she can roll up ramps. Kameo can also use special, hard-to-find flowers to upgrade her creature's powers; the dragon Ash proved extremely useful in battles after I gained the power to release fire tornadoes to suck in enemies. Kameo is generally enjoyable but hampered by awkward controls; it is difficult to aim projectiles, and the underwater levels in which you must use Kameo's aquatic incarnation Deep Blue are utterly painful as you laboriously try to steer through the water and desperately try to aim water missiles in the right direction. The game also has an incredibly annoying help system. The hints it gives are useful, but the game won't shut up about them. As you play, a voice constantly repeats that help is available, as if even after being told the first 100 times the designers were convinced you would forget. You can make the voice shut up by turning off hints, but then when you need help you have to go into options and turn hints on, then turn them off again after, so you don't have to listen to the game blather on. Kameo is most notable for its gorgeously rendered graphics. The 360's processing power allows for many nice visual effects and lets the game put an amazing number of objects on screen. It is stunning the first time the camera pulls back from a troll battle to show what seem to be thousands of soldiers grappling. Kameo is among the most graphically advanced console games on the market, yet I was considerably more entranced this month by Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King, a turn-based role-playing game developed by Level 5 for the aging PlayStation 2 console. With a simple, pastoral cartoon style reminiscent of the films of Hayao Miyazaki and a lovely symphonic score, Dragon has a low-key charm and humor that trump cutting-edge graphics. Dragon is the episodic tale of a band of adventurers searching for the evil sorcerer Dhoulmagus. Following reports of the sorcerer, they travel from town to town, along the way helping the occasional distressed stranger. As with any role-playing game, most of your time is spent fighting off random monster attacks. Enemies tend to be more goofy than frightening; and you will face cat monsters that occasionally stop attacking to lick themselves, or giant frogs that turn around to reveal that their backsides are long-tongued demonic faces that attack by licking. Your party fights with weapons and magic, although each member can learn some other interesting skills. One female character can stop a monster from attacking by throwing a kiss, paralyzing it with desire. There's nothing especially original in Dragon's old-fashioned gameplay, but it does it all beautifully. The game also works hard to root out the most annoying traits of role-playing games. Unlike games in which you spend an hour fighting monsters, gaining better weaponry and skills only to die in a big battle and lose all your progress, in this game the death of everyone in your party simply results in the loss of some gold and your return to the nearest town. The game offers shortcuts to previously visited locales and a way to exit dungeons instantly. Dragon has witty dialogue, interesting characters and engaging battles, yet for me it is perhaps most notable for being one of the least annoying role-playing games ever made. Dragon proves that, while the 360 is a beautiful machine whose elegant design and raw power easily best the competition, you don't really need it. If you have an Xbox 360, Kameo and Condemned are both worth playing, but neither is essential. Great games come when game designers know a platform well enough to concentrate on their vision rather than the technology, so expect the best 360 games to turn up in a few years. Just around the time Microsoft comes out with a brand-new console.

                "The transition to a new generation of video game consoles kicks off tonight at midnight when retailers begin selling Microsoft's Xbox 360. The event is a much-anticipated step in an intensifying business battle between Microsoft, a relative newcomer to the video game industry, and Sony and Nintendo. Sony plans to release its own successor console, PlayStation 3, in the spring, while Nintendo is expected to follow later in 2006. The new consoles are, in general, considerably more powerful than their predecessors, but they will be more expensive, as will the games made to be played on them. The high-end version of the Xbox 360 is priced at $399 and the basic version at $299, though some enthusiasts are not blinking. \"I'll be there at midnight,\" said Ibe Ozobia Jr., 31, who said he planned to pick up his new Xbox at a local retailer in Las Vegas, where he lives. Mr. Ozobia placed an advance order for the console in June, making sure he would not miss out if there is a shortage. And, he said, he likes to be on the cutting edge. \"I can't deal with old technology,\" said Mr. Ozobia, who works in technical support at a computer company and spends 30 hours a week playing video games. For Microsoft, the challenge is whether it can build its base of consumers beyond the hard-core game players that supported the first version of the Xbox, which came out in 2001. A key to Microsoft's success is whether there will be enough mainstream video games to attract a range of consumers to the console, industry analysts said. Analysts have said it is too soon to say whether that is the case, though they consider the number of games available at the outset, 18, to be relatively healthy. Some Wall Street analysts said they were puzzled by the question of how many consoles would be immediately available for sale. Microsoft has declined to comment about its supply, leaving analysts to estimate that there are two million to three million to be distributed in North America, Europe and Japan. Sales in Europe begin on Dec. 3, and in Japan on Dec. 10. Microsoft has said that within 90 days, it expects to ship 2.75 million to 3 million consoles worldwide. Wall Street analysts expect a shortage in the United States, with some saying Microsoft has purposely stoked demand beyond the company's ability to meet it. Indeed, some stores have already sold out their allotment through advance orders and Internet sales. GameStop, the nation's biggest video game specialty retailer with 3,500 stores, sold out its initial order two weeks ago. Individual stores have been calling consumers, telling them to show up within 48 hours of the introduction or risk forfeiting their console and receiving a refund, said Chris Olivera, a GameStop spokesman. Microsoft is \"trying to turn this into the Cabbage Patch Kids,\" said Michael Pachter, an analyst with Wedbush Morgan Securities. He said he expected Microsoft to constantly publicize stories of stores that were sold out to inspire press coverage and water-cooler talk of when the next shipment would arrive. \"It's brilliant marketing.\" Molly O'Donnell, a Microsoft spokeswoman, said the company was not trying to pique demand by holding down supply or withholding inventory from retailers. \"The reality is that our manufacturing facilities are running at full capacity and churning out as many consoles as humanly possible,\" Ms. O'Donnell said."

                "LOS ANGELES — The latest video game consoles can play Internet radio, Netflix movies and YouTube video clips. But Sony and Microsoft, gearing up for a blistering battle in retail stores this holiday season, are reassuring consumers that their consoles are very much about games, too. That message was particularly forceful from Microsoft at the annual Electronic Entertainment Expo, or E3, game convention here, where the biggest companies in the games business show many of the products they will release later in the year. A year ago, Microsoft was promoting its Xbox One as an all-in-one entertainment system for the living room, one that could play games and then seamlessly shift to let people watch television, and change the channels with voice commands. On Monday, though, Microsoft shifted the conversation decisively back to games, announcing a lineup of almost two dozen titles, many of them hard-core shooting games, to be released on the Xbox this year, including an anthology of classic games based on the Halo science-fiction shooter series. “Our goal is to make Xbox One the best place to play games in this generation,” said Phil Spencer, the head of Microsoft’s Xbox business, who received vigorous applause when he declared that Microsoft would dedicate the event entirely to games. While the change in emphasis may seem subtle, it comes after Microsoft was forced to respond to the success of Sony, its main competitor in the games business. Both companies introduced their new game systems in November, but Sony’s PlayStation 4 has held a decisive lead on Microsoft from the beginning. Microsoft said Monday that the company has sold more than five million Xbox Ones. Last month, Sony said it has sold more than seven million PlayStation 4s. At its own event Monday evening, Sony revealed its own slate of upcoming games for the PlayStation 4, including Little Big Planet 3, a new version of a popular adventure game with a character called Sackboy. Sony also said Grand Theft Auto V, a huge hit released previously for older consoles, will be released on the PlayStation 4 in the fall. It will also be published for Xbox One and PCs. Andrew House, the president and chief executive of Sony Computer Entertainment, said the company’s vision is to make sure that its console is “above all else the place to play.” But Sony placed a spotlight on its broader entertainment ambitions, too. The company said it would produce original television content that will be streamed over the Internet to its console, including a show based on “Powers,” a graphic novel about two homicide detectives who investigate superheroes. Microsoft has announced similar plans for original shows. Sony has also sought to out-innovate Microsoft with plans, announced previously, to develop a virtual reality headset, called Project Morpheus, that will immerse PlayStation 4 players in 3-D worlds. Part of Microsoft’s disadvantage came from being more ambitious about the technology in the Xbox One, which includes the Kinect camera and microphone device. The Kinect allows people to play games and operate other functions with body movements and voice commands, and has been included with the console. The extra technology translated into a $499 price tag for the Xbox One, $100 more than for the PlayStation 4. Sony deftly exploited that and other missteps by Microsoft to portray itself as the more gamer-friendly console maker. In response, Microsoft recently announced it planned to introduce a $399 console without Kinect, which went on sale Monday. “They’re back on message,” said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, referring to the change in Microsoft’s emphasis. Game developers still seem eager to create products for Microsoft’s system. The company and its partners showed new versions of “Assassin’s Creed” and “Call of Duty,” two blockbuster franchises that are likely to be big sellers this holiday season. One of the most enthusiastic responses Microsoft got was for the Halo anthology, “Halo: The Masterchief Collection,” which will allow people to play four older installments of the series on the Xbox One console with improved graphics. Microsoft will not release an entirely new version of Halo, known as “Halo 5: Guardians,” until next year. But Microsoft said people purchasing the anthology would be able to participate in a test of the multiplayer abilities of the new game later this year. Microsoft showed another exclusive Xbox game called “Sunset Overdrive,” a kinetic shooting game set in an apocalyptic urban landscape populated by mutants. Sony and Microsoft have both enjoyed strong sales of their new systems, partly because a third competitor, Nintendo, has struggled with its latest console, the Wii U. All three are being forced to adapt to a market where smartphones and tablets are becoming the most common devices for playing games. In an interview, Mr. Spencer of Microsoft commended Sony for its strong showing since it introduced the PlayStation 4. He said he had no intention of allowing his competitor to keep a lead on Microsoft. “I’m in this to win,” he said."

                "Josh Roberts got his first video game system — Atari — when he was 4, and since then, “I’ve had all the latest and greatest systems,” said Mr. Roberts, 27, an advertising account executive. The roster includes various versions of Nintendo, Sega and Sony PlayStation, the original Microsoft Xbox and now its latest iteration, Xbox 360.   Last year when Mr. Roberts moved with his wife from Los Angeles to Memphis, he didn’t have cable for several months. So he began using his Xbox 360 for something more than his standard fare of games like Guitar Hero II and Madden NFL: he downloaded episodes of his beloved “South Park” as well as the occasional movie in high definition, for fees running from $2 to $6 through Xbox LIVE Marketplace, the emporium accessed through the console’s interface.  “I’ll sometimes also look and see what the top downloads are and check them out too,” he said.   With the continued rise of video gaming — sales of the Xbox 360 have hit 10 million — consumers in that highly prized demographic of males from 18 to 24 are being drawn away from the entertainment provided by the small screen and the multiplex. To bring them back to the fold — and to compete with Apple’s iTunes — Microsoft and its content providers, among them Paramount Pictures, New Line, Warner Brothers, MTV, CBS, A&E and ABC are engaged in some serious outreach.  “We need to find viewers wherever they are,” said Michele Ganeless, the executive vice president and general manager of Comedy Central. “Some of them are firing up their Xbox rather than their cable box. They have so many entertainment options. Being on Xbox is a perfect way for us to reach them in their own environment.”  Since late last November, through the console interface and a points card available in $5 increments from chains like Best Buy, Xbox LIVE Marketplace has offered video-on-demand downloads of movies, often in high definition, and download-to-own episodes of television shows. Microsoft declined to give revenue figures for the service, but claims it has grown by double-digit figures each month since it was introduced. Membership at the basic level is free and as simple as signing up on iTunes.  “We allow a consumer who’s very engaged in games to shift, with the same box, to watching ‘The Departed,’ ” said Ross Honey, senior director of the media entertainment group at Microsoft, referring to Martin Scorsese’s Oscar-winning movie.   Xbox LIVE Marketplace also has some exclusive content, for example, a no-cost high-definition version of a “South Park” episode and some first-look content. Before “The Sarah Silverman Program” appeared on Comedy Central, the first episode was available free in the Marketplace.  There’s a similar plan in place for “American Body Shop,” a series that begins on Comedy Central on July 8; starting yesterday, its premiere episode was available for free download to Xbox LIVE’s more than six million members.   The service currently offers more than 2,000 hours of programming. To prevent piracy, consumers have 24 hours to watch rented material before it is automatically expunged from the console’s hard drive.   “The people we’ve partnered with see this as a good way to re-connect with the consumer,” said Mr. Honey.  For example, the high-definition “South Park” episode which has, thus far, been downloaded almost 400,000 times, contained a message urging viewers to watch for the series’ new season. Warner Brothers promoted the theatrical release of the film “300” on the Marketplace interface.   “We’ve seen tremendous results,” said Michele Edelman, vice president of marketing for Warner Brothers digital distribution whose offerings include current television shows like “Supernatural” and “One Tree Hill,” classic fare like “CHiPs” “The Dukes of Hazzard,” “Scooby Doo” “Yogi Bear,” as well as movies.  And some platforms encourage their own hits. When Warner released “Beerfest” to the rental market, the gross-out comedy became the No. 1 offering on the VOD Xbox platform, according to Ms. Edelman.  “It might be buried in a video store, and on Xbox it’s been able to rise to the top,” she said.  The visual sophistication of gamers is such that they are largely unsatisfied by traditional television broadcasts, said James L. McQuivey, a principal analyst at Forrester Research. “It’s very smart of Microsoft to realize, ‘We’ve got the customers, we already have an Internet connection for millions of boxes, let’s see what other visual treats we can feed them.’ ”  Mr. McQuivey added, “From all the data I’ve seen behind closed doors, it does work.”   What is good for Xbox’s best consumer, the young male gaming enthusiast, Mr. Honey hopes will be good for other segments of the population.  The goal is to broaden the consumer base with younger offerings like Nickelodeon’s animated series “Fairly OddParents.” According to Mr. Honey, Microsoft did a brisk business with a high-definition version of “Happy Feet” when a few weeks ago it was added to the offerings on the service.  “We absolutely believe that ‘Happy Feet’ being available brought families to use Xbox in a way they haven’t used it before,” he said. “And when you bring them there, they start to browse around.”  Indeed, Mr. Roberts of Memphis says that although his wife does not play video games at all, “the movie and TV service on ‘Live’ has her using the Xbox. Because of the service she knows how to navigate the user interface to download the content she wants.”   Anita Frazier, an industry analyst for the NPD Group, a sales and marketing research firm, says Xbox’s expansion of services makes sense.  “It’s where entertainment delivery is headed. It’s a natural evolution for any of these boxes, whether it’s a computer or an Xbox or a PlayStation 3 or Apple TV to deliver a variety of content and whether it’s games or music or TV or movies.”  But, she added, “a lot of it is going to hinge on the user interface and how easy it is to accomplish the downloads.” Not always so easy, according to Mr. McQuivey. “The movie feature as currently arranged is no better than traditional video on demand. The titles are hard to find,” he said, adding, “There are operational things that need to be resolved before they can take it to the next level.”   Mr. Roberts has downloaded a few high-definition movies and “it took hours,” he said. “I don’t think the broadband technology is there yet.” He also finds the Microsoft points card (80 points equals one dollar) an annoying and slightly confusing system.  “It’s like at a carnival where you need two tickets to buy a drink and three tickets to buy a hot dog,” he said. “I’d rather know what I’m paying, and I’d like to see that transaction made in dollars rather than points.”   Xbox LIVE Marketplace, he added, “is not yet at a place where I think it’s made my life easier or more entertaining in my leisure time, but I’m excited for the potential. When it moves faster and the bandwidth is great, then I think it will be very cool.”"

                "There are few places online not full of advertising, but Xbox Live, the Microsoft broadband network that lets Xbox game console owners compete online, is one of them. This week Cadillac will announce that it has struck an advertising deal to incorporate some of its cars in the Xbox 360 game, Project Gotham Racing 3. Virtual recreations of three of its high-performance models -- the CTS-V, the STS-V and the XLR-V -- will be made available as free downloads. Deals like this also represent another source of revenue for video games, many of which now have the online connectivity that can allow advertisers to monitor the viewership of their messages. Cadillac is one of the first companies to advertise on Xbox Live. But Kevin Browne, the Microsoft general manager for Xbox new media and franchise development, said that the company expected to announce between 10 and 20 such deals over the next year. Earlier this month, Microsoft announced that it had acquired Massive, a company that sells ads in games. The Cadillac deal was put together by Play, the video game unit of Denuo, a division of the ad giant Publicis Group that focuses on new media. \"It's another model to distribute advertising,\" said Michael Goodman, a senior analyst at the Yankee Group. He said that the market for advertising in video games was $56 million in 2005, a number he expected to triple this year. For years, racing video games have incorporated increasingly accurate representations of actual cars, which are able to accelerate and handle on the screen the way they do on the road. Software makers usually pay a royalty for the right to use a vehicle's likeness, even though inclusion in a popular game can generate a certain amount of awareness in the young, male audience. In Project Gotham, players who score top times on the Nürburgring, a race track in Germany that Cadillac has used to test vehicles, will receive a \"Cadillac Elite\" status to show off to fellow gamers and perhaps eventually use to receive other prizes. \"But it would be a mistake to capitalize on this space without taking advantage of it,\" said Saneel Radia, a group director of Play. \"The fact that other people are looking at it creates an aspirational value for Cadillac.\" ROBERT LEVINE"

                "AMONG other new features, the new Toyota Yaris has a giant tentacle that reaches out of its roof to shoot enemies as it races through a futuristic tunnel, sometimes within inches of soaring fireballs. The tentacle is not standard on the new models: this Yaris car was devised by a video game company rather than automobile engineers.  The shooting car is the central character of a new Xbox game called Yaris that Toyota will introduce today. The game will be offered free to all Xbox 360 console owners in the United States and Canada, who can download it from Xbox Live’s service. It is also the first Xbox game created by an advertiser to be distributed over Xbox Live.  Like scores of other consumer brand companies, Toyota is increasingly creating its own content like video games rather than relying simply on advertising during commercial breaks. “People can time shift, they can do all sorts of different things to avoid advertising,” said Kim McCullough, corporate manager for marketing communications at Toyota. “That’s why we have to move beyond traditional advertising to do things that are really engaging for people.” Toyota introduced the Yaris, a moderately priced subcompact, in the spring of 2006, and has focused its advertising on young consumers. Yaris is not the first brand to advertise through custom-made video games.  Two years ago, Volvo introduced an Xbox game that emphasizes safe driving; it was given away at dealerships. Doritos ran a contest (www.unlockxbox.com) this summer for Xbox game ideas, and the top five ideas are being produced by professionals.  Advertisers are also increasingly buying product placement space within games rather than creating their own. Advertisers in the United States will spend $502 million on video game advertising this year, up from $346 million last year, according to eMarketer, a research firm. Just over half of that is in the form of ads placed within games, and the rest is for marketers to create their own games, known in the industry as advergames. Advertisers generally view video game fans as people who are hard to reach and do not like commercial messages, said Shahid Khan, a partner at IBB Consulting Group, a media consulting firm. “This group does not want to be advertised to,” Mr. Khan said. “It has to be a really good game. If it is a really good video game, then it won’t matter if it was made by an advertiser.” Of course, advertisers might have trouble competing with the popularity of Xbox games like Halo 3, which was released last month. Within a week, Microsoft announced that the game had more than $300 million in sales, a high level for any game.  Burger King’s Sneak King Xbox game introduced last fall has become perhaps the most well-known advergame. Customers can buy the game for $3.99 at Burger King restaurants (with the purchase of a BK value meal). About 3.5 million games have been sold, according to Burger King. Using Xbox data on game use, the Burger King game equates in time spent to more than 1.4 billion 30-second commercials, the fast-food company says. “Interacting with our characters in the games is actually more engaging than just sitting back in your chair and watching a Super Bowl commercial,” said Russ Klein, president for global marketing for Burger King.  Mr. Klein cautioned that giving a game away, as Toyota is doing, might cause people to be suspicious of the game’s quality. Games in the Xbox Live Arcade section, where the Yaris game will be available, normally cost $5 to $15 a download.  The idea and game design for the Yaris game came from Toyota’s advertising agency, Saatchi & Saatchi L.A., which outsourced production to Backbone Entertainment, a division of Foundation 9 Entertainment. Backbone is perhaps best known for creating the Sonic the Hedgehog games. Toyota is spending in the low millions for the campaign, which includes paying Microsoft to promote it and developing the game at a cost higher than typical casual games. “The level of finish on this is really polished. It had to be,” said Harvey Marco, executive creative director at Saatchi & Saatchi L.A., which is part of the Publicis Groupe. “It’s not overt branding. It’s called the Yaris game, it’s about driving the Yaris around, but we’re not coming out and throwing taglines into the game.” Past campaigns for the Yaris have also centered on emerging technologies. Yaris sponsored short cellphone episodes of Fox’s “Prison Break” last year and ran ads in the game Anarchy Online. Players earned “power-up” points in the game by watching Yaris ads on billboards. "

                "Rockstar Games, maker of the wildly popular and highly controversial Grand Theft Auto series of video games, right, announced yesterday that a new installment of the series is in development for Microsoft's Xbox 360 game console and Sony's PlayStation 3. The announcement came one day before the world's largest video-game convention, known as E3, opens in Los Angeles. As gamers and industry executives from around the globe have descended on Los Angeles, the potential development of a new Grand Theft Auto has been widely rumored, yet yesterday's confirmation is sure to become one of the main topics of discussion on the show floor. (But it appears unlikely that Rockstar will demonstrate any elements of the game at the convention.) The announcement was a blow to Sony because previous versions of Grand Theft Auto have had their debuts exclusively on PlayStation 2, which has helped sell the Sony machines. This time, Rockstar is making Grand Theft Auto for the Xbox 360 simultaneously with the Sony version. In addition, Peter Moore, corporate vice president for Microsoft's games business, announced at Microsoft's E3 news conference that Rockstar would be making add-ons for Grand Theft Auto IV available by download over Microsoft's Xbox Live service. The game is to arrive in October 2007. SETH SCHIESEL"

                "SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 22 - Around 2:30 a.m. Tuesday, Mike La was scoping out a darkened Target store in nearby Daly City, Calif., on his Honda motorcycle when a police officer pulled up. The officer knew exactly what was going on. \"He asked, 'Are you here to buy an Xbox 360?' \" Mr. La, 23, recalled later. When Mr. La said that was his intention, the officer pointed him to another part of the building where a line of customers waited for the store to open. The much-publicized transition to the next generation of video game consoles began Tuesday morning as stores across the country started selling Microsoft's Xbox 360, the powerful new machine that is already the must-have of the season for hard-core game players. They gathered in the rain in Manhattan, where a Best Buy opened its doors at midnight. They stood in line all night at chain stores like Target. Mr. La, a car salesman in San Francisco, had preordered one Xbox 360 from a local EB Games store, which he picked up at midnight. Then he waited in line to buy a second one at a nearby CompUSA store, after deciding not to wait at the Target. He said he was hoping that stores would sell out of their initial supplies and he could make a profit selling his second machine. \"I think I can get at least $800 for it,\" Mr. La said of the system, which costs $399 in stores. Microsoft has declined to say how many consoles it is making available this holiday season. But it has said that it expects to have shipped 2.75 million to 3 million units within 90 days. The excitement among hard-core gamers, partly generated by the limited supply, is precisely what Microsoft is hoping for as it tries to build momentum in the bruising game console business, which has been dominated by Sony. Microsoft expects the Xbox 360 to provide serious competition to Sony's next-generation console, the PlayStation 3, which is due out next spring. Industry analysts and executives said the early buzz around the Xbox 360 might not mean much in the long term. Analysts have widely expected Microsoft to sell out its early, limited supplies of the console, but to eventually sell 10 million of them with relative ease. The real question for Microsoft is whether the 360 can outsell the first version of the Xbox, which came out in 2001 and has sold about 22 million worldwide, compared with about 90 million for PlayStation 2 Paul-Jon McNealy, a video game industry analyst with American Technology Research, said the real measures of Microsoft's success might not be clear until the 2007 holiday season. At that point, he said both Microsoft and PlayStation 3 will have been in the market for more than a year, and will be vying head-to-head for mainstream game players. Evan Wilson, an analyst for Pacific Crest Securities, said the long-term measure of success would depend on whether there were any big hit games for the Xbox 360 that succeeded in drawing mainstream consumers to the console. For customers on Tuesday, the long term did not matter. \"I wanted to be one of the first, if not the first, to have the Xbox 360,\" said Peter Gonzalez, 19, a sophomore at the College of Staten Island, who was the first in line at a Best Buy in Manhattan. He had arrived at 7:30 p.m. on Sunday night and by the time the store opened, he was shivering under an umbrella in the rain. But he said he was elated, and even got a cheer from employees after he made his purchase and left the store. Anthony Cintron, 26, was feeling less buoyant. He arrived in line at 6 a.m. Monday, and by the evening he was feeling cold, wet and under-appreciated. \"My wife thinks I'm nuts and my kids are sleeping,\" said Mr. Cintron, an employee at an elevator business in Long Island City, Queens. \"My feet hurt, I'm cold, but it's worth it.\" For Mr. La, in San Francisco, the results were mixed. He said he felt good about owning the new console, and was optimistic about selling the second one at a profit. But there was just one small downside: after playing Perfect Dark, a shooting game, for about 30 minutes, he concluded the machine was not quite as much fun as he had hoped. \"There was too much hype,\" he said."

                "A video game that depicts a battle between corporate mercenaries and local brigands in far-off space colonies has already won the hearts and minds of Microsoft executives. Now those Microsoft bosses hope the game, Titanfall, will win over enough consumers to pump up sales of Xbox One, the company’s flagship gaming console. Xbox One sales are trailing those of a machine from Sony, Microsoft’s main rival. There is reason to be hopeful: Titanfall was created by a well-known game designer and has already received critical acclaim. In an unusual move for a major title created by an independent game maker, Titanfall is being released exclusively for three Microsoft platforms — the Xbox One, the older Xbox 360 console and Windows PCs. “It’s hard to understate how incredibly important Titanfall is for Xbox,” Yusuf Mehdi, chief marketing and strategy officer for devices and studios at Microsoft, said in an interview. While the Xbox is a relatively small portion of Microsoft’s business, it is crucial to the company’s future as its most prominent hardware success and the linchpin of its strategy to influence the future of entertainment. Microsoft is betting that an exciting game that can be played only on Microsoft products will persuade more people to spend $500 on an Xbox One, $100 more than for Sony’s latest console, the PlayStation 4. In a sign of how heavily Microsoft is counting on Titanfall to lift the sales of its new console, the company said recently that it would bundle the game with the Xbox One while keeping the price for the two at $500, the same amount it previously charged for the console alone. The move was effectively a $60 price cut for the Xbox One since that it is how much Titanfall will sell for on its own. Price is the biggest disadvantage Microsoft has against the PS4. Microsoft’s console costs more because it includes the Kinect camera and microphone sensor with every system. The sensor is designed to let people play games without a conventional controller and to operate nongame functions on the console, like changing cable channels with their voices. Titanfall is due in stores this week after two years of development.  Early reviews have been positive, and its creative chief, Vince Zampella of Respawn Entertainment, has a strong track record. He helped create the wildly successful Call of Duty game series, which has had revenue of more than $9 billion during its 11-year history. If the game is the hit many people in the industry expect, Titanfall could repeat the success of another big game, Halo. That science-fiction shooter, which is owned and still published by Microsoft, ignited a fire under sales of the original Xbox. Since Halo was released in 2001, more than 60 million copies have been sold. As another science-fiction shooting game, Titanfall resembles Halo, at least superficially. But Respawn has put a fresh spin on the concept. And as inexpensive mobile games soak up more time from players, the game is also an opportunity for a big-budget console game, with eye-popping effects and a monopoly over the biggest screen in the house, to reassert itself and its genre. “Titanfall will help propel the idea of high-definition gaming,” said Patrick Soderlund, the executive vice president of EA Studios at Electronic Arts, the company that is publishing the game for Respawn. Titanfall is meant to be played only online with other players, in contrast to other modern games that allow people to play both online and by themselves. This dovetails well with Microsoft’s strategy of giving people more reasons to subscribe to a premium version of Xbox Live, a paid service that is required for people who want to play games against others online. Microsoft is using Xbox Live, which costs $60 a year, to deliver video programming from Netflix, Comcast and a bounty of other media partners. People can play Titanfall as soldiers on foot, outfitted with a variety of weapons that they use to defend themselves amid the ruins of a ravaged planet.  They can leap across chasms by running on walls, parkour style. The most exciting moments occur when players decide to hop into giant robotic suits, known in the game as titans, which they can pilot around, picking off opponents with heavy weaponry. “It was a little bit of trying to do something familiar yet different,” Mr. Zampella of Respawn said. The high hopes for Titanfall stem partly from the pedigree of Mr. Zampella, 44, and Jason West, the co-founders of Infinity Ward, the studio behind Call of Duty, which Activision acquired in 2003. They were forced out of the studio by Activision in 2010 in a dispute over money. Lawsuits between both sides were eventually settled. Respawn, based in Van Nuys, Calif., has about 70 game developers, about half of whom used to work at Infinity Ward, Mr. Zampella said. Mr. West, who co-founded Respawn with Mr. Zampella, left the studio last year. In deciding to make Titanfall exclusive for Microsoft systems, Respawn and Electronic Arts are probably forgoing the opportunity to sell millions of copies of the game for PlayStation. The benefits of their deal, whose financial terms Mr. Zampella, EA and Microsoft declined to disclose, are widely believed to include hefty financial contributions by Microsoft to develop the game. “Microsoft is going to push us because they see us as a game for selling their system,” Mr. Zampella said. Still, Microsoft has to persuade gamers that the Xbox One is worth the extra cost. The first wave of games after the system went on sale in November did not fully showcase the benefits of the Kinect, and Titanfall will not either, since it does not rely on the sensor for any central elements of the game. “There are a lot of people who don’t understand what Kinect is all about,” said John Taylor, an analyst who follows game industry stocks at Arcadia Investment. Sony also deftly exploited some marketing missteps Microsoft made when it announced its console last year, including a decision to give game publishers control over whether people could sell Xbox One games on the used market. Microsoft reversed the decision after a huge outcry from gamers. But by then, Sony had used the controversy to portray itself as the more gamer-friendly system. As of March 2, Sony says consumers have bought more than six million PlayStation 4s globally. The most recent Xbox One sales figure Microsoft has provided was 3.9 million through the end of last year, though not all of those systems were bought by consumers since the figure represents Microsoft’s sales to retailers. In January, the PlayStation 4 outsold the Xbox One in the United States almost two to one, Sony said recently, citing data from the NPD Group, a retail sales tracking firm. “It’s very early in the race, but the danger is if PS4 just keeps building momentum, that could cause them a lot of trouble,” David Cole, a game analyst at DFC Intelligence, said of Microsoft. “The next nine months are really critical for Xbox One. Titanfall is huge in that respect.”"

                " NEW YORK — Microsoft said on Thursday that its second-quarter profit rose 5.5 percent, buoyed by new server software, but that revenue missed forecasts after sales of the video-game console Xbox 360fell short. Net income advanced to $3.65 billion, or 34 cents a share, from $3.46 billion, or 32 cents, a year earlier, the company said. Sales gained 9.4 percent, to $11.8 billion, missing its October forecast of $11.9 billion to $12 billion. The company shipped 1.5 million Xbox machines in the quarter.The Xbox sold out days after it went on sale on Nov. 22 in the United States after a failure to secure Xbox components limited supply. The company had pinned its hopes on holiday sales of the machines to bolster revenue and win market share from PlayStation, which is made by Sony. \"Xbox does have a material impact for Microsoft in the December quarter because of the holiday shopping season,\" said David Hilal, an analyst at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey. \"The fact it was capacity constrained in December will probably create some headwinds for their overall quarter.\" Sales also missed the $12 billion average estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial. Shares of Microsoft, which reported after the close of trading,rose 10 cents to $26.50. Revenue this quarter will be $10.9 billion to $11.2 billion, Microsoft said. Per-share earnings will be 32 cents to 33 cents. The new Windows and Office, coming this year, will anchor plans by Steve Ballmer, the company's chief executive, to buttress sales growth and win back investors who say Microsoft Google in the hottest markets such as Internet search. Profit was bolstered by rising personal-computer demand. Global PC shipments rose 17 percent in the quarter, according to the researcher IDC. That beat company forecasts of a 10 percent to 12 percent rise. Microsoft's sales may pick up in coming quarters with the release of Windows Vista, which will have new features like a built-in search engine for scouring the Web and files on PCs, and an application to organize and display photos. Nokia profit falls Nokia, the world's largest maker of mobile phones, on Thursday reported an unexpected drop in fourth-quarter profit and said cellphone prices might fall. The company also said it planned to buy back E6.5 billion worth of stock this year, Bloomberg News reported from Helsinki. Net income fell to E1.07 billion, or $1.3 billion, from E1.08 billion a year earlier. Earnings per share rose to 25 cents from 24 cents as the company bought back stock. Sales increased to E10.3 billion from E9.46 billion, Nokia's chief executive, Jorma Ollila, said at a press meeting in Espoo, Finland, where Nokia is based. Ollila, who plans to step down on June 1, announced the company's biggest-ever share buyback, underpinning a stock that fell as much as 5.1 percent after the results. Nokia said handset prices, which dropped 11 percent last year, might fall this quarter as sales increase in emerging markets. Ollila will be succeeded this year by the company's president, Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo. Jarmo Nieminen, a fund manager at Nordea in Helsinki, said that \"margins and average selling prices lagged expectations\" as the volume growth is in China and India. The forecast for phone prices \"was a disappointment, as expectations were for an increase,\" he said. Nokia is trying to lift sales and margins by selling more advanced phones in Europe and the United States and luring buyers in growth markets like India and China. Shares of Nokia fell 23 cents, or 1.5 percent, to E14.89 in Helsinki. Nokia was expected to earn E1.09 billion on sales of E10.07 billion, the median forecast of 17 analysts in a Bloomberg News survey showed. The company plans to pay a dividend of 37 cents a share for 2005, up from 33 cents a year earlier, it said in a Helsinki exchange statement. Average selling prices fell to E99 in the fourth quarter, from E102 in the preceding three months and E111 a year earlier, Nokia said. Prices will be \"flat to slightly down sequentially\" in the first quarter, Nokia said. Richard Windsor, an analyst at Nomura International in London, said that Nokia's forecast that prices may drop this quarter \"is negative, given that they have a strong product line-up.\" "

                "I went to the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last week for two main reasons: to speak on a panel about next-generation gaming and to see if Sony would say anything substantive about the PlayStation 3. The panel was over by the end of my first morning in town. By the end of the second morning -- after Sony's news conference and a speech by Sir Howard Stringer, its chairman -- it was clear that the company was intent on saying absolutely nothing significant about the PS3. (So by default, the prevailing assumption for now has to be that North American gamers won't see the machine before November; Japan will get first dibs.) The rest of the show didn't have a lot of video-game content. And so, faced with two more days before my flight out, I went looking for what so many have sought in Sin City: sex. And that's because gadget geeks aren't the only folks who have their major annual get-together in Las Vegas during the first week of January. Quite symbiotically, it seems, the multibillion-dollar sex entertainment industry stages the flashy Adult Video News Adult Entertainment Expo at the same time. That got me thinking about the debate that erupted last year when it was discovered that Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas included hidden scenes, playable only with special software, that used relatively low-resolution graphics to depict mostly clothed digital figures rubbing against each other in sexlike poses. That revelation not only made news across the country, but also propelled Democratic senators, led by Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, to introduce legislation that would have the Federal Trade Commission regulate video game sales. With sex in video games such a hot topic, I figured that the professional pornographers must be working on some pretty-far-out game projects. And so, with the full consent of my girlfriend, I went in search of the latest video games with sexual content. The first thing I realized was that there still aren't any true \"adult\" video games, as the industry calls them. By that I mean that I have never seen a product that worked primarily as an engaging video game while also incorporating X-rated content in an interesting way. Even as far back as the 1980's, the really good games with risqué themes, like the Leisure Suit Larry series and the text-only Infocom classic Leather Goddesses of Phobos, had very little actual sex in them. Instead, they relied on humor and innuendo. On the other hand, almost all sex-oriented games have just been straight-up pornography strung together with a veneer of interactivity. As far back as junior high school in the 80's, I can remember strip poker games for my Commodore computers that amounted to barely decipherable digital pictures of topless women with a few card-flipping animations thrown in. Twenty years later, the graphics and presentation are a lot better, but the idea is still mostly the same. For example, one of the highest-profile interactive products in Las Vegas last week was a DVD called Virtual Blackjack with Gina Lynn, due out this month. Evan Brimstone, the project's producer, said he worked for 18 months trying to shoehorn a playable blackjack system onto a DVD. As the player wins hands, Ms. Lynn performs various explicit scenes. The challenge facing the industry is that for any video game to break through, it really has to deliver on the game part. Otherwise, the player might as well go straight for the hardcore stuff readily available all over the Internet. Ms. Lynn seemed to perfectly grasp that the play, not the sex, is the thing. \"With a movie they don't have to work for it,\" she said, stepping away from an autograph session with fans. \"But in the game you don't get to see anything unless you win. With a game they feel like they accomplished something and they win a prize, and the prize is me. They can watch any movie just to see sex. But with a game they get to feel like they've won, and hopefully that keeps them playing.\" In the end, though, most of the games out there with sexual content are still just a matter of picking a path to follow. It is a problem familiar to Joone, founder of Digital Playground, a leader in interactive pornography since the early 1990's. Digital Playground started the popular Virtual Sex DVD series, which has included big-name porn stars like Jenna Jameson, Tera Patrick and Jill Kelly, and is now beginning to stream explicit clips to video iPod users. \"When the DVD came out it actually became harder to achieve the interactivity because with the DVD you couldn't save,\" said Joone, who uses only one name. \"You could switch camera angles and you could switch positions, but you couldn't save your experience and play it back.\" Now, with high-definition movie formats like HD-DVD and Blu-ray on the way, Joone said he hoped that the industry could create new interactive features that allowed users both to create and to save their preferred path through a film or scene. But why no real video games with sexual content on real video game systems? In the end, it is mostly because the big-name console makers are afraid of the potential backlash. While anyone can make and sell a PC game, selling a game for a living-room console requires approval from the system's manufacturer. \"We thought we would be building bigger, more sophisticated games by now like you see on PlayStation and Xbox,\" Joone said, \"but the problem is that Sony and Microsoft are the gatekeepers and they don't want it. Also, we know a lot of users would like our content on a PSP, but Sony controls that and they say that if it's hard core it's not going on the PSP. You can do soft core only.\" But despite all the warmed-over concepts, there were a few flashes of real creativity. The most interesting project I saw was a demonstration of a massively multiplayer online game called Naughty America: The Game. The graphics, which looked a lot like the Sims game, were nothing special, but the concept was fascinating: to bring together gaming and online dating. Dusty Lillo, a Naughty America spokesman, said the game was not meant for immediate sexual gratification. \"This is for people who want to form relationships,\" he said. \"This is for people who want to explore their fantasies.\" \"In World of Warcraft, you go up in levels, gain power and add equipment,\" he added. \"In our game, you add prestige by having sex with more people. But you can't tell other people who you had sex with unless both parties agree to share that information publicly.\" Mr. Lillo said the game, which is scheduled to go into online beta testing this spring, will include a strong identity-verification system. And he joined the politicians and others who have denounced Grand Theft Auto. \"Grand Theft Auto is marketed to children, and in that game you can beat women without their consent and that is unacceptable,\" he said. \"In our game you can't have sex with someone unless it's consensual. In our game, if someone doesn't like what you're doing, they can tell you to stop.\" \"Previous games with sex involved artificial intelligence, but who wants to have sex with an artificial intelligence, with a machine?\" Mr. Lillo added. \"People don't want to play games anymore unless they know there are real people on the other end. What we're doing is using a game system as the bridge to online dating. Most online dating now is on Web sites, and Web sites are so static. This is an interactive environment with a game component that lets people, men and women, actually meet each other and explore their fantasies consensually before exchanging any personal information.\" Don't be surprised if the idea works. Sex sells. Online gaming sells. Online dating sells. If Naughty America can meld the three into a workable system, perhaps then there will be an \"adult\" video game. As usual, responses are invited to thegamer@nytimes.com."

                " SAN FRANCISCO — Note to hard-core video game players: Microsoft says it is aiming for your mothers and wives. In the coming weeks, Microsoft plans to introduce a marketing campaign to expand the appeal of the new Xbox 360 game console beyond the young men who are the Xbox's biggest fans. Microsoft hopes to win a bigger share of the market from the PlayStation 2, the top-selling console made by Sony, by promoting a more family-friendly image for the new Xbox, which will be in U.S. stores starting Nov. 22.The Xbox 360 will go on sale Dec. 2 in Europe and Dec. 10 in Japan, Microsoft has said. In 2001, when Microsoft introduced the first Xbox, it focused heavily on hard-core gamers, typically males age 17 to 24 , who wanted a high-end machine with more sophisticated graphics and more complex game functions. The PlayStation and the Nintendo GameCube, meanwhile, put more emphasis on reaching the mainstream market, analysts said. This time, Microsoft is planning a wider attack. Brochures going out to major retailers like Best Buy prominently describe the 360's ability to double as a DVD player, play music from an MP3 player through a television's speakers and even display digital photos on a TV. Its game functions, while impressive, are now only part of the message. The point, said Bill Nielsen, who oversees marketing for the Xbox 360, is to help a game player convince the women in the family that \"this is for you, too,\" The brochure even says, \"Here are some things you might want to tell your wife this thing does.\" Over Labor Day weekend, Microsoft and Pepsi began a radio promotion to give away 9,000 Xbox 360s by Nov. 22. Nielsen said those ads were meant not just to reach hard-core gamers, but their mothers. The Pepsi promotion \"also hits moms,\" Nielsen said, because \"moms make a lot of the final decisions\" on whether the family buys a new game console. Microsoft will also try to showcase more family-oriented games that can be played on the 360. The Xbox has long depended on the popularity of games like Halo, a shooting game, for console sales. But with the new machine, it will promote games like Kameo, an action-adventure game for younger teenagers, including girls. Industry analysts, however, are skeptical that the repositioning will work. They say it will be difficult to alter the Xbox's high-end image. And they point out that nongame features have not sold consoles in the past. The Xbox, like the PlayStation 2, can work as a DVD player, but most users do not use game consoles as substitutes for a stand-alone DVD player, analysts said. \"It's a tough sell\" to market the 360 to a mainstream audience, said Jeff Gerstmann, senior editor at GameSpot, an online gaming review site. \"It's icing on the cake - being able to view photos on an Xbox,\" Gerstmann said. \"But first and foremost this thing will always be viewed as a game machine.\" The biggest challenge in expanding the Xbox's reach, analysts say, is making available more games for mainstream players. Evan Wilson, a video game industry analyst with Pacific Crest Securities, said that even to redefine the Xbox as a multimedia console Microsoft would have to first produce more general-interest games. That will not happen in the next few months. Nielsen said most of the titles available for the holiday season would be sports and shooting games that appeal to the young male market. And the bulk of the initial advertising will be aimed at hard-core gamers willing to pay $299 for a base model or $399 for a model with add-ons like a wireless controller. Still, Nielsen said he was confident that family-friendly marketing could help redefine the Xbox's image as more games of broader appeal become available. The first week of November, Microsoft will begin a TV campaign with commercials on programs with a larger male audience, including many on the Fox network. The campaign will also include print ads in video game trade publications, Internet spots and heavy advertising at movie theaters. Last week, the company announced a partnership with Adidas to put Xbox game kiosks in Adidas stores. Nielsen declined to say how much the company planned to spend over all on its campaign. The early indications are that demand for the Xbox will be strong. Online preorders have been so high that some retailers now take preorders only for bundled packages, which include several games. The Web site of GameStop, for example, offers an Xbox bundle for $699, which includes five games and an extra controller. The stakes are high for Microsoft. Sony and Nintendo plan to introduce new consoles next year. In the game wars, the PlayStation 2 has sold 30 million units; the GameCube has sold around 10 million; and the Xbox has sold 13 million in North America, according to the NPD Group, a market research company. Wilson of Pacific Crest said he expected Microsoft to make two million to three million Xbox 360s available, but demand could well be greater. A shortage might even benefit Microsoft, he said, by attracting attention well into 2006. \"They want to keep interest high all the way through the launch of PlayStation 3,\" Wilson said. "

                "XBOX, the video game console that Microsoft introduced nearly 14 months ago, is technologically sophisticated and, by many accounts, the best way to play games against competitors over the Internet. But the advantages have not translated into the returns Microsoft had hoped for. It has sold nine million Xbox consoles, on the low end of its projections; it continues to lose money on each one it sells; and it remains desperately behind Sony, whose PlayStation 2 is selling at a record pace. Wall Street analysts have mixed opinions about whether Microsoft's early effort has been successful, but they agree that it has a way to go. Avid game players like Brian Green, 26, who spends hours each week on both consoles, have a simple explanation for why Microsoft has yet to make the inroads it sought. ''The Xbox is cool,'' he said, ''but the PlayStation is where the games are at.'' That is not good news for Microsoft, because people tend to buy electronics based on the amount of software they can use. Sony learned that lesson two decades ago, when its technically superior Betamax video recorders were swamped by VHS machines that had more tapes available. Makers of video games are starting to produce more games for Xbox, but the 2-to-1 gap with PlayStation will take some time to close. And while Microsoft, which has more than $40 billion in cash on hand, can afford to be patient, analysts and investors wonder how much time and money it is willing to invest before it starts to turn a profit. The issue is of no small significance. The market for consoles and video games is worth more than $9 billion a year. Even while losing on selling consoles, Microsoft could still make a lot of money from game makers. They pay the console makers about $10 for each copy of the games they manufacture -- and they made well in excess of 50 million games in the United States last year. Games typically sell at retail for $50. For now, though, there are only losses for Microsoft. It declines to say how much it loses on each console, but industry analysts estimate the figure at close to $100. Sony, by contrast, does not sell PlayStation 2's below cost. Part of Microsoft's problem is the ambitious design of Xbox: its chipsets and other electronic components are more expensive than those of the PlayStation. Microsoft has also been unable to realize certain economies of scale because sales have not been as robust as expected. Joseph Osha, a semiconductor analyst at Merrill Lynch who follows Nvidia, a company that makes the graphics processing chips for the Xbox, said Microsoft had had to ''pull back sharply'' on its orders. He estimated that Microsoft had 1 million to 1.5 million unsold Xbox chipsets, which are the brains used in Xbox consoles. Microsoft is too big to have its stock price move significantly on sales of Xbox. But the effect of all that idle Xbox inventory is evident on its profit-and-loss statement. In a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Microsoft said its home and entertainment segment, which includes the Xbox and television divisions, lost $348 million in its most recent quarter on sales of $1.28 billion. In the period a year earlier, the home and entertainment unit lost $180 million on sales of $833 million. On a micro level, investors ''don't like it because they lose money on every piece of hardware they sell,'' said Michael P. Wallace, a video game industry analyst at UBS Warburg. But, he added, ''on a macro level, they're in the No. 2 spot.'' In addition to overtaking Nintendo, which makes the GameCube console, as the second-place console maker, Microsoft has put itself in a position to compete with Sony for years to come, Mr. Wallace said. When Microsoft introduced the Xbox in January 2001, it promised to put $2 billion into the product -- $500 million in advertising alone. It may well need to spend it all. In 2002, according to UBS Warburg, Sony sold 18.3 million PlayStation 2 consoles, while Microsoft sold 5.2 million Xbox machines and Nintendo sold 4.7 million GameCubes. These figures reflect consoles sold to consumers, not consoles that the manufacturers ship to wholesalers or retailers. THE good news for Microsoft is that industry experts expect it to widen its lead over Nintendo this year. Electronic Arts, the world's largest game maker, is projecting that in North America in 2003, Sony will sell 9 million to 10 million PlayStation 2's, Microsoft will sell 2.5 million to 3 million Xbox consoles and Nintendo will sell 2 million to 2.5 million machines. Electronic Arts also projects that Microsoft will beat Nintendo in Europe, the second-biggest market after the United States. Still, Microsoft is particularly struggling in Japan, where it has been virtually shut out of the market, selling a mere 300,000 consoles, according to the company. Throughout all of Asia, Microsoft has sold only 500,000 Xbox consoles, according to UBS Warburg, compared with Sony's sales of 3.67 million PlayStation 2's. Microsoft officials say they are hampered in Asia because Sony and Nintendo, both Japanese companies, have entrenched positions and great control over distribution and sales channels there. But industry analysts say Microsoft should come up with more than excuses. ''If Xbox has any chance of closing the gap against PlayStation, Microsoft is going to need a better Japanese strategy,'' said Michael Gartenberg, an analyst at Jupiter Research. He said it needed to have better games and to burrow into the Japanese distribution channel. Microsoft said it was already making progress on games, introducing in Japan a game called DOA Xtreme Beach Volleyball. The 80,000 games sold out within two days. Robert J. Bach, a senior vice president for the home and entertainment division, acknowledged that the Xbox was continuing to lose money, but he said that such losses were natural with a new business. A better picture of the situation, he said, is how the company is performing relative to its business plan. ''We're doing very well on that basis,'' he said. Analysts said Microsoft must also persuade video game makers to produce versions of their products for the Xbox. According to figures provided by Microsoft but compiled by NPD Funworld, an industry research group, there are 458 games available for the PlayStation 2, versus 207 for the Xbox and 168 for the Nintendo GameCube. Microsoft faces a chicken-and-egg problem: makers of video games won't make versions of their games for a given console unless the machine has a wide installed base, but it is hard to build a base without a lot of games. Some big game makers have made versions only for the PlayStation 2. Most notable has been Grand Theft Auto, the most popular game the last two years. Microsoft said it is in discussions with the game's maker, Take Two Interactive, to persuade it to produce a version for the Xbox. Xbox also suffers because video game publishers will sometimes release a PlayStation 2 version of a game first, then deliver an Xbox version months later. That happened last year with Medal of Honor, a top-selling game from Electronic Arts that came out some six months earlier on the PlayStation 2. Jeff Brown, a spokesman for Electronic Arts, said, however, that the company was increasingly releasing games concurrently for the two platforms. Industry analysts like Mr. Wallace of UBS Warburg said Microsoft needed to find video game makers that would produce hit titles exclusively for its console. To bolster its game portfolio, Microsoft has been in discussions to buy Vivendi Universal Games. Microsoft would not comment on the issue. In the meantime, Microsoft has quietly begun to make inroads with a feature that cuts across individual games: Xbox Live. This is a $50 attachment that lets console owners play games against one another over the Internet. Microsoft, citing figures from NPD Funworld, said it sold 350,000 Xbox Live kits since introducing the service in November. Sony has sold 438,000 of its own online kit, said Microsoft, citing NPD Funworld figures, but Sony has been selling its kit for almost twice as long, since August. Mr. Bach said that these kinds of numbers showed that Microsoft, by sticking to its plan, could succeed, and he has said so to Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates, and its chief executive, Steven A. Ballmer. ''In the conversations I have with Bill and Steve, they want to know where we are on that plan,'' he said. ''We're on that plan.'' The question is whether Brian Green and other gamers are on board, too."

                "Rockstar Games, maker of the wildly popular and highly controversial Grand Theft Auto series of video games, right, announced yesterday that a new installment of the series is in development for Microsoft's Xbox 360 game console and Sony's PlayStation 3. The announcement came one day before the world's largest video-game convention, known as E3, opens in Los Angeles. As gamers and industry executives from around the globe have descended on Los Angeles, the potential development of a new Grand Theft Auto has been widely rumored, yet yesterday's confirmation is sure to become one of the main topics of discussion on the show floor. (But it appears unlikely that Rockstar will demonstrate any elements of the game at the convention.) The announcement was a blow to Sony because previous versions of Grand Theft Auto have had their debuts exclusively on PlayStation 2, which has helped sell the Sony machines. This time, Rockstar is making Grand Theft Auto for the Xbox 360 simultaneously with the Sony version. In addition, Peter Moore, corporate vice president for Microsoft's games business, announced at Microsoft's E3 news conference that Rockstar would be making add-ons for Grand Theft Auto IV available by download over Microsoft's Xbox Live service. The game is to arrive in October 2007. SETH SCHIESEL"

                "Escalating the hard-nosed price war in the video game industry, Microsoft is to announce today that it will cut the price of its Xbox console in North America by a third, to $199 from $299. It already costs Microsoft more than $299 to make each Xbox. Yesterday, Microsoft's rival console maker, Sony, cut the price of its PlayStation 2 by $100, to $199. Sony says it expects the PlayStation 2, which has been on the market a year longer than the Xbox and shipped about 10 times as many units, to soon be profitable at the new price. Microsoft had planned to announce a price cut next week at the Electronic Entertainment Expo, an annual industry trade show in Los Angeles, but acted instead after Sony's announcement. A third maker of video game consoles, Nintendo, said yesterday that it had no plans to lower the North American price of its $199 GameCube system. Chris Gaither (NYT)"

                "The Microsoft Corporation, following a pattern of delays and shortfalls by the makers of video game consoles, yesterday postponed by one week the North American release of its Xbox game system. The company, a newcomer to the console industry, said it still planned to ship a million to 1.5 million consoles by the end of the holiday season. But retailers said they expected to receive about half the 600,000 to 800,000 consoles promised for the first day, which is now Nov. 15 instead of Nov. 8. Despite the delay, which some analysts attributed in part to delays in shipping after last week's terror attacks, several major retailers said they expected fierce demand for Microsoft's first game console. Toys ''R'' Us, Barnes & Noble and KB Toys said they did not expect their holiday-season earnings to suffer as long as Microsoft got its consoles into stores before Thanksgiving. ''We will sell everything we can get our hands on,'' said Maureen O'Connell, chief financial officer for Barnes & Noble, whose online subsidiary Gamestop.com has sold out of advance orders for Xbox consoles and games. A Microsoft spokesman attributed the delay to ''dozens of reasons,'' and would not comment on the impact of air traffic disruptions. The Xbox is the most ambitious effort yet for Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, to build hardware. The company plans to support the Xbox with a $500 million marketing budget. The consoles will have a suggested retail price of $299.99, less than the manufacturing cost. But Microsoft expects to turn a profit from the multibillion-dollar business of publishing and licensing games software. Robbie Bach, chief Xbox officer for Microsoft, said the company had begun to manufacture final consoles at its plant in Guadalajara, Mexico, and would produce more than 100,000 consoles each week after the initial shipment in November. ''We remain very confident in our ability to ship and sell a million to 1.5 million units through the holiday season,'' Mr. Bach said in an interview. But Microsoft appears resigned to an initial shipment of fewer products. Mr. Bach would not reiterate his earlier promise that his company would initially ship at least 600,000 consoles, saying, ''We decided to move beyond that Day 1 number.'' Michael L. Glazer, chief executive of KB Toys, said Microsoft prepared KB for the likelihood of reduced quantities about a month ago. Reached by cellphone at the opening of a new store in Chicago, Mr. Glazer was asked to comment on recent analysts' reports that Microsoft had lowered its expected shipment to 300,000 to 400,000. ''That would be about what our anticipation is at this point,'' he said, adding that the reduced amounts could create even more demand for the Xbox. Shares of Microsoft fell $1.05, or 2 percent, to $49.71, and shares of two companies that make Xbox chips, Intel and Nvidia, lost 7 percent. Intel lost $1.37, to $19.30, and Nvidia fell $1.91, to $26.97. Microsoft is learning harsh lessons about the difficulty of producing a video game console -- lessons already learned by its competitors. Last month, Nintendo delayed the North American release of its GameCube console by nearly two weeks, until Nov. 18, but said it would ship 700,000 consoles, 25 percent more than anticipated. When Sony introduced its PlayStation 2 last year, it initially shipped 400,000 consoles, instead of the expected one million, because of component shortages. Analysts said the aftermath of the terrorist attacks played a role in Microsoft's decision. The company is on strict production schedules as it tries to create and mass-produce a game system from scratch in only 18 months. The grounding of airline flights after the attacks delayed the arrival of important electronics components, analysts said. ''They lost four days they didn't have, and now they gained themselves seven days,'' said Richard Doherty, director of research for the Envisioneering Group, a technology assessment and market research firm based in Seaford, N.Y. Mr. Doherty said Sony could benefit this year from a scarcity of Xbox consoles. ''The one that's in stock is the one that's going home and under the tree,'' he said. But Microsoft has said the true test of its potency against Sony will be the 2002 holiday season, when it anticipates a broader portfolio of games. Sony recovered from its delays last year and became the dominant force in the market, with an expected six million consoles sold by the end of 2001. As Sony improved its production, customers continued to buy consoles, said Jeanne Meyer, a spokeswoman for the online subsidiary of Toys ''R'' Us. ''There were probably a lot of I.O.U.'s in stockings, but people were very patient,'' she said. -------------------- 6 States Criticize Microsoft By Reuters WASHINGTON, Sept 21 -- The attorneys general of six states today added their support to the government's antitrust case against Microsoft and expressed concerns about how the company's new Windows XP operating system would affect competition in the software industry. In a letter sent to the company's chief executive, Steven A. Ballmer, Attorney General William H. Sorrell of Vermont and five other attorneys general said they wanted to ''add our voices to those calling on Microsoft to remedy the antitrust problems that are now evident.'' The attorneys general from Arkansas, Maine, Montana, New Hampshire and Rhode Island co-signed the letter. None are among the 18 states that have joined the Justice Department case against Microsoft."

                "A new line of televisions from RCA may help game players reduce the snarl of dusty wires behind the set. These 11 new models have a special connection, the RCA VPort, that allows Microsoft Xbox owners to plug in with a single cable rather than three. Jeff DeClue, a product planning manager for RCA, said that the specialized port improves game image quality, particularly by reducing ''dot crawling,'' the shimmer that often surrounds stationary text when it appears on a television screen. The VPort may even benefit users of competing game systems or consumers whose tastes do not run to video games. With a special adapter that will be offered with some of the models, it can double as an extra video input that can be used, among other things, for DVD players. The screen size of the 11 television sets ranges from 20 to 36 inches, and the sets are priced at $349 to $1,499. Some models are available now, and the entire series is expected to reach stores by September. Ian Austen"

                " NEW YORK — Microsoft said on Thursday that its second-quarter profit rose 5.5 percent, buoyed by new server software, but that revenue missed forecasts after sales of the video-game console Xbox 360fell short. Net income advanced to $3.65 billion, or 34 cents a share, from $3.46 billion, or 32 cents, a year earlier, the company said. Sales gained 9.4 percent, to $11.8 billion, missing its October forecast of $11.9 billion to $12 billion. The company shipped 1.5 million Xbox machines in the quarter.The Xbox sold out days after it went on sale on Nov. 22 in the United States after a failure to secure Xbox components limited supply. The company had pinned its hopes on holiday sales of the machines to bolster revenue and win market share from PlayStation, which is made by Sony. \"Xbox does have a material impact for Microsoft in the December quarter because of the holiday shopping season,\" said David Hilal, an analyst at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey. \"The fact it was capacity constrained in December will probably create some headwinds for their overall quarter.\" Sales also missed the $12 billion average estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial. Shares of Microsoft, which reported after the close of trading,rose 10 cents to $26.50. Revenue this quarter will be $10.9 billion to $11.2 billion, Microsoft said. Per-share earnings will be 32 cents to 33 cents. The new Windows and Office, coming this year, will anchor plans by Steve Ballmer, the company's chief executive, to buttress sales growth and win back investors who say Microsoft Google in the hottest markets such as Internet search. Profit was bolstered by rising personal-computer demand. Global PC shipments rose 17 percent in the quarter, according to the researcher IDC. That beat company forecasts of a 10 percent to 12 percent rise. Microsoft's sales may pick up in coming quarters with the release of Windows Vista, which will have new features like a built-in search engine for scouring the Web and files on PCs, and an application to organize and display photos. Nokia profit falls Nokia, the world's largest maker of mobile phones, on Thursday reported an unexpected drop in fourth-quarter profit and said cellphone prices might fall. The company also said it planned to buy back E6.5 billion worth of stock this year, Bloomberg News reported from Helsinki. Net income fell to E1.07 billion, or $1.3 billion, from E1.08 billion a year earlier. Earnings per share rose to 25 cents from 24 cents as the company bought back stock. Sales increased to E10.3 billion from E9.46 billion, Nokia's chief executive, Jorma Ollila, said at a press meeting in Espoo, Finland, where Nokia is based. Ollila, who plans to step down on June 1, announced the company's biggest-ever share buyback, underpinning a stock that fell as much as 5.1 percent after the results. Nokia said handset prices, which dropped 11 percent last year, might fall this quarter as sales increase in emerging markets. Ollila will be succeeded this year by the company's president, Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo. Jarmo Nieminen, a fund manager at Nordea in Helsinki, said that \"margins and average selling prices lagged expectations\" as the volume growth is in China and India. The forecast for phone prices \"was a disappointment, as expectations were for an increase,\" he said. Nokia is trying to lift sales and margins by selling more advanced phones in Europe and the United States and luring buyers in growth markets like India and China. Shares of Nokia fell 23 cents, or 1.5 percent, to E14.89 in Helsinki. Nokia was expected to earn E1.09 billion on sales of E10.07 billion, the median forecast of 17 analysts in a Bloomberg News survey showed. The company plans to pay a dividend of 37 cents a share for 2005, up from 33 cents a year earlier, it said in a Helsinki exchange statement. Average selling prices fell to E99 in the fourth quarter, from E102 in the preceding three months and E111 a year earlier, Nokia said. Prices will be \"flat to slightly down sequentially\" in the first quarter, Nokia said. Richard Windsor, an analyst at Nomura International in London, said that Nokia's forecast that prices may drop this quarter \"is negative, given that they have a strong product line-up.\" "

                "SAN FRANCISCO — Imagine your blender breaking down twice. The vacuum cleaner giving up the ghost three times. The espresso maker repeatedly going kaput. Then imagine replacing the item with the same model over and over while keeping your brand loyalty and sanity. Stephano Nevarez can. Since he first bought his $400 Microsoft Xbox 360 in 2006, it has failed three times. Each time, he sent the game machine back to the company and waited weeks for a repair or a replacement. \"There's nothing in the house that breaks down as much,\" said Stephano, a 15-year-old high school student from Salem, Oregon. Yet he remains a devotee of his 360 console, the more so because he wants to play Halo 3, the latest iteration of a violent space epic due in stores on Sept. 25; it is available only for that game machine. The game, published by Microsoft, could redeem the company going into the holiday selling season. Untold numbers of 360 owners have watched their machines break down, and then, in many cases, watched the replacement consoles do the exact same thing because of a severe and widespread manufacturing flaw. But if the Xbox players keep coming back because of Halo 3, and if other gamers buy the console just for the game, then Microsoft could markedly improve its standing in its battle against rivals Sony and Nintendo. \"Halo 3 is Microsoft's most important game,\" said Dan Hsu, editor in chief of Electronic Gaming Monthly, a magazine for enthusiasts. Hsu, who has seen the game, said it delivers in spades, with one caveat: \"Assuming your machine does work, it does what it sets out to do.\" The bar is high. Combined, Halo and Halo 2 have sold around 15 million units, making the series one of the most successful game franchises of all time. The game has spawned novels, comic books and a possible movie. The $12.5 billion console and video game business is up for grabs this year. On the console side, Nintendo is off to an unexpectedly strong start with its Wii, a game system that makes its players get up off the couch and move their bodies to direct action. It has well over 28 percent of the American console market, according to NPD Group, a market analysis firm. The Wii is currently selling at a faster pace than the 360, and the company is releasing its big games this fall, Super Mario Galaxy and Super Smash Bros. Brawl, though neither is as popular as Halo. Sony, with about 14 percent of the market, was hurt when the release date of Grand Theft Auto IV, a game it was counting on to increase console sales, was pushed back from October into the second quarter of next year. Microsoft, which has 57 percent of the market, has declined to say what is causing some of its Xbox 360 to stop working, or how many machines have been affected. It has set aside $1.1 billion for repairs, a figure that suggests to industry analysts that the problem could affect a third of the 11.6 million 360s already in the hands of consumers. Microsoft has said that it will fix any faulty Xbox 360 free of charge. The most likely explanation of where the engineers went wrong is that the 360s are poorly designed to deal with the intense heat generated by game play and that computer chips and other electronics may be popping off the motherboard, said Richard Doherty, an analyst with the Envisioneering Group, a technology assessment and market research firm. Doherty said he thinks that Microsoft, in an effort to put is machine into the market a year ahead of the Sony PlayStation 3, had skimped on product testing. He said that the failure rate among 360s is almost unheard-of among consumer electronics, where having even 1 percent or 2 percent of machines fail is considered a major problem. He has been doing surveys of video game consumers, and results suggest that their patience is waning and that news of the problems is dissuading some potential buyers, he said. Even die-hard users, he said, are wondering why they cannot take their machine to a store to have it checked out, rather than wait for it to break. \"It's dissipating a tremendous amount of momentum they built up prior to July,\" Doherty said, referring to when Microsoft first publicly discussed its $1.1 billion repair fund. \"This is going to get worse before it gets better.\" But some financial analysts said that the eventual damage to reputation and revenue may not be so profound. Evan Wilson, an equity analyst with Pacific Crest Securities, said he thought that Microsoft's fix-it-free policy had mollified many avid game players who have been among the first to purchase the 360. Aaron Greenberg, group product manager for Xbox 360, said the repair campaign is aggressive and that the company, while it is not discussing what has gone wrong, is not taking the failures lightly. \"It's our equivalent of the Blue Screen of Death people talk about with Windows,\" he said, referring to the derogatory vernacular used to describe what happens when a PC running Microsoft's operating system mysteriously stops working. In the case of the Xbox 360, affected users have taken to calling the problem the Three Red Rings of Death. That's because when the 360 dies, three lights on the front of the console blink red. \"It started getting really loud,\" said Michael White, 27, of Montreal, a high school teacher, who said his system died in April. \"You expect somebody's expensive product to be more durable than that.\" Is he infuriated? Not really. \"I'm a happy customer,\" he said, given it only took three weeks to repair and he likes the games on the system. Others are feeling slightly less generous — or, at least, their spouses are. \"My wife told me she didn't want me to buy anymore Microsoft consoles,\" said Joshua Bridges, an accountant in Spring, Texas \"But I told her I'm a huge fan of the games that come out for this platform.\" Chief among his interests is Halo 3. He said he likes the fast-twitch action, but particularly the story, which involves soldiers battling against an alien race called the Covenant for control of a destructive force called the Halo. Halo 3 is the last in a trilogy. When it comes out on Sept. 25, the avid fans will be waiting in line at video game retailers across the country. More than one million units have already been ordered. For the last three years, a team of 250 full-time and part-time designers and engineers at Bungie Studios, the development house that is owned by Microsoft, have been assembling Halo 3, said Frank O'Connor, the game's head writer. (He declined to say how much money they spent on the game). Developers felt enormous pressure, he said, and he hopes this version will be the most popular ever, particularly given new features, like the ability of players to record and make short movies of the action they just played. \"Instead of being able to say: remember the time I did that one thing? Now they'll be able to save it and show it,\" O'Connor said. One question is whether it can help Microsoft sell more consoles to mainstream consumers, or to those who may be concerned about the reliability of the 360 systems. But there is little doubt the faithful will be there in force, and thrilled about it, having forgiven Microsoft for the flaws in its console. \"I'm on my third 360,\" said Benjamin Lin, an 18-year-old Halo enthusiast from Seattle, \"and it's working great for me.\""

                "WASHINGTON — In late January, as China locked down some provinces to contain the spread of the coronavirus, average internet speeds in the country slowed as people who were stuck inside went online more and clogged the networks. In Hubei Province, the epicenter of infections, mobile broadband speeds fell by more than half. In mid-February, when the virus hit Italy, Germany and Spain, internet speeds in those countries also began to deteriorate. And last week, as a wave of stay-at-home orders rolled out across the United States, the average time it took to download videos, emails and documents increased as broadband speeds declined 4.9 percent from the previous week, according to Ookla, a broadband speed testing service. Median download speeds dropped 38 percent in San Jose, Calif., and 24 percent in New York, according to Broadband Now, a consumer broadband research site. Quarantines around the world have made people more reliant on the internet to communicate, work, learn and stay entertained. But as the use of YouTube, Netflix, Zoom videoconferencing, Facebook calls and videogaming has surged to new highs, the stress on internet infrastructure is starting to show in Europe and the United States — and the traffic is probably far from its peak. “This is totally unprecedented,” said Thierry Breton, a European Union commissioner who oversees digital policy and was a chief executive of France Télécom. “We have to be proactive.” To head off problems, European regulators like Mr. Breton have pushed streaming companies such as Netflix and YouTube to reduce the size of their video files so they don’t take up as much bandwidth. In the United States, regulators have given wireless carriers access to more spectrum to bolster the capacity of their networks. Some tech companies have responded to the call to ease internet traffic. YouTube, which is owned by Google, said this week that it would reduce the quality of its videos from high to standard definition across the globe. Disney delayed the start of its Disney Plus streaming service in France by two weeks, and Microsoft’s Xbox asked gaming companies to introduce online updates and new releases only at certain times to prevent network congestion. “We really don’t know how long we’re going to be in this mode for,” Dave Temkin, Netflix’s vice president of network and systems infrastructure, said in a webinar on Wednesday on how the coronavirus could affect internet infrastructure. Internet service providers like Comcast, Vodafone, Verizon and Telefónica have been building out their networks for years to account for increasing demand. But company officials said they had never seen such a steep, sudden surge. Growth that the industry had expected to take a year is happening over days, said Enrique Blanco, the chief technology officer at Telefónica, a Spanish telecommunications company. “In just two days we grew all the traffic we had planned for 2020,” Mr. Blanco said. On Monday, traffic on AT&T’s networks was up 27 percent compared to the same day last month, and last week Verizon experienced a 22 percent increase in traffic on its wireless and fiber broadband service. Wi-Fi calls doubled from their normal volume, the carriers said. In Europe, internet traffic into homes over fixed lines was up more than 30 percent, according to Telefónica. Activities like online gaming and video conferencing have more than doubled, while messages over WhatsApp have more than quadrupled. So much traffic and stress on internet networks has slowed the speed of downloading web pages and apps, according to Ookla. “Congestion is higher,” said Adriane Blum, an Ookla spokeswoman. “We’re all at home, and the activities we’re doing in this unprecedented time are not low-bandwidth usage, which means a lot of activity on a network.” Cisco said demand for its WebEx teleconference service had tracked the spread of the coronavirus. Demand first surged in Asia, then in Europe, and last week it soared 240 percent in the United States. The demand has pushed up failure rates delivering video conferencing, said Sri Srinivasan, a Cisco senior vice president in charge of WebEx. “I don’t know if we’ll soon see a peak, not for weeks to come,” he said. “The reason I say that is because we aren’t seeing traffic in Asia slow down even now.” Internet service providers said they could handle the deluge of traffic but were adding capacity. Verizon, Cox and AT&T said they were building more cell sites to strengthen mobile networks, increasing the number of fiber connections on their network backbones, and upgrading the routing and switching technology that lets devices talk to one another and share an internet connection. Orange, formerly France Télécom, has doubled its capacity inside undersea internet cables. In Italy, where home internet use is up 90 percent, Telecom Italia said its technicians continued to make repairs and add capacity. Vodafone, one of Europe’s largest networks operators, said it had increased its capacity 50 percent in recent weeks through a mix of software and the addition of more equipment in the field. “We’re seeing some signs of stress,” AT&T’s chief executive, Randall Stephenson, said in an interview on CNN on Sunday. “We’re having to go out and do some augmentation of networks, and so we’re sending our employees out there to get that done, but right now the network is performing quite well.” To prevent clogged networks, Europe has taken the most aggressive steps. Last week, Mr. Breton, the European Union commissioner, discussed reducing the bitstreams of videos with Reed Hastings, the chief executive of Netflix; Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Google; and Susan Wojcicki, the head of YouTube. The companies agreed, as did Amazon for its Prime Video streaming service and Twitch, its online gaming platform. Many of the companies then went further. On Tuesday, Netflix decided to switch its high-definition video streams in India, Australia and Latin America to slightly lower quality to reduce the traffic they create there by 25 percent, and YouTube said it would make all global streams standard definition. “We continue to work closely with governments and network operators around the globe to do our part to minimize stress on the system during this unprecedented situation,” YouTube said in a statement. Microsoft’s Xbox gaming business recently asked large gaming companies to release online updates of their games during off-peak hours while it helped focus on the critical internet needs of people involved in the coronavirus crisis, according to an Xbox email reviewed by The New York Times. Video game updates can require great amounts of bandwidth to download. Xbox asked the companies to release updates in a four-hour overnight window in North America, and only from Monday through Thursday. “Microsoft is actively monitoring performance and usage trends to ensure we’re optimizing service for our customers worldwide, and accommodating new growth and demand,” the company said. “At the same time, these are unprecedented times, and we’re also taking proactive steps to plan for these high-usage periods.” While U.S. regulators said they did not plan to follow Europe in asking for streaming and social media companies to degrade their services, they are taking other steps. Last week, the Federal Communications Commission granted Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile temporary access to more airwaves. “The F.C.C. has been coordinating closely with network operators to ensure those networks remain up and running,” Ajit Pai, the agency’s chairman, said in a statement. Telefónica’s Mr. Blanco, who has been living under a lockdown in Spain, said he expected the record traffic to last for some time. It may even become the new normal, he said. In Spain, internet use drops only at 8 p.m., when people across the country go to their windows to cheer health workers and others who are helping to manage the crisis. “Suddenly at 8 p.m. it goes down, then it goes back up,” Mr. Blanco said. “It’s a beautiful thing.” Cecilia Kang reported from Washington, Davey Alba from New York and Adam Satariano from London. Karen Weise contributed reporting from Seattle."

                "The last time I was unemployed was in the depths of the Great Recession. I had recently moved in with my girlfriend, who suddenly found herself with an out-of-work partner who rarely left the house. But she gave me some surprising advice: Play video games. I would have a lot of time on my hands, she said, and while I could and should certainly do other things — housework, exercise, searching for a job — I would mostly be stuck at home with limited resources. Without something to occupy my mind, I’d go crazy. She was right. Playing video games helped ease my mind, elevate my mood and possibly saved our relationship. This year we’ll celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary. So now I’m going to give the same advice to anyone who is now out of work, or otherwise kept at home: Play video games. And don’t feel bad about it. If you’re not a gamer, you might think of video games as simple time-wasters. But for those stuck mostly inside without work, killing time is a real problem. And in the world of big-budget console games, 10 to 15 hours is a fairly short experience. Some can take hundreds of hours to complete. There are online games designed to be played and replayed for thousands of hours. But games are more than just empty time-wasters. In periods of pain, boredom or personal emptiness, video games can serve as palliative care for both the body and the mind. Think of gaming as a personal stimulus plan for a nation of unexpected shut-ins: It’s not a long-term solution, it won’t work for everyone, and it won’t solve the underlying problems — but it can provide limited, temporary relief for some. Video games take many forms, but they are all essentially simulations. And when the real world is temporarily unavailable, a simulated version might be what we need. Among other things, video games simulate work: Even the simplest games give players tasks, objectives, lists of things they have to do, problems to solve and a sense of accomplishment upon completion. And the biggest modern games offer seemingly endless lists of quests and objectives, tasks and subtasks, systems to learn and skills to be mastered. A game like the online shooter Destiny 2 offers hundreds, if not thousands, of hours of play, exploration and study. Set in an intricately designed sci-fi world, it tasks players with taking out wave after wave of alien enemies. It also rewards them for understanding a complex character progression system that involves completing ever-more-difficult goals and objectives, sometimes multiple times, in exchange for rarer and more powerful weapons and armor. You might not actually accomplish anything after a day spent checking off quests and gathering virtual materials, but you’ll feel like you did. Game critics have noted the worklike nature of many modern games for years, not always favorably. But in a world of stay-at-home mass unemployment, even the illusion of accomplishment is probably better than none at all. Indeed, the particular shut-in nature of our current crisis makes video games unusually relevant in a different way: What video games do better than any other medium is simulate places. Open-world games like Skyrim, Red Dead Redemption II or The Witcher 3 are built around giant, explorable spaces, sometimes the virtual equivalent of hundreds of square miles, with elaborate geography and shifting weather. They can take days or weeks to fully explore and at their best can be unexpectedly beautiful, offering the opportunity to encounter animated versions of sun-dappled vistas or foggy mountain peaks, to wander through crowded city streets or stroll past others on well-trod footpaths. Games can give us someplace else to go. That makes games useful in another way. Some of us are shut in alone. But especially in cities, many are now effectively trapped inside modest apartments with family or roommates, and little private space. Games offer a form of personal escape, a way to simulate being elsewhere from the confines of your couch. And for those who are alone, games can also serve as social spaces, virtual fields of play for cooperative adventures or competitive contests. Many of today’s most popular games are online experiences that allow players to engage with friends as well as strangers, to forge digital versions of the same sort of bonds with teammates that can develop in the real world. If you’re new at this, the cost of entry is fairly low: There are thousands of high-quality games available for phones, and many more available to download directly to your computer. Even better, many big-budget games are free if you have a computer or game console on which to play them. Late last year, Destiny 2, released in 2017 as a full-priced game, reinvented itself as a free-to-play experience, with the base game available at no cost (players can pay for expansions). Several of the “battle royale” games that have defined the new wave of first-person shooters are also free: A relatively well-reviewed recent entry, Call of Duty: Warzone, offers several clever twists on the popular last-player-standing formula. Not everyone wants to play online shooters, but for those willing to spend a little there are now subscription services that offer access to a large library of games for an annual or monthly fee. For little more than the price of a standard Netflix plan, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate offers access to dozens of games, from moody, philosophical puzzle games like The Talos Principle to richly animated platformers like Ori and the Will of the Wisps. There are sports games, strategy games, role-playing games and simple twitchy diversions that recall the arcade games I pumped quarters into as a kid. And for those who not satisfied with our current quasi-apocalypse, there even games about viral outbreaks and attacks, from the strategic epidemic simulator Plague Inc., to the deftly scripted post-pandemic action game The Last of Us, to The Division 2, a military thriller set in emptied-out recreations of downtown Washington and New York after a viral bioweapon wipes out most of the population. Maybe that one hits a little too close to home. Yes, games are frivolous. Yes, they are escapist. But the longer the coronavirus keeps social life and culture in isolation, the more we’ll need frivolity and escapism. There’s a limit, of course, to what video games can do: They can’t serve as long-term substitutes for real places, real work or real human interaction. But they can give us a simulacrum of all those things at a time when the real ones are in short supply, and tide us over until the world we actually need returns.

                "Like many young hipsters in Austin, Tex., Michael Burns wanted to make it big in some creative field -- perhaps writing comedy scripts in Hollywood. Instead, he wound up in a dead-end job, managing a call center. To kill time, he made friends with a group of equally clever and bored young men at the company where he worked, and they'd sit around talking about their shared passion: video games. Their favorite title was Halo, a best-selling Xbox game in which players control armor-clad soldiers as they wander through gorgeous coastal forests and grim military bunkers and fight an army of lizardlike aliens. Burns and his gang especially loved the \"team versus team\" mode, which is like a digital version of paint ball: instead of fighting aliens, players hook their Xboxes to the Internet, then log on together in a single game, at which point they assemble into two teams -- red-armored soldiers versus blue-armored ones. Instead of shooting aliens, they try to slaughter one another, using grenades, machine guns and death rays. On evenings and weekends, Burns and his friends would cluster around their TV's until the wee hours of the morning, gleefully blowing one another to pieces. \"Halo is like crack,\" Burns recalls thinking. \"I could play it until I die.\" Whenever a friend discovered a particularly cool stunt inside Halo -- for example, obliterating an enemy with a new type of grenade toss -- Burns would record a video of the stunt for posterity. (His friend would perform the move after Burns had run a video cord from his TV to his computer, so he could save it onto his hard drive.) Then he'd post the video on a Web site to show other gamers how the trick was done. To make the videos funnier, sometimes Burns would pull out a microphone and record a comedic voice-over, using video-editing software to make it appear as if the helmeted soldier himself were doing the talking. Then one day he realized that the videos he was making were essentially computer-animated movies, almost like miniature emulations of \"Finding Nemo\" or \"The Incredibles.\" He was using the game to function like a personal Pixar studio. He wondered: Could he use it to create an actual movie or TV series? Burns's group decided to give it a shot. They gathered around the Xbox at Burns's apartment, manipulating their soldiers like tiny virtual actors, bobbing their heads to look as if they were deep in conversation. Burns wrote sharp, sardonic scripts for them to perform. He created a comedy series called \"Red vs. Blue,\" a sort of sci-fi version of \"M*A*S*H.\" In \"Red vs. Blue,\" the soldiers rarely do any fighting; they just stand around insulting one another and musing over the absurdities of war, sounding less like patriotic warriors than like bored, clever video-store clerks. The first 10-minute episode opened with a scene set in Halo's bleakest desert canyon. Two red soldiers stood on their base, peering at two blue soldiers far off in the distance, and traded quips that sounded almost like a slacker disquisition on Iraq: Red Soldier: \"Why are we out here? Far as I can tell, it's just a box canyon in the middle of nowhere, with no way in or out. And the only reason we set up a red base here is because they have a blue base there. And the only reason they have a blue base over there is because we have a red base here.\" When they were done, they posted the episode on their Web site (surreptitiously hosted on computers at work). They figured maybe a few hundred people would see it and get a chuckle or two. Instead, \"Red vs. Blue\" became an instant runaway hit on geek blogs, and within a single day, 20,000 people stampeded to the Web site to download the file. The avalanche of traffic crashed the company server. \"My boss came into the office and was like, 'What the hell is going on?' \" Burns recalls. \"I looked over at the server, and it was going blink, blink, blink.\" Thrilled, Burns and his crew quickly cranked out another video, then another. They kept up a weekly production schedule, and after a few months, \"Red vs. Blue\" had, like some dystopian version of \"Friends,\" become a piece of appointment viewing. Nearly a million people were downloading each episode every Friday, writing mash notes to the creators and asking if they could buy a DVD of the collected episodes. Mainstream media picked up on the phenomenon. The Village Voice described it as \" 'Clerks' meets 'Star Wars,' \" and the BBC called it \"riotously funny\" and said it was \"reminiscent of the anarchic energy of 'South Park.' \" Burns realized something strange was going on. He and his crew had created a hit comedy show -- entirely inside a video game. Video games have not enjoyed good publicity lately. Hillary Clinton has been denouncing the violence in titles like Grand Theft Auto, which was yanked out of many stores last month amid news that players had unlocked sex scenes hidden inside. Yet when they're not bemoaning the virtual bloodshed, cultural pundits grudgingly admit that today's games have become impressively cinematic. It's not merely that the graphics are so good: the camera angles inside the games borrow literally from the visual language of film. When you're playing Halo and look up at the sun, you'll see a little \"lens flare,\" as if you were viewing the whole experience through the eyepiece of a 16-millimeter Arriflex. By using the game to actually make cinema, Burns and his crew flipped a switch that neatly closed a self-referential media loop: movies begat games that begat movies. And Burns and his crew aren't alone. Video-game aficionados have been creating \"machinima\" -- an ungainly term mixing \"machine\" and \"cinema\" and pronounced ma-SHEEN-i-ma -- since the late 90's. \"Red vs. Blue\" is the first to break out of the underground, and now corporations like Volvo are hiring machinima artists to make short promotional films, while MTV, Spike TV and the Independent Film Channel are running comedy shorts and music videos produced inside games. By last spring, Burns and his friends were making so much money from \"Red vs. Blue\" that they left their jobs and founded Rooster Teeth Productions. Now they produce machinima full time. It may be the most unlikely form of indie filmmaking yet -- and one of the most weirdly democratic. \"It's like 'The Blair Witch Project' all over again, except you don't even need a camera,\" says Julie Kanarowski, a product manager with Electronic Arts, the nation's largest video-game publisher. \"You don't even need actors.\" Back in college, Burns and another Rooster Teeth founder, Matt Hullum, wrote and produced a traditional live-action indie movie. It cost $9,000, required a full year to make and was seen by virtually no one. By contrast, the four Xboxes needed to make \"Red vs. Blue\" cost a mere $600. Each 10-minute episode requires a single day to perform and edit and is viewed by hordes of feverish video-game fans the planet over. More than just a cheap way to make an animated movie, machinima allows game players to comment directly on the pop culture they so devotedly consume. Much like \"fan fiction\" (homespun tales featuring popular TV characters) or \"mash-ups\" (music fans blending two songs to create a new hybrid), machinima is a fan-created art form. It's what you get when gamers stop blasting aliens for a second and start messing with the narrative. And God knows, there's plenty to mess with. These days, the worlds inside games are so huge and open-ended that gamers can roam anywhere they wish. Indeed, players often abandon the official goal of the game -- save the princess; vanquish the eldritch forces of evil -- in favor of merely using the virtual environment as a gigantic jungle gym. In one popular piece of Halo machinima, \"Warthog Jump,\" a player cunningly used the game to conduct a series of dazzling physics experiments. He placed grenades in precise locations beneath jeeps and troops, such that when the targets blew sky-high, they pinwheeled through the air in precise formations, like synchronized divers. Another gamer recorded a machinima movie that poked subversive fun at Grand Theft Auto. Instead of playing as a dangerous, cop-killing gangster, the player pretended he was a naïve Canadian tourist -- putting down his gun, dressing in tacky clothes and simply wandering around the game's downtown environment for hours, admiring the scenery. So what's it like to actually shoot a movie inside a game? In June, I visited the Rooster Teeth offices in Buda, Tex., a tiny Austin suburb, to observe Burns and his group as they produced a scene of \"Red vs. Blue.\" Burns, a tall, burly 32-year-old, sat in front of two huge flat-panel screens, preparing the editing software. Nearby were the two Rooster Teeth producers who would be acting on-screen: Geoff Ramsey, a scraggly-bearded 30-year-old whose arms are completely covered in tattoos of fish and skulls, and Gustavo Sorola, a gangly 27-year-old who sprawled in a beanbag chair and peered through his thick architect glasses at the day's e-mail. They were fan letters, Sorola told me, that pour in from teenagers who are as enthusiastic as they are incoherent. \"The way kids write these days,\" he said with a grimace. \"It's like someone threw up on the keyboard.\" In the script they were acting out that day, a pair of \"Red vs. Blue\" soldiers engaged in one of their typically pointless existential arguments, bickering over whether it's possible to kill someone with a toy replica of a real weapon. The Rooster Teeth crew recorded the voice-overs earlier in the day; now they were going to create the animation for the scene. Burns picked up a controller and booted up Halo on an Xbox. He would act as the camera: whatever his character saw would be recorded, from his point of view. Then Sorola and Ramsey logged into the game, teleporting in as an orange-suited and a red-suited soldier. Burns posed them near a massive concrete bunker and frowned as he scrutinized the view on the computer screen. \"Hmmmm,\" he muttered. \"We need something to frame you guys -- some sort of prop.\" He ran his character over to a nearby alien hovercraft, jumped in and parked it next to the actors. \"Sweet!\" he said. \"I like it!\" In a \"Red vs. Blue\" shoot, the actors all must follow one important rule: Be careful not to accidentally kill another actor. \"Sometimes you'll drop your controller and it unintentionally launches a grenade. It takes, like, 20 minutes for the blood splatters to dry up,\" Ramsey said. \"Totally ruins the scene.\" Finally, Burns was ready to go. He shouted, \"Action!\" and the voice-overs began playing over loudspeakers. Sorola and Ramsey acted in time with the dialogue. Acting, in this context, was weirdly minimalist. They mashed the controller joysticks with their thumbs, bobbing the soldiers' heads back and forth roughly in time with important words in each line. \"It's puppetry, basically,\" Ramsey said, as he jiggled his controller. Of all the \"Red vs. Blue\" crew members, Ramsey is renowned for his dexterity with an Xbox. When a scene calls for more than five actors onstage, he'll put another controller on the ground and manipulate it with his right foot, allowing him to perform as two characters simultaneously. As I watched, I was reminded of what initially cracked me up so much about \"Red vs. Blue\": the idea that faceless, anonymous soldiers in a video game have interior lives. It's a \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern\" conceit; \"Red vs. Blue\" is what the game characters talk about when we're not around to play with them. As it turns out, they're a bunch of neurotics straight out of \"Seinfeld.\" One recruit reveals that he chain-smokes inside his airtight armor; a sergeant tells a soldier his battle instructions are to \"scream like a woman.\" And, in a sardonic gloss on the game's endless carnage, none of the soldiers have the vaguest clue why they're fighting. Yet as I discovered, real-life soldiers are among the most ardent fans of \"Red vs. Blue.\" When I walked around the Rooster Teeth office, I found it was festooned with letters, plaques and an enormous American flag, gifts from grateful American troops, many of whom are currently stationed in Iraq. Isn't it a little astonishing, I asked Burns when the crew went out in the baking Texas sun for a break, that actual soldiers are so enamored of a show that portrays troops as inept cowards, leaders as cynical sociopaths and war itself as a supremely meaningless endeavor? Burns laughed, but said the appeal was nothing sinister. \" 'Red vs. Blue' is about downtime,\" he said. \"There's very little action, which is precisely the way things are in real life.\" \"He's right,\" Ramsey added. He himself spent five years in the army after high school. \"We'd just sit around digging ditches and threatening to kill each other all day long,\" he said. \"We were bored out of our minds.\" Perhaps the most unusual thing about machinima is that none of its creators are in jail. After all, they're gleefully plundering intellectual property at a time when the copyright wars have become particularly vicious. Yet video-game companies have been upbeat -- even exuberant -- about the legions of teenagers and artists pillaging their games. This is particularly bewildering in the case of \"Red vs. Blue,\" because Halo is made by Bungie, a subsidiary of Microsoft, a company no stranger to using a courtroom to defend its goods. What the heck is going on? As it turns out, people at Bungie love \"Red vs. Blue.\" \"We thought it was kind of brilliant,\" says Brian Jarrard, the Bungie staff member who manages interactions with fans. \"There are people out there who would never have heard about Halo without 'Red vs. Blue.' It's getting an audience outside the hardcore gaming crowd.\" Sure, Rooster Teeth ripped off Microsoft's intellectual property. But Microsoft got something in return: \"Red vs. Blue\" gave the game a whiff of countercultural coolness, the sort of grass-roots street cred that major corporations desperately crave but can never manufacture. After talking with Rooster Teeth, Microsoft agreed, remarkably, to let them use the game without paying any licensing fees at all. In fact, the company later hired Rooster Teeth to produce \"Red vs. Blue\" videos to play as advertisements in game stores. Microsoft has been so strangely solicitous that when it was developing the sequel to Halo last year, the designers actually inserted a special command -- a joystick button that makes a soldier lower his weapon -- designed solely to make it easier for Rooster Teeth to do dialogue. \"If you're playing the game, there's no reason to lower your weapon at all,\" Burns explained. \"They put that in literally just so we can shoot machinima.\" Other game companies have gone even further. Many now include editing software with their games, specifically to encourage fans to shoot movies. When Valve software released its hit game Half-Life 2 last year, it included \"Faceposer\" software so that machinima creators could tweak the facial expressions of characters. When the Sims 2 -- a sequel to the top-selling game of all time -- came out last year, its publisher, Electronic Arts, set up a Web site so that fans could upload their Sims 2 movies to show to the world. (About 8,000 people so far have done so.) Still, it's one thing for gamers to produce a jokey comedy or a music video. Can machinima actually produce a work of art -- something with serious emotional depth? A few people have tried. In China, a visual artist named Feng Mengbo used the first-person-shooter game Quake III to produce Q4U, in which the screen is filled with multiple versions of himself, killing one another. Players' relationships with constant, blood-splattering violence is a common subject in game art. Last year, the 31-year-old artist Brody Condon produced an unsettling film that consisted of nothing but shots of himself committing suicide inside 50 different video games. \"I try to come to terms with what taking your life means in these games,\" Condon says. \"I'm trying to understand, spiritually, your relationship with an avatar on the screen.\" But even machinima's biggest fans admit that the vast majority of machinima is pretty amateurish. \"It's like if some friends of mine all broke into a movie set, and we all got to use all the cameras and special-effects equipment,\" says Carl Goodman, director of digital media at the American Museum of the Moving Image, which began to hold an annual machinima festival two years ago. \"We wouldn't quite know how to use it, but we'd make some pretty interesting stuff.\" Yet as Goodman points out, there's a competing proposition. Machinima does not always strive to emulate \"realistic,\" artistic movies. On the contrary, it is often explicitly devoted to celebrating the aesthetics of games -- the animations and in-jokes, the precise physics. Most machinima is probably meaningless to people who don't play games, much as ESPN is opaque to anyone who doesn't watch sports. But for those who do play Halo, it was genuinely thrilling to see something like \"Warthog Jump,\" with its meticulously synchronized explosions. The Rooster Teeth crew has its own hilariously stringent rule for making machinima: no cheating. When they shoot \"Red vs. Blue,\" they do not use any special effects that are not organically included in the game; everything you see in an episode of \"Red vs. Blue\" could in theory have taken place during an actual game of Halo, played by a fan in his bedroom. It's a charmingly purist attitude, a sci-fi version of the \"Dogma\" school of indie film, which argues that movies are best when cinematic trickery is kept to a minimum. One evening in New York, I visited with Ethan Vogt as he and his machinima team shot a car-chase scene for a Volvo promo. Vogt and two producers sat at computers, logged into a multiplayer game; each producer controlled a car racing through crowded city streets, while Vogt controlled a free-floating \"camera\" that followed behind, recording the visuals. The vehicles -- an enormous 1972 Chevy Impala and a Volvo V50 -- screamed along at about 60 miles an hour, fishtailing through corners while plowing into mailboxes, lampposts and, occasionally, clots of pedestrians. The lead car burst into flames. \"That's great,\" Vogt said. \"That's great.\" Though it shares with independent filmmaking a do-it-yourself aesthetic, machinima inverts the central tradition of indie film: smallness. With their skimpy budgets, indie directors tend to set movies in kitchens or living rooms -- and focus instead on providing quality acting and scripts. Machinima, in contrast, often has horribly cheesy acting and ham-fisted, purple-prose stories -- but they're set in outer space. Want massive shootouts? Howling mob scenes? Roman gladiatorial armies clashing by night? No problem. It is the rare form of amateur film in which the directors aspire to be not Wes Anderson but George Lucas. Indeed, with video games played on computers, it is now possible to build an entire world from scratch. The core of any video game is its game engine, the software that knows how to render 3-D objects and how to realistically represent the physics of how they move, bounce or collide. But the actual objects inside the game -- the people, the cars, the guns, even the buildings -- can be altered, tweaked or replaced by modifications, or \"mods.\" Mods do not require any deep programming skills; indeed, almost any teenager with a passing acquaintance in graphic-design software can \"re-skin\" a character in a game to make it look like himself, for instance. (Xbox and PlayStation games, in comparison, are much harder to mod, because the consoles are locked boxes, designed to prevent players from tampering with the games.) I was able to see modding in action one night when I visited the ILL Clan, a pioneering machinima group. Their headquarters are the kitchen table in the cramped one-bedroom Brooklyn apartment of Frank Dellario; a lanky, hyperkinetic 42-year-old, he sat on a rickety folding chair, pecking at a keyboard. The table was littered with four computer screens and laptops, the remnants of take-out sushi and a hopelessly tangled morass of computer cords and joysticks; a huge wide-screen TV lurked behind them for viewing their work. On the night I visited, they were using a game engine called Torque to shoot a short heist movie for Audi, in which two thugs beat up a concert violinist and make off with an antique violin in a van. To quickly create a gritty-looking city, Dellario and his colleague -- ILL Clan's co-founder, Matt Dominianni -- hired a local artist to build a generic-looking urban intersection inside the game. To customize it, Dominianni went onto Google, found snapshots of a few seedy stores (an adult bookstore, a tattoo parlor and a furniture outlet) and digitally pasted them onto the front of the buildings. Then they went to a site called Turbo-Squid, a sort of Amazon for virtual in-game items, and for $45 bought a van that could be plunked down inside the game. When I arrived, they were browsing the site and contemplating buying a few women. \"My God, look at this one,\" Dellario marveled, as he clicked open a picture of an eerily realistic 3-D brunette named Masha. \"I'm going to marry this woman. They've finally broken through to total reality.\" Dellario put the van into the correct location in the scene, then logged into the game to figure out the camera angle for this shot. He frowned. It didn't look right. The lighting was all off, with shadows falling in the wrong places. Dominianni figured out the problem: \"The sun is supposed to be at high noon. It's in the wrong place.\" \"Oh, yeah,\" Dellario said. \"Let me move it.\" He pulled up a menu, clicked on the \"sun\" command, and dragged it across the sky. Now they were finally ready to shoot. Dellario realized they needed an extra pair of hands to manipulate one of the thugs. \"Want to act in this scene?\" Dellario asked, and he handed me a joystick. I sat down at one of the computers and took control of \"Thug1,\" a brown-haired man in a golf shirt and brown pants, carrying the stolen violin. Dominianni was playing \"Thug2.\" Our characters were supposed to look around to make sure the coast is clear, then jump in the truck and race off. Dellario gave me my motivation: \"It's like you hear a suspicious noise. You're nervous.\" I used the joystick to practice moving my virtual character, craning its neck -- my neck? -- back and forth. I have played plenty of video games, but this felt awfully odd. Usually when I am inside a game, I'm just worried about staying alive while the bullets whiz past my ears. I've never had to emote. While Dellario and Dominianni fiddled with the camera angle, I grew impatient and wandered around, exploring the virtual set. I peered in a few shop windows -- they were strikingly photorealistic, even up close. Then I walked down an alley and suddenly arrived at the end of the set. It was like a tiny Western town in the desert: once you got beyond the few clustered buildings, there was nothing there -- just a vast, enormous plain, utterly empty and stretching off infinitely into the distance. This spring, electronic arts decided to promote the Sims 2 by hiring Rooster Teeth to create a machinima show using the game. Called \"The Strangerhood,\" it would be freely available online. \"The Strangerhood\" is a parody of reality TV: a group of people wake up one day to discover that they are living in new houses, and they can't remember who they are or how they got there. In the Sims 2, the animated people are impressively Pixar-like and expressive, making \"The Strangerhood\" even more like a mainstream animated show than \"Red vs. Blue\"; you could almost imagine watching it on Saturday morning. The problem is, the Sims 2 has turned out to be incredibly difficult to shoot with. When the Rooster Teeth gang uses Halo for machinima, the characters are mere puppets and can be posed any way the creators want. But in the Sims 2, the little virtual characters have artificial intelligence and free will. When you're playing, you do not control all the action: the fun is in putting your Sims in interesting social situations, then standing back and watching what they'll do. When Rooster Teeth's Matt Hullum builds a virtual set and puts the \"Strangerhood\" characters in place for a shoot, he's never quite sure what will happen. To shoot a scene in which two men wake up in bed together, Hullum had to spend hours playing with the two characters -- who are nominally heterosexual -- forcing them into repeated conversations until they eventually became such good friends they were willing to share a bed. Shooting machinima with Sims is thus maddeningly like using actual, human stars: they're stubborn; they stage hissy fits and stomp off to their trailers. \"We'll do three or four takes of a scene, and one of the Sims will start getting tired and want to go to sleep,\" Hullum said. \"It's just like being on a real set. You're screaming: 'Quick, quick, get the shot! We're losing light!' \" Hullum showed me a typical \"Strangerhood\" scene. He put Nikki, a young ponytailed brunette in a baseball cap, in the kitchen to interact with Wade, a slacker who looked eerily like a digital Owen Wilson. (To give Wade a mellow, San Francisco vibe, Hullum programmed him to move at a pace 50 percent slower than the other characters.) Hullum pointed to Nikki's \"mood\" bar; it was low, which meant she was in a bad mood and wouldn't want to talk. \"When they're bored, you have to lock them in a room alone for a few hours until they start to crave conversation,\" Hullum said. He tried anyway, prodding Wade to approach her and talk about food, one of Nikki's favorite subjects. It worked. The two became engrossed in a conversation, laughing and gesticulating wildly. \"See, this footage would be great if we were shooting a scene where these guys are maybe gossiping,\" Hullum mused, as he zoomed the camera in to frame a close-up on Wade. Then Nikki started to yawn. \"Oh, damn. See -- she's getting bored. Oh, no, she's walking away,\" Hullum said, as the little virtual Nikki wandered out of the room. \"Damn. You see what we have to deal with?\" The audience for \"The Strangerhood\" has not exploded the way \"Red vs. Blue\" did. The project is a gamble: its creators hope it will break out of machinima's geeky subculture and vault into the mainstream. Though in a way, Hullum said, the mainstream isn't always a fun place to be, either. Before he returned to Austin to work on \"Red vs. Blue,\" he spent six miserable years in Hollywood working on second-rate teen movies with big budgets, like \"Scooby-Doo\" and \"The Faculty.\" \"So now to come to this, where we have total creative control of our own stuff, it's amazing,\" Hullum said, as he watched Nikki walk out of the house in search of a more interesting conversation. \"I just pray we can keep this going. Because if we can't, I'm in big trouble.\" Clive Thompson is a contributing writer for the magazine."

                "SYNTHETIC WORLDS The Business and Culture of Online Games. By Edward Castronova. 332 pp. University of Chicago Press. $29. SMARTBOMB The Quest for Art, Entertainment and Big Bucks in the Videogame Revolution. By Heather Chaplin and Aaron Ruby. 287 pp. Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill. $24.95. Here's a theory that may be neither original nor empirically defensible but feels true: The more fun an activity is, the less interesting it is to read about. War producces great journalism; water-skiing does not. Can you guess where video games fall on this spectrum? In the last few years, a great many words have been expended to report on this flourishing cultural phenomenon. Most accounts begin with a hyperactive presentation of statistics, which we will not rehearse here. This is all you need to know (and perhaps already do): Video games have grown into a huge business, outpacing the movie industry and bulldozing childhood as we knew it. We adults are not safe, either. Whether they admit it or not, you probably have friends who can be found awake at 2 a.m. disemboweling orcs, foiling terrorist plots and scooping up fumbles and running them into end zones. It is the opinion of Edward Castronova, author of \"Synthetic Worlds,\" that such electronic experiences are not merely a hedge against boredom but a profound indicator of where the entire world is heading. Online, off-line; reality, fantasy -- these distinctions will cease to matter as more and more of us pass our time in virtual environments. Economies will evolve as we pay real money for virtual goods and vice versa. Conflicts that begin online will spill into the real world and back. Laws will be written to protect our newfound interests. Castronova's vision has elements of both utopia and dystopia. But mostly he is bullish. Life in these alternative zones may eventually become so fulfilling, he contends, \"that a fairly substantial exodus may loom in the distance.\" He means this, really. Like the Irish and Italians who left their native lands in the late 19th century to come to America, gamers could create a genuine human migration, away from the real and into the virtual. What will be real then? The specific object of Castronova's scholarship is Mmorpgs, the inelegant acronym for \"massively multiplayer online role-playing games,\" which can involve hundreds of thousands of players plugging in from all over the world. A disproportionate number of these games revolve around dwarfs, wizards, quests and magic lands, though the content is becoming ever more diverse. These days, there's a Mmorpg out there to suit the interests of just about anybody. One game, The Sims Online, merely simulates suburban life, and it is madly popular. Castronova is an economist who teaches telecommunications at Indiana University, and among academic economists he is a bold contrarian, if only because he dares to take computer games seriously. My oh my does he take them seriously. In dense, lifeless prose, he sledgehammers away at his major themes, constantly pausing to review the material he's just covered and preview what is to come. His sweeping conclusions are intriguing -- get ready for governments sending agents into virtual worlds and waging war with avatars! -- but he's not a vivid enough writer to animate most of his futuristic abstractions. In \"Smartbomb,\" Heather Chaplin and Aaron Ruby try harder to entertain. They've organized their history of video games as a study of ambitious individuals, breaking it down into a series of breezy, magazinelike profiles of uneven quality. A lot of the original reporting seems to take place at gaming conventions, which is not where one imagines the really interesting stuff happens. But the stories are pretty good, even when they don't break new ground. Rereading the legend of Nolan Bushnell and the founding of Atari is like hearing a bar band play a spirited \"Twist and Shout\" -- enjoyable, but no additional points for Degree of Difficulty. In two spots, though, Chaplin and Ruby really score. In their chapter on Mmorpgs, they sensitively profile David Reber, a 30-year-old Californian who spends every free moment chained to his computer, acting out a series of intense fantasy existences that provide him with the companionship and sense of achievement missing in his real life. Just as Castronova would predict, Reber withdraws from the real world as his fantasy life deepens -- he has lapses at work and when Chaplin and Ruby last check in with him, he's moved back in with his mother. The other winning portrait in \"Smartbomb\" is of Will Wright, the creator of SimCity, as well as its offshoot The Sims, and a new simulation called Spore in which players guide a new creature from its biological origin onward. In an industry that mimics Hollywood's craven predilection for cheap, gory theatrics, Wright stands apart as a humble philosopher in love with the potential of games to expand the human experience. Though Chaplin and Ruby don't have much to say themselves about the significance of video games, they wisely hand matters over to Wright, who foresees a future that might just keep us all staying up past 2 a.m. \"I think one thing that's unique about video games is not only that they can respond to you but down the road they'll be able to adapt themselves to you. They'll learn your desires,\" he says. \"It might just be that games become deeply personal artifacts -- more like dreams.\" Video Game Books Hugo Lindgren is the editorial director of New York Magazine."

                "THE great thing about shopping for video games is that the person you're buying the gift for almost certainly knows more about it than you do. If you have gamers in your life, no matter what age, odds are that they already know exactly what they want. You need only shut up and fork over the credit card. You can use this to your advantage. If you are lucky enough that the gamer on your list has said anything recently about a game or game machine that is not Microsoft's new Xbox 360, the smart move is to drop whatever you're doing right now and buy it. That way, you will not be among the hordes this holiday season already wondering if they can afford to miss a car payment, or maybe a mortgage installment, to satisfy their 360-craving gamer. That is because the 360, with its snazzy graphics and slick online interface, has emerged as the It gift of the 2005 holiday season. Theoretically, the 360 is supposed to cost $300 for a basic unit and $400 for the deluxe version. In reality, the console is sold out across the country and is now fetching $1,000 or so on eBay. And that's before you buy any games, which run up to $60 each. So if your favorite gamer is interested in anything else this year, consider yourself fortunate. Thankfully, forgoing the 360 doesn't mean returning to the Stone Age of, say, Pong. There are still excellent games being made for the current generation of home game consoles -- Sony's PlayStation 2, Nintendo's GameCube, and the original Xbox, which each cost less than $200 -- and Sony's $250 PSP headlines the strong current crop of hand-held units. Moreover, if you have a powerful PC, that may still be your most capable game machine. In any case, both Sony and Nintendo have new game consoles on the way next year. And availability of the 360 is sure to improve in early 2006. There is a chance that Microsoft could show up with a \"surprise\" boatload of additional 360's in the next few weeks. (The word from the company is that it is working as hard as it can to get units to retailers.) Unless you're willing to pay the prices on eBay or other auction sites, the best advice to shoppers who absolutely must have a 360 is to get themselves on waiting lists at as many retailers and Web sites as possible. So those folks you saw camped out on sidewalks before the 360 went on sale on Nov. 22 don't look so silly now, right? Waiting in line for a midnight sale at a Wal-Mart in Moline, Ill., Kara Harvell told The Quad-City Times that she wanted to buy the console for her five sons. Deliciously, the newspaper reported that Ms. Harvell, a nursing school student, \"got out of class by telling her professor that her son wasn't feeling well at school.\" Of course, some people don't like waiting in line. In the (very) few days before the machine sold out, scattered reports emerged of shoppers being held up for their 360's as they left stores. Please don't go robbing anyone. But if you've already gone through the effort of finding a 360 at its regular price, it is certainly worth the extra $100 for the higher-end model. The full version comes with a headset (for making free phone calls over the Internet to other Xbox users), a wireless controller (instead of a wired model) and a hard drive, which you need to play games made for the original Xbox. Top-line games are $50 to $60. The unit comes with a free basic membership to Microsoft's online game service, which lets you talk to other online 360 users and compare scores. But if you want to actually play head-to-head live over the Internet, you need to buy the \"gold\" membership, which costs $8 a month or $50 a year. In addition to playing games with eye-popping graphics, the machine plays DVD's and can display photos from your digital camera on your regular or high-definition television. Luckily, the 360 is not the only game system potentially worth buying this holiday season. There are cheaper and more readily available options, too. Besides the Xbox 360, the other major new game machine is Sony's PSP hand-held. The sleek black unit has a clear, colorful screen that is far more vibrant than one would expect from a hand-held device, and that may be why people on buses and trains seem to be using their PSP's to watch movies as much as playing games. Dozens of movies are now being released on the small UMD data discs that slip into the back of the PSP, which inexplicably comes with white headphones reminiscent of those supplied with Apple's iPods. Over all, the games for the PSP have been lackluster so far, but that trend shows signs of changing. Aimed at adults, the new Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories takes advantage of the PSP's built-in wireless capability to allow multiple PSP users to battle one another through the game's streets and alleys, even as the players themselves are on the go. Next year, a new installment of the quirky family-friendly Japanese game Katamari Damacy is expected for the PSP. Even cheaper and smaller than the PSP is Nintendo's DS hand-held, which costs about $130. Nintendo has long been popular with young gamers, but the new Nintendogs pet simulator is finding fans among both children and adult women. The screens on the DS, which stands for dual screen, are not quite as impressive as the PSP's, but are still clear enough for enjoyable gaming. But rather than play on the go, many people still prefer their video games on the television in the den. With all of the hype around the 360 it is easy to overlook that you can now buy the original Xbox or Sony's PlayStation 2 each for around $150. Bundles that include a console and a few games can be found under $300 on the Web. Nintendo's GameCube console now costs only around $100. Of course, the Xbox, GameCube and PS2 certainly don't have the cachet of the new 360. And most serious gamers already have one, two or even all three of the older systems. But if you are looking for a cost-effective way to introduce a young person to gaming, buying any of the older systems is a smart move. In fact, many serious gamers would argue that the games being made now for those mature machines are actually better than those for the 360, which is still so new that developers have not yet figured out how to fully harness its power. The older games just don't look quite as snazzy. But until Sony's PlayStation 3 and Nintendo's Revolution are released next year, the Xbox 360 is clearly the best gaming machine around (unless you want to consider a top-notch gaming PC, which could easily cost more than $2,000). If someone you know wants a 360 and you can't find it at a reasonable price, perhaps fend them off with a PSP or a gift certificate that can be exchanged for some new games for an existing console. Then promise you'll get a 360, PlayStation 3 or Revolution next year. You may forget the promise, but they won't. Is It Live, or Is It A Video Game? THERE are about 20 games available for Microsoft's new Xbox 360. It does not have a single hit title yet, as Halo became for the original Xbox, and the lineup is still missing some genres, like role-playing games. Nonetheless, games out now do a good job of demonstrating how the next generation of consoles deliver visual and social experiences far more sophisticated than those possible on older consoles. The strongest two genres on the 360 are auto racing and first-person shooters. On the racetrack, Project Gotham Racing 3 lets you speed through detailed recreated cities like New York, Las Vegas and London. You can race in online leagues, compete against \"ghosts\" that simulate your friends' best performances or \"tune in\" and watch from the sidelines as some of the best virtual drivers in the world go wheel to wheel. The shooters put a player in the perspective of a person fighting, often with guns. Among the standouts are Perfect Dark Zero, set in the near future, and Call of Duty 2, a gritty re-creation of World War II. The most visually impressive 360 game is Kameo: Elements of Power, an action adventure that looks like child's play, with its evocation of a Pixar animated film, but is challenging at points. About half the games for the 360 mimic real-life sports. NBA 2K6, which at times could pass for a live telecast, is the most impressive of the bunch. Amped 3, a snowboarding simulator, is easy to play and gorgeous to watch. SETH SCHIESEL"

                "Tomorrow the Xbox, the new video-game console from Microsoft, arrives in stores on the heels of a $500 million marketing blitz. But it doesn't seem as if much of that money is going to the thousands of musicians who have provided the company with songs to use in the games that will be played on it. Though a band can typically make $10,000 to $20,000 when a song is included in a video game, Microsoft has been asking musicians to contribute their music to video games for pennies -- and in some cases no money at all, with no upfront fee and no royalties on the back end. Musicians, from small, independent punk bands to major-label artists, have been accepting this deal, hoping for the promotional boost that comes with being heard in a game that is played obsessively by teenagers across the country. Joining a band is not a lucrative career choice for most musicians. Many who are signed to major labels spend their careers in debt to those record companies, trying to earn back advances and expenses. But the increasing use of contemporary songs in movies, video games and advertisements has meant an unexpected windfall for lesser-known and midlevel artists. Microsoft, however, is changing that dynamic. ''I asked if we could get any money, and they just said no,'' said Larry Cooper, who runs Revelation Records, a punk, metal and hardcore label that has several songs on the soundtrack to Amped, a snowboarding game. ''I almost thought that out of principle, if there's no payment, we shouldn't do that kind of stuff. But I didn't want to snip out an opportunity for a band that might want to do that kind of promotion.'' Of the bands Mr. Cooper asked, all but one agreed to provide free music to Microsoft. ''I think they were just looking for cheap music, and that's why they called a lot of small labels,'' Mr. Cooper continued. ''I asked them who else was on the soundtrack and made some suggestions, but they said they wanted to stick with certain labels because they didn't have to pay for licensing.'' Brenner Adams, a product planner on Amped, said that on his game Microsoft was looking not for cheap music but for an opportunity to expose as many small underground bands as possible. Under Microsoft policy the interview with Mr. Adams was conducted with a company publicist on the line, taking notes on the conversation. ''We're not saying, 'Hey, we want to use your music for nothing,' '' Mr. Adams said. ''We said, 'Hey, we really want to promote these artists and promote who they are and what they stand for.' '' Though Microsoft didn't give any money to musicians on such independent labels, it did offer small amounts to bands on major labels. It made a deal with Virgin Records, obtaining songs from acts like the Gorillaz, Iggy Pop, the Chemical Brothers and Timbaland & Magoo by paying ''small fees and publishing,'' said Brad Fox, the director of artist development at Virgin. The amount of course remains a big contrast to the millions of dollars that Microsoft is believed to have paid to use Madonna's ''Ray of Light'' in its 60-second Windows XP advertisement. ''We're looking at this as a marketing exercise,'' Mr. Fox said. ''There's no way I could get 10 to 15 different artists in somebody's house in front of an active consumer audience for 20 hours a week. If I could get 20 percent of those kids to go buy a record, that's great.'' But the Xbox isn't like other systems, nor are these deals like other deals. Many record labels are operating on the faith that Microsoft will make efforts to promote their bands. Mr. Fox said he hoped that the Virgin artists used in the games would be mentioned in Xbox promotional material, game catalogs and game boxes. But a trip to the Xbox Web site showed that the artists on games like Amped were not mentioned on the box or promotional poster shown online, nor were the bands on any game highlighted in any special way on the Web site. Other promotional efforts, however, have been made: there was a link at the site to a radio station playing music from Amped, and at a recent Xbox promotional party in Los Angeles Microsoft gave away a CD with music from Amped. Mr. Adams noted that most of the cash deals were made with better-known bands that don't need the publicity as much. ''So,'' he said, ''why not turn the decision around, bring the smaller guys up and give them the promotion they can't get anywhere else?'' He said that music from some 240 artists was used on Amped, that in the game the names of the record labels are shown on banners and that players had the option of seeing names of the bands, songs and record labels. He added that the company hoped to stage more promotions with the music. But there is no guarantee that gamers will hear much if any of the music of these bands. That is because in a feature unique to the Xbox consumers have the option of wiping out the soundtrack to a game and replacing it with music from their own CD's. Originally music executives were less worried about artists not getting paid than about the potential for Xbox to become a new Napster, since it has a large hard drive and online capabilities. But in a statement prepared for this article Microsoft said that though music could be stored on the hard drive, it could not be copied on ''CD's, MP3's or any other devices.'' Other executives in the music publishing business now worry that video game manufacturers and even advertising agencies will follow Microsoft's lead and tell bands that in exchange for use of their music at no cost, an extra effort will be made to promote the groups in products and commercials. As it is, artists sacrifice a lot of money and time at the altar of promotion, taking on costly and inconvenient tasks gratis, like performing concerts promoted by radio stations. So, some wonder, in a field in which just about anything musicians do can be seen as raising their profiles, where is the line between promotional and paid work? Jeff Koz, the chief executive of SubZero, a company that brokers deals between advertisers and musicians, said, ''We believe that people should be paid for what they do.'' Mr. Koz has worked with Microsoft on music and sound design. He added, however, that there was a give-and-take between payment and promotion, and lesser-known artists were often given somewhat lower fees in exchange for what could be career-enhancing exposure. ''There's value to cross-promotion,'' he said, ''and we're not privy to how those Microsoft deals went down. Some of those bands might see it as a tremendous opportunity.'' No. 1 and Dropping The new Britney Spears album, ''Britney,'' will enter the pop charts next week at No. 1 with 769,000 copies sold, according to Soundscan, a company that tracks retail sales. The number, a significant drop from the first-week sales of her previous album (1.3 million), reflects a teenage pop demand that is slipping but still hanging on tenaciously as Ms. Spears sagely remakes her image so she has one foot in the teenage world and the other in the general pop market (an approach best summed up by her song title ''I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman''). The following week, record executives say, ''Britney'' seems likely to slip to No. 2 when the Garth Brooks album ''Scarecrow'' makes its debut with predicted sales of more than one million copies."

                "LOS ANGELES — Microsoft, seeking to expand offerings on its Xbox 360 console, has reached an agreement with a company headed by Peter Safran, the veteran Hollywood producer and talent manager, to produce original shows for distribution on the system. Through his Safran Co., he represents clients like the actor and producer Sean Combs (\"Monster's Ball\"), the actor and writer Nia Vardalos (\"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\") and the filmmakers Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer (\"Epic Movie\"). Safran founded the company in 2006 after leaving Brillstein-Grey Management. Speaking by telephone last week, Scott Nocas, global marketing manager for programming of the Xbox Live entertainment service, said he expected similar deals to follow. \"We definitely look at this as the first of many,\" said Nocas. In an interview at his office in Los Angeles last week, Safran said his first round of programs would be scripted and would probably run under 10 minutes. He said his initial focus would be on genres like comedy and horror that appeal to the Xbox 360 audience, which is heavily concentrated from the ages of 14 to 34, and tends to be more male than female. The first shows are expected to be available to viewers by autumn in the Northern Hemisphere. \"The Xbox is unique; it operates at a level outside of what we generally consider Web entertainment,\" Safran said, referring to the system's tight demographic base, which is defined by the appeal of signature games like the Halo series. The new shows will be available exclusively via the Xbox 360 for a time, then may appear elsewhere, Safran said."

                "Looking for an advantage in the next round of the video-console wars, Microsoft has made the first move. Three and a half years after it entered the console market with the Xbox, Microsoft yesterday unveiled its successor, the Xbox 360, a creamy white console that is to go on sale in North America, Europe and Japan by the holiday season. Though noticeably smaller than its squat black predecessor, the console houses three 3.2-gigahertz I.B.M. microprocessors that could qualify it as the most powerful home computer on the market. Indeed, unlike the original Xbox, the new console can act as a home entertainment hub, streaming pictures, music and video from digital cameras, portable music players and computers that run Microsoft Windows XP. Most evidently different, Xbox 360, which Microsoft introduced last night in a 30-minute presentation on MTV, is designed to display games in wide-screen, high-definition format as well as in standard definition. Microsoft's move, after years of secrecy, rumors and fragmentary disclosures, comes as its competitors -- Sony, the undisputed industry leader, and Nintendo, a close third worldwide -- are also preparing presentations of their coming consoles for the Electronic Entertainment Expo, a major industry trade show, in Los Angeles next week. Representatives of those companies said their game systems, Sony's PlayStation 3 and Nintendo's, which is code-named Revolution, are set for release next year. For the game industry, with $10 billion a year in sales in the United States alone, the consoles' arrivals will not only give rise to new demand for game hardware but will set off a new wave of game development and purchases. As the consoles put new emphasis on high-definition video, they may stimulate TV sales as well. One analyst, describing the anticipation surrounding the announcements, said it was as if Detroit released a new line of automobiles only once every four or five years. \"The business is getting bigger, the stakes are getting higher, and there is such a big leap in technology, potentially making the games ever more realistic and involving,\" said Anita Frazier, entertainment industry analyst for NPD Funworld. Microsoft did not disclose the pricing of its new console. Since their introductions, the current Xbox and Sony's PlayStation 2 have dropped in price from $300 to $150 in the United States; Nintendo's GameCube, originally $200, is now $100. When Xbox arrived in 2001, it was heralded as the most powerful of the consoles and had innovations including a built-in hard drive and an Ethernet port for online play. The machine's biggest hits have been the Halo games, published by Microsoft itself; Halo 2, released last fall, has sold 6.3 million copies. Xbox has also developed a following among game developers, who have been drawn to its power. Still, even with 20 million consoles sold, Xbox has been far outdistanced by Sony's PlayStation 2, with sales of 80 million and 70 percent of the world market. While Halo 2's success put Microsoft's games unit in the black for one quarter last year, the Xbox effort has yet to provide sustained profitability. \"Xbox 1 was very much ready, fire, aim,\" said J Allard, corporate vice president at Microsoft and a leading architect of the Xbox effort. \"We had 19 months and a day between the day we approved the project to the day we were on store shelves.\" For the new Xbox project, Mr. Allard said his team had twice that time and aimed at conceiving a \"magical product\" that was so well integrated it would seem the creation of a single mind. In sheer computing power, the new Xbox is capable of a trillion calculations per second, many orders of magnitude above the original Xbox. (The current box depends mainly on a 733-megahertz processor.) The heat generated by all that power will be drawn off by a water-based cooling system, something usually seen only in high-end PC's. It will also include a redesigned wireless game controller. A Web camera, code-named Cyclops, and a TV-like remote control will be optional. Peter Moore, a Microsoft corporate vice president for worldwide sales and marketing, said Xbox 360 would be especially suited for wide-screen high-definition television and Digital Dolby 5.1 multichannel sound, a requirement for all Xbox 360 games. He added that the new console would also be more seamlessly integrated with Xbox Live, the service that connects games and gamers over high-speed Internet connections for multiplayer action. Xbox Live, which has 1.4 million subscribers, will include a new tier that waives the $6 monthly fee. A demonstration of the console's power delivered stunningly realistic scenes that were indistinguishable at some points from live-action video. \"We have to continue to feed that core audience,\" Robert J. Bach, senior vice president and chief Xbox officer at Microsoft, said of the most ardent gamers. \"But part of the challenge of this next generation is how do we cultivate a broader mass audience.\" Part of that strategy, he said, includes designing Xbox 360 to perform a range of nongaming functions suited to the living room, like streaming digital music and pictures, or videoconferencing. In addition to playing DVD's, as the current Xbox does, it can rip songs from CD's onto a 20-gigabyte hard drive -- a hard drive that can be removed, upgraded and interchanged with other 360 consoles. Judging by dozens of Web sites dedicated to interest in next-generation consoles, expectations are soaring that Xbox 360's competitors will also provide vastly improved graphics, sound and game playing. For example, it is widely believed that Sony's PlayStation 3, which will use a new cell processor technology, will be the most powerful. Molly Smith, a Sony spokeswoman, would not discuss hardware specifics of the PlayStation 3. But she did say that it would be able to deliver \"a quantum leap\" in gaming and electronic entertainment. Nintendo, struggling to shed an image that its technologies mostly appeal to children, is preparing to deliver a game console that is radically different from the cute and cuddly GameCube. Perrin Kaplan, Nintendo's vice president for corporate affairs, said GameCube's successor would be \"very, very sleek.\" She described it as horizontal and no taller than a stack of three DVD cases. Unlike GameCube, the new system will play DVD's, Ms. Kaplin said, and will feature a wireless controller. It will play GameCube games as well as a new class of high-definition games, with new emphasis on online play. Microsoft would not say whether games for the current Xbox would play on Xbox 360. Some industry analysts and game developers said it was likely that games for all three consoles would increase to $60 or $65; the typical price for premium titles on the current machines is $50. \"Over all, the introduction of the next-generation systems will have a very positive impact on the video game industry,\" said Will Kassoy, vice president for global brand management at Activision, a game publisher. \"They will expand the user base and grow software sales.\" Historically, he said, each new cycle of consoles has ushered in a 30 percent rise in the number of players. \"We believe this next generation will see similar growth,\" Mr. Kassoy said. Activision is scheduled to have four games for Xbox 360 at the start, including some of the company's best-selling series -- Tony Hawk, Call to Duty and Quake. Simon Jeffery, president of Sega, said his company would have two titles for Xbox 360 for the holiday season -- Condemned: Criminal Origins and Full Auto -- emphasizing that they will take advantage of the new console's increased power. \"Every successive jump in technology affords new elements of games,\" he said. \"We now will have processing power to do things we haven't been able to do before.\""

                "Sending voice and Webcam picture messages to fellow Xbox 360 players over Microsoft’s Xbox Live service is a cinch, but tapping out old-fashioned text messages using the 360’s onscreen keyboard isn’t much fun. A new $30 miniature keyboard called the Chatpad speeds up text entry to let you best even the fastest BlackBerry touch-typists.  The Chatpad, to go on sale Sept. 6, attaches to the underside of the 360’s controller without interfering with the controller’s comfortable feel in the hands. A backlight makes typing during late-night Gears of War campaigns easier on the eyes, and a dedicated Messenger button activates the 360’s instant messaging program so you can taunt your enemies without breaking from the action. Unfortunately you can’t use the keyboard to type a letter and jump to the corresponding spot in long lists of Xbox Live movie downloads or songs stored on an iPod connected to the 360. Instead, you need to hold down the scroll button. Albert Penello, director for global marketing for Xbox, said the company was looking into a way to add this feature. "

                "FORGET horsepower, forget miles per gallon: the key metric for judging the Nissan Urge, a design study to be introduced today at the North American International Automobile Show in Detroit, is polygons per second, an index of performance for video games. Five hundred million polygons a second is the rating for the Microsoft Xbox 360 video game system tucked away in the car's trunk. It pumps out images fast enough to generate dizzyingly sharp scenes of city streets and speeding cars on a display that folds down from above the windshield. The Urge's key trick is that when parked, its steering wheel and pedals can be used to control the Xbox. The game's soundtrack of roaring engines and screeching tires play through the car's speakers to accompany the action on the screen. Many cars have had video game displays installed in their dashboards. The Urge is the first car to be turned into a game controller -- the tail is now wagging the dog. The Urge, created at Nissan Design America in the La Jolla section of San Diego, is another of the auto industry's seemingly endless quests for \"echo boomer\" customers, a coterie that for carmakers gleams over the horizon the way the mythical city of Eldorado did for the conquistadors. In part, the Urge is a response to an online survey, said John Cupit, a design manager for Nissan. Mr. Cupit interpreted the survey results in the bare, exposed look of the Urge, an articulation of the car's parts aimed, he said, at giving the feel of a motorcycle. The fenders and structure, mostly aluminum, stand out as separate parts. The engine -- a piece of the car so unimportant in this case that Nissan did not even provide the usual specifications of horsepower and torque -- is visible beneath a transparent hood. Nissan calls the look \"minimalism to the maximum.\" The bottoms of the doors are cut away, revealing a surrounding frame of aluminum rendered in \"acid yellow,\" which Anka Mazzei, the color designer, said she chose to express intensity and speed. The front end of the Urge is similar to the GT-R Proto, a concept that Nissan unveiled at the Tokyo auto show last fall. But one should not take the exterior of the Urge too literally. Its weirdness signals that it is unlikely to become a production vehicle. What counts is the concept. Urge is an implicit response to cultural change: young buyers have proved more fascinated by the innovations of their new cellphones, hand-held devices and video games than by the automotive advances that captivated their parents. The showcase game for the Xbox 360 is a special edition of Project Gotham Racing, one of the hit titles for the original Xbox as well. Mr. Cupit said that he and his colleagues at the La Jolla studio spend a lot of time playing on a huge plasma screen. The project was a joint effort with Microsoft, so the Xbox 360 beneath the boattail- shape trunk, one of a half-million consoles shipped since the game system went on sale Nov. 22, is different from the others: no one stood in line to buy it. Video gaming is not the only technology incorporated into the Urge. In addition to the Xbox 360, there is an iPod docking station and a cellphone that doubles as a \"smart key\" to start the engine. In at least one respect, the Urge might be the perfect car: it burns no gasoline while parked for game playing; it generates no emissions; it lines up in no traffic jams. It can virtually roll through the streets of Las Vegas or spin around the Nürburgring. Its version of Gotham Racing can even run uptown on the parts of Broadway that are one-way heading downtown, a special thrill for Manhattan drivers. With a wireless connection, in theory, two Urges could be parked side-by-side for competition like the old racing games at the arcade in Atlantic City. Thanks to the Internet, the same thing could be done even if the Urges were half a world apart. The game encourages stylish driving. Good driving through the curves earns the driver style points, called Kudos, that can be redeemed for a better vehicle. According to the Microsoft programmers, power sliding, pulling off a 360-degree spin, getting air time, drafting and getting up on two wheels \"will earn gamers Kudos points for their style and skill.\" Too bad the real automotive world doesn't work this way. Each car in the game is made up of 80,000 polygons and takes eight days of programming by its creators, who are holed up in the London studio of Bizarre Creations. Real-world details include gauges that move and realistic bug-smash streaks on the windshield. Oddly, the Urge itself is not among the cars you can drive on the screen. That will probably be remedied soon. Project Gotham players and programmers regularly produce new cars that can be downloaded. The Urge's notion of car-as-video game is not unprecedented. A similar concept, the Scion Speedster -- a red Scion xA show car built by 5 Axis Productions in Huntington Beach, Calif. -- was displayed at the Specialty Equipment Market Association trade show in Las Vegas last fall. The Speedster also has an open panel in the doors -- and two Xboxes running the Forza racing game onboard. The two cars simply evolved at the same time, Mr. Cupit said. He prefers his version of the idea. \"We tried to take seriously designing the door glass to protect the occupants from wind and rain, and also vehicle ingress-egress,\" he said. \"Our door moves up and down to ease entry into the car, for example.\" \"We often visit tuner and customizing shows to see what young people are thinking about,\" Mr. Cupit said. \"The Urge helps reinvent the sports car for the next generation of young people.\" Observing young people at auto shows, it is impossible not to note that they pay more attention to how their cars look and sound than how fast they go. The investment tends to go into electronics and colorful bolt-on parts, rather than into making the engine run faster and more furious. Maybe more automakers should put Xboxes in their cars. General Motors and Ford might stir up interest by tucking Xbox 360's into all their trunks."

                "REDMOND, Wash. — Microsoft is betting it has a new way to win the wallets of consumers. The company on Tuesday introduced the new version of its Xbox video game console. The Xbox has been one of Microsoft’s few undeniable consumer hits of the last decade, a product that was not just a credible entry into the games business but also a sign of the innovation possible at a company that is rarely seen as an inventive thinker. “I think of Xbox as the accidental success out of Microsoft,” said James McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester Research, who added that the connection Microsoft has formed with the players of its current Xbox is “much deeper than any relationship Microsoft has ever achieved before.”  The new console, the Xbox One, will enter a market very different from the one its predecessor, the Xbox 360, entered nearly eight years ago, when there was no iPad, smartphones had keyboards and mobile gaming devices were primitive at best.  Today, video games can be played almost anywhere, on any device, with the biggest possible audience of online friends and without the aid of a costly gaming console. The last year or two has been bumpy for Microsoft’s consumer efforts. The Windows 8 operating system software and the Surface tablet-computing devices got a tepid reception from the public when they went on sale last fall.  The company’s mobile phone efforts have been largely ignored. And even Bing, Microsoft’s Internet search engine, has failed to close a wide gap with Google, the market leader.  Microsoft, though, could see better results with the Xbox. With it, it hopes it can reassert the living room as the place where people can still get the best gaming experience, complete with eye-popping graphics and innovative methods for controlling games. It is also a place where Microsoft’s technology can be at the center of a home entertainment system and the funnel through which people gain access to online video. Microsoft has sold more than 76 million of the device’s current incarnation, the Xbox 360 worldwide, compared with almost 100 million Wii consoles from Nintendo and more than 70 million PlayStation 3s from Sony.  The company also controls what may be the most valuable asset in console gaming, Xbox Live, a subscription-based online service with 48 million members who use it to play games against one another and watch movies.  “You can do a lot of things on the phone and a lot of things on tablets,” said John Taylor, an analyst at Arcadia Investment. But, he said, “you can’t do the same kinds of things on those devices” that you can on a television screen. Microsoft plans to develop its own original, live-action television series, which will be accessible through the Xbox. The series will be made in partnership with the director Steven Spielberg and will be based on the popular Halo video game franchise.  The company is also working with the National Football League to develop an app for Xbox that lets players interact with their fantasy football teams while watching a live game. In an interview, Don A. Mattrick, the president of Microsoft’s interactive entertainment business, said that he recognized the growing appeal of mobile devices for gaming and that Microsoft would aggressively tie smartphones and tablets into the experience of using its console. He became most animated when talking about the possibilities of the new Xbox for providers of video programming. “We’re going to the take the form from a one-way experience pushed through a straw to where you can communicate back and make it interactive,” Mr. Mattrick said.  Even if it is a wild success, the new Xbox is likely to have a bigger impact on consumer perception than it will on Microsoft’s overall sales. The Xbox remains a small slice of the company’s business, which is still dominated by sales of Windows, Office and other software. The company’s games division represented only 4 percent of its operating profit. At an event in a carnival tent on its corporate campus, Microsoft did not say how much the new system would cost or how publishing partners would charge for games, which typically start at around $60 for high-end game consoles.  A major feature of the new Xbox, which is expected to hit store shelves in time for the holiday season, will be a new generation of Kinect, the camera-based motion-control sensor introduced several years ago as an Xbox 360 accessory. The new Kinect will come with every Xbox One. Traditional retail sales of games have come under pressure in recent years as mobile devices like the iPhone and iPad have invaded their turf with free and low-cost games. While many gamers dismiss those offerings as inferior to console games, the games have nevertheless tapped into a huge audience of players who may never have played on an Xbox or Sony’s PlayStation. The games business could use a jolt. Total United States retail sales of game hardware and software fell 25 percent to $495.2 million in April from $657.5 million a year earlier, according to estimates by NPD Group, a research firm. That figure does not include the sale of downloadable content over the Internet. Alex St. John, an entrepreneur who worked on Microsoft’s pre-Xbox game efforts, says he is pessimistic about prospects for gaming consoles. “They’re coming out with the latest and greatest stone tool,” Mr. St. John said. “The new console that trumps the old console is called the Apple iPad. This generation of kids loves mobile games.”"

                "Three months after surprising the video game industry with strong sales of its first console, the Microsoft Corporation will dispatch its chairman, Bill Gates, to Tokyo this week to introduce its assault on an inhospitable Japanese market. Not since the industry's early days, when Atari competed for space in video arcades, has a major American game company tried to dethrone Japanese hardware makers on their own turf. When it begins selling its Xbox game system in Japan on Friday, Microsoft will try to use the star power of Mr. Gates and a lineup of specialized games to battle the leaders, Sony and Nintendo. Many industry insiders predict that the Xbox, which has sold more than 1.5 million units in North America since November, will face tough going in Japan, where American software companies have found tremendous difficulties merely putting their games onto store shelves. ''You are talking about a closed market and going up against two very strong, very entrenched competitors,'' said Heath A. Terry, a game software analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston. ''For Microsoft to expect significant success early on in that market is unrealistic.'' The Xbox has other strikes against it for Japanese consumers, who buy about a third of the world's game products. Analysts worry that the console is too big for the living room in a country where smaller gadgets rule. And at about $260, the Xbox costs $40 more than Sony's PlayStation2 and $75 more than Nintendo's GameCube. Yet analysts and software makers acknowledge that Microsoft, the world's No. 1 software company, managed the North American rollout of the Xbox better than they had expected. They also noted that it has deep pockets and has shown unflagging persistence in entering other businesses. The company has already made one significant adjustment specifically for Japan: after criticism from early testers, it built smaller game controllers, with buttons closer together, to better fit the hands of the average Japanese player. Peter Moore, president and chief operating officer for Sega of America, the American division of the Japanese games publisher, said Microsoft's early success in North America gave the company a fighting chance in Japan and Europe, where the Xbox goes on sale on March 14. ''It's eerily reminiscent of the power of the launch of the PlayStation,'' he said, referring to Sony's first console. ''The way a powerful global company can attack an industry, get under its skin and change an industry.'' Hirohisa Ohura, who runs Microsoft's Xbox division in Japan, said the North American introduction had proved that the company could compete in the video game business. While calling Japan ''the most challenging market'' for the Xbox, he said Microsoft would keep chipping away at its competitors for the loyalty of Japanese game players. ''U.S. companies coming into Japan as a game vendor tended to fail and walk away real quick,'' Mr. Ohura said. ''We're not willing to give up at any point. Once we're in this business, we're in here to win.'' In its quest for the buzz that makes or breaks video games, Microsoft set up hundreds of Xbox kiosks in Tokyo and Osaka earlier this month. And for the introduction on Friday, Mr. Gates himself will stump for the Xbox at an event similar to his appearance last November at the opening of the Toys ''R'' Us store in Times Square. Microsoft began taking advance orders on Feb. 2 for consoles, including 50,000 special edition systems with a translucent case and a silver-plated key chain engraved with the autograph of Mr. Gates -- an accessory that has been mocked on online message boards and game publications. Sony, the consumer electronics giant, has an enormous head start on Microsoft. By Dec. 31, Sony said, it had shipped 25 million of its next-generation consoles, the PlayStation2, including 10 million to North America and 8 million to Japan. ''The burden isn't on our company to compete with them; the burden is significantly on Microsoft to compete with us,'' said Molly Smith, a spokeswoman for Sony Computer Entertainment America, the company's American division. The list of best-selling software is dominated by titles that run on the PlayStation2. Yet while they have capitalized on Sony's success in North America, large American game publishers have found the Japanese market difficult to penetrate and have been forced to cooperate with Japanese publishers to develop games specifically for Japan and have games sold there. Electronic Arts is the No. 1 publisher of PlayStation2 titles in North America, but only No. 7 in Japan. ''The secret in Japan is getting product that's culturally appealing to Japanese consumers,'' said Stan McKee, chief financial officer of Electronic Arts. Microsoft has forged partnerships of its own with more than 90 Japanese publishers, but still faces an uphill battle. Because of Sony's lead, analysts said, Microsoft will consider its introduction a success if it wins close to 20 percent of the Japanese market."

                "Reaching out to millions of aspiring game developers around the world, Microsoft plans today to announce a contest that will award $10,000 and the opportunity to entice millions of eyeballs to the next great digital diversion for the company’s Xbox 360. In addition to the game console’s snazzy graphics, the Xbox Live online service has been the most important component of the Xbox 360’s success since its debut in 2005. And perhaps the most popular aspect of Xbox Live has been the service’s arcade component, which allows users to download and play smaller, relatively simpler games like Uno and Geometry Wars that usually cost less than $10. (By contrast, top-end games can sell in stores for around $60.) The popularity of Xbox Live Arcade has in turn attracted the attention of game developers looking to create the next Tetris or Minesweeper. Late last year, Microsoft introduced a suite of software tools for making so-called casual games called XNA.  And so at a game makers’ convention in San Francisco, Microsoft plans to announce a contest akin to the television show “Project Greenlight” that will award a cash prize and a potential slot on Xbox Live Arcade to the best new game created with XNA tools. The company intends to announce the winner of the contest, called “Dream-Build-Play,” in August.  “This competition highlights the power of XNA and the popularity of the Xbox Live Arcade service with its millions of users,” Aaron Greenberg, Microsoft’s group product manager for the Xbox 360 and Xbox Live, said in a telephone interview.  To help increase the popularity of casual games, Microsoft will also announce the introduction of a new 512-megabyte portable storage device for the Xbox 360. The previous portable storage unit contained only 64 megabytes of data, and so Xbox Live Arcade games had been limited to an official size of 50 megabytes. With the new unit, Microsoft will also raise the official size limit on Xbox Live Arcade games to 150 megabytes, allowing enhanced graphics, sound and artificial intelligence. SETH SCHIESEL"

                "Raising the ante in the video game wars, Microsoft is bringing out a new version of the Xbox 360 game machine that has a bigger hard drive, better high-definition video support and a stylish black finish, not an insignificant feature in a world where looking cool ranks high. The idea is to appeal to an elite class of hardcore game players who would like a little more of everything.   “Today’s games-and-entertainment enthusiast has an insatiable appetite for digital high-definition content,” said Peter Moore, corporate vice president for Microsoft’s interactive entertainment business, in Redmond, Wash.   The Xbox 360 Elite, which is to be announced today and will be in stores in late April, will have a list price of $479, or $80 more than the Xbox 360 Pro and $180 more than the basic Xbox 360. The new model has a 120-gigabyte hard drive, in contrast to the standard model’s 20-gigabyte drive. It also has a high-definition multimedia interface port and cable and a wireless controller and headset. Current Xbox 360 owners can buy the new 120-gigabyte hard drive as a separate accessory for $179.  Microsoft is clearly hoping to fill what it sees as a hole at the top end of the market. The Nintendo Wii has been outselling the PlayStation 3 from Sony and the Xbox 360 in recent months, but that system is largely positioned as a family-friendly game machine that can be purchased for $50 less than the lowest-priced Xbox. The Sony system is priced higher than both the Nintendo and the Microsoft systems, with the cheapest model priced at $499.  Both Microsoft and Sony have positioned their consoles as entertainment hubs, not just for playing sophisticated video games but also for listening to music and viewing downloaded movies and television shows.   John Rodman, group product manager for the Xbox platform and Xbox Live, pointed to a recent Microsoft survey that revealed that nearly 40 percent of the time that Xbox 360 users spent with their consoles was for activities other than gaming.   Yet when it comes to gaming, Xbox 360 users are serious, Mr. Rodman says. Six out of 10 Xbox 360 users use Xbox Live, Microsoft’s online gaming service.   “We don’t feel like the Wii customer and the Xbox customer are the same thing,” he said. “We think that as soon as the Wii customer turns 14 they want something else.”  James L. McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester Research, said that Microsoft hoped to encourage customers to spend more money downloading movies and games, which require considerable hard-drive space. "

                "LOS ANGELES  Reaching out beyond hardcore video game players to everyday consumers, Microsoft outlined an entertainment strategy on Monday for making the company’s Xbox 360 game console a gateway for movies, television and social networking. In a media presentation on the eve of E3, the video game industry’s biggest North American convention, Microsoft announced new relationships with the social networking giants Facebook and Twitter as well as Sky, the big British satellite television provider that is a unit of the News Corporation.  Microsoft announced that Facebook users would be able to access their profiles and share photos on their television through the Xbox Live network and that Twitter devotees would also be able to post and read messages through the service.  More far-reaching was Microsoft’s new deal with Sky, under which Xbox Live users in Britain will be able to watch live television, including professional soccer, over an Internet version of the Sky service. Not every channel available over satellite will be available over Xbox Live, but the offering will include dozens of stations, Microsoft executives said. Users will be able to watch television in a virtual party room with their friends, discussing the program as they are watching, they said.  Microsoft has long sought a bigger role in home television, going so far in years past as to try to build its own set-top box business. Partnering with Sky represents a back door into the television market. The company has also recognized how Nintendo has expanded the traditional audience for video games with its innovative motion-sensitive controller for the Wii. Microsoft provided the first public demonstration of its futuristic Project Natal, which it hopes will usher in an age of completely controller-free gaming.  Using a sophisticated camera, infrared sensors and voice recognition software, Natal allows users to control a game or other programs, like a virtual painting studio, merely by waving their arms, speaking to the system and moving around. Microsoft did not say when the technology would become available. Microsoft also demonstrated some of its coming big games, including Forza Motorsport 3, the suspense-thriller Alan Wake and a new version of its biggest hit, Halo. Hideo Kojima, the developer behind the Metal Gear series, said that the next major installment in that franchise would be available for Xbox 360, a coup for Microsoft because previous Metal Gear games had been exclusive to Sony game machines."

                " NEW YORK — Buyers of the Xbox 360, Microsoft's second-generation video game console, will expect to play big, expensive marquee games like \"Call of Duty 2\" from Activision and \"Madden NFL 06\" by Electronic Arts. But Microsoft is also banking on them to play small arcade-style video games, purchased and downloaded from the Internet. Unlike its competitors, the Sony PlayStation 2 and Nintendo GameCube, the new Xbox, which goes on sale on Nov. 22, can play games on two separate tracks. One is the familiar terrain of big-budget, deeply immersive games that feel more like interactive movies than games. The other is a return to the video game's arcade roots. But the arcade games are not simple, said Greg Canessa, group manager of Xbox Live Arcade, part of the Xbox division.\"Arcade games are really miniature Xbox 360 games,\" he said. The price is somewhat miniaturized as well. To develop the arcade games cost $100,000 to $200,000, compared with $15 million to $20 million for the larger games. The arcade games will be sold only online, downloadable through the Xbox's broadband-only Internet connection. Microsoft has not officially announced prices for the games, but it is widely expected that they will cost $5 to $10. By contrast, new Xbox games sold at retailers like Best Buy are likely to cost $60, or about $10 more than previous Xbox games, according to some game publishers. The new machines, slimmer and more powerful than the original Xbox released in 2001, will cost $300 for a basic model and $400 for a model with a 20-gigabyte hard drive. They will also be able to play DVDs, CDs and standard music files, including MP3 and Windows Media Audio files, as well as display digital snapshots on a TV screen. Those functions and the arcade-type gaming feature are central to Microsoft's strategy to reach a broader family market, beyond the young male players who have been the Xbox's primary audience.To do that, Peter Moore, vice president for marketing at Xbox International, said Microsoft would eliminate the need for credit cards in making online purchases of games, accessories and upgrades. Instead of credit cards, the Xbox Live online service will accept Microsoft value cards that can be bought in various denominations online or at retail and convenience stores, Moore said. The value cards would function, in effect, like tokens in an arcade. \"We have to get credit cards out of the way,\" he said. \"We've got to broaden this to younger demographics.\" Another big selling point for the 360 is its enhanced Internet connectivity through the Xbox Live service.Microsoft will give Xbox 360 owners a free subscription to Xbox Live Silver, which gives players access to the online system's features, including the ability to buy and download games. A Gold membership, at $50 a year, permits users to play games with others over the Internet. Canessa, the group manager of Xbox Live Arcade, said that each arcade game could play at 1080i high definition and that most could take advantage of the 360's ability to communicate with other players over a broadband Internet connection. \"We will have from 12 to 15 games by launch,\" Canessa said. At least 75 percent, he added, will be capable of being played live online by more than one player.Each Xbox 360, he said, will include a free copy of the full version of \"Hexic HD,\" an arcade-style puzzle game developed by Alexey Pajitnov, the creator of \"Tetris.\" \"We created a whole market, a whole new world, for downloadable games,\" Canessa said. While online arcade games have proved popular on personal computers, Canessa said he believed that the 360's embrace of arcade games would further invigorate independent game design. \"The indie game developers is one of the opportunities I'm most excited about,\" he said. \"You have small, independent, three guys in a garage making games, totally innovating. It's the Sundance Film Festival, if you will, of games.\" "

                " SEATTLE — In a bid to make its games unit profitable by 2007, Microsoft is planning to start selling a more expensive version of its Xbox game console this autumn. The premium Xbox 360 console will sell for $399.99 in the United States, nearly three times the price of the current Xbox, according to an announcement made by Microsoft on Wednesday. The premium console will sell for399.99, or $490.67, in Continental Europe, while its scaled-back version, called \"Xbox 360 Core System,\" will sell for $299.99 in the United States and299.99 in Europe. Microsoft is counting on the new releases of its console to make its video game unit profitable by 2007, according to Robert Bach, senior vice president for Microsoft's home and entertainment division. The game unit of Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, has lost $2.8 billion in the last three years, while Sony's rival console, the PlayStation, is profitable. Bach predicted that the Xbox 360 would outsell Sony's PlayStation 3, which is scheduled for release next year, even though the PlayStation 2 has outsold the Xbox by nearly 4 to 1. Various Xbox accessories, like a 20-gigabyte detachable hard drive and a wireless controller that will be delivered with the premium version of the console, will also be available for purchase as an add-on for the less expensive \"core\" console. Microsoft is also planning to sell other Xbox accessories, like a wireless controller and TV remote, a headset for the Xbox Live online service and an Ethernet cable for high-speed Internet connections. The company said that it remained on target to ship the new Xbox to stores in North America, Europe and Japan in time for the upcoming holiday season, ahead of Sony's PlayStation 3, which is slated to replace the PlayStation 2 in the spring. Bach noted that both new versions of the Xbox would support high-definition visuals and play music and movies. These features were not part of the original Xbox release, which cost $299 four years ago but now sells for $150. Matt Rosoff, an analyst at the independent research firm Directions on Microsoft, said he doubted that enthusiasts would balk at the price increase for the new releases.\"Hard-core gamers will be on board,\" Rosoff said. \"I think the sticker shock might be in the larger audience Microsoft is trying to reach,\" like casual game players and neophytes, he added. Microsoft sells its current Xbox console at a loss because its primary goal was to break into the lucrative game market. It makes money selling games, but does not expect its home and entertainment division to post profits regularly until 2007. \"They need to not lose a lot of money on the console this time,\" said Ben Bajarin, an analyst at Creative Strategies in Campbell, California. \"They'd like to get closer to a small margin of profit on the console.\" The core console will not be able to play games designed for the original Xbox unless a consumer spends $99.99 to add a hard drive. Microsoft has asked developers working on future games to make them in such a way that they could be played on both the fully loaded and basic versions of the console. Pricing for the new Xbox in Japan, where Microsoft sells just a few hundred consoles a week, will not be announced until the Tokyo Game Show in September, Bach said. "

                " SAN JOSE, California — The tit-for- tat battle for customers between Sony and Microsoft continued Thursday as the Japanese electronics group announced plans to introduce an online gaming service when its PlayStation 3 video game console is released in the fall. The news of the service, which lets users buy games and communicate and compete with other players via the Web, comes days after Tokyo-based Sony said that it would delay the release of its next-generation PlayStationconsole until November, putting it a year behind Microsoft's popular Xbox 360. The much-awaited start had originally been scheduled for the spring and the news, on March 15, prompted Microsoft to announce this week that it was more than doubling shipments of the Xbox 360. Phil Harrison, president of worldwide studios for Sony Computer Entertainment, said that the basic level of Sony's online service, known internally as PlayStation Network Platform, would be free, and would allow users to play against each other online, e-mail and chat with friends. Additional game services and premium content will be made available to users who pay a subscription fee, Harrison said. Sony, one of the world's leading technology manufacturers and entertainment companies, is hoping to retain its dominance over the roughly $30 billion global video game market with the PS3. Microsoft introduced the Xbox 360 game console in November. The company's Xbox Live subscription service, which offers game downloads and online play, has been a hit on the new machine and Sony had been widely expected to offer a similar service. Built in collaboration with Sony Online Entertainment, which already offers PC game downloads and a marketplace for trading virtual assets, the service was inspired by businesses like the online auction site eBay and the online retailer Amazon.com, where communities of users contribute ratings and recommendations. It also steals a page from social networking sites like Myspace.com, which has attracted millions of users. \"We have to fall into step with consumer expectations,\" said Harrison, who said the social aspects of the network promise to get people more involved in gaming. With broadband adoption on the rise and television viewership dropping, advertisers are exploring the possibility of buying ad space in games much like they now do on the Web. \"This can provide a tremendous revenue stream for our industry,\" Harrison said. Video game makers, which have seen sales fall as gamers wait and save for new consoles, have been under pressure to find new ways to offset rising game development costs. Microsoft said Tuesday that Xbox Live had logged more than 10 million downloads.More than 85 percent of Xbox 360 consoles that are connected to the Internet have downloaded games, trailers and videos from the subscription service, Microsoft said. Downloads appeal to many game makers, because they can cut costs by selling direct to consumers. Online distribution also gives them a way to head off piracy and used game sales by providing a way to check that the player of a game is also its owner. Anita Frazier, an analyst with NPD Group, a market research company, said most publishers were \"treading lightly\" into direct online sales of games because they do not want to alienate retailers, but added that such services would likely open the market for more games.$@ "

                "Executives at Microsoft are fond of saying that its subscription gaming service, Xbox Live, should be thought of as a cable channel. They want Xbox to be seen not merely as a gaming machine for teenagers, but as a media portal for parents and grandparents, too. The company is even producing shows for users: it is in the middle of the second season of “1 vs. 100,” an interactive version of a game show that was on NBC. The content ambitions do not end there. Microsoft has held in-depth talks with the Walt Disney Company about a programming deal with ESPN, according to people close to the talks, who requested anonymity because the talks were intended to be private. For a per-subscriber fee, ESPN could provide live streams of sporting events, similar to the ones available through ESPN 360, a service that is available from some high-speed Internet providers. Microsoft could also create some interactive games in association with ESPN, the people said. One of the people said the deal was not imminent. The companies declined to comment. Already, video game consoles are putting a new emphasis on the video, rather than the game.  The roughly 20 million monthly members of Xbox Live can surf Facebook, browse an online mall of movies and TV episodes and, if they pay, watch Netflix.  “It’s 20 million connected living rooms,” said Marc Whitten, the general manager of Xbox Live. Similarly, users of the Sony PlayStation can tune into BBC shows and see Weather Channel updates, as well as stream Netflix. Last week, Netflix extended its streaming service to the Nintendo Wii.  Among the many companies that want to transport the on-demand qualities of the Internet into the living room  the over-the-top model, in industry parlance  the console makers have a significant head start. Nearly 60 percent of American homes now have at least one console, according to the consulting firm Deloitte, up from 44 percent three years ago. “For both of the big guys, it’s about extending the value of the hardware platform,” said Mike McGuire, a vice president for the research firm Gartner, referring to Microsoft and Sony. “The devices are hooked to TVs and have broadband connections, and there are more and more opportunities to license movies and TV shows and deliver them in over-the-top models.” Microsoft said this month that it had sold 39 million Xbox 360 consoles around the world. About half sign into Xbox Live each month. At that size, “it starts to feel like a cable network,” said Mark Kroese, who oversees Xbox advertising sales for Microsoft. The company does not specify how many members pay for access to premium services like Netflix; basic functions of Xbox Live are free. The company says it regularly counts more than a million concurrent users  and topped out at 2.2 million at one point during Christmas week last month. That compares favorably to some of the top channels on cable, like TBS and the Cartoon Network, which reach about one million viewers at any given time, according to the Nielsen Company.  The comparisons are crude at best because many of Xbox Live’s users are playing games rather than watching video. No third-party measurement exists, because ratings companies like Nielsen do not yet track the service fully. But there is no doubt that consoles are expanding their domain, something that is evident in Mr. Whitten’s vision of the service: “The entertainment you want, the people you care about, wherever you are.” The addition of Netflix in late 2008 was an important step into the entertainment arena for Xbox, and perhaps a precursor to Microsoft’s current talks with Hollywood producers. Without releasing specific numbers, Mr. Whitten said the streaming movies and TV service were “very, very popular,” including in his own household. Mr. Whitten said Microsoft wanted to be a bigger player in television and film viewing. He declined to comment on the conversations with Disney but said more than once that “there’s going to be a ton of experimentation around business models and rights.” “Our goal is, really, how can we get as much content there as possible,” he said. Disney is not alone in showing an interest in the console market. Many companies sell TV episodes and film rentals through Microsoft’s online store, and Web video ventures are clamoring to have a place on the service. Console makers have a long way to go to be considered replacements for cable subscriptions, but, at the very least, they could put a dent in the time spent viewing traditional TV. The interactive game show “1 vs. 100” drew well over 100,000 concurrent users at times during its first season last year, according to Microsoft’s internal data. During the second season, which began in November, two-hour TV-style trivia competitions are scheduled on Tuesday and Friday nights. A voice-over announcer, shown onscreen as an avatar, provides live color commentary. Like the defunct NBC show, the game has a contestant, “The One,” and a “Mob” of 100 other players. Members of the audience can watch passively or play along, improving their odds of being picked to play for prizes. Unlike on the live-action TV show, every player on Xbox is represented by a cartoonish avatar. Dave McCarthy, a general manager at Microsoft Game Studios, said the scheduled TV-style shows provided a guarantee that “you’re a part of something bigger.” Beyond the game show realm, Microsoft also exclusively shows “The Guild,” a sitcom that it bills as “Seinfeld” meets video game culture. It stars its creator, the actress Felicia Day, and is sponsored by Sprint. For advertisers like Sprint, online communities like Xbox Live are another arena to pursue consumers. Within “1 vs. 100” there are 15- and 30-second commercial breaks like on TV. Those spots account for about 15 percent of the service’s advertising revenue; most of the rest comes from ads on Xbox Live navigation pages, like display ads on Web sites.  In November, Nielsen started to track “1 vs. 100” play and ad views. The pilot program “is the tip of the iceberg,” said Gerardo Guzman, a director for Nielsen Games; eventually, he hopes to generate TV-style ratings. Mr. Kroese said Xbox advertisers were “very interested in being able to compare the media buy on Xbox to other media buys they do.” Microsoft says nearly half of Xbox Live members use its entertainment content; the rest mostly play multiplayer games. But it expects that more of its users will try the entertainment side and the line between them will blur further. “I don’t think there’s a real difference between a game and ‘Lost.’ Or a game and ‘American Idol.’ They’re all ways we spend our leisure time,” Mr. Whitten said.  Over time, he predicted, “these narrow swim lanes  games, music, movies, etc.  will dissolve.”"

                "LOS ANGELES, July 5 — In what may be one of the costliest consumer warranty repairs in history, Microsoft announced on Thursday that it would spend up to $1.15 billion to repair failing Xbox 360 game machine consoles. While the company would not say how many units were failing, Robbie Bach, president of Microsoft’s entertainment and devices division, said that there have been an “unacceptable high number of repairs.” The majority of Xbox 360 owners, he said, have not experienced hardware failure.  Company officials said that Microsoft had sold 11.6 million Xbox 360 units by the end of June, shy of the 12 million units the company had predicted. The Xbox 360, which first went of sale in November 2005, is currently the best-selling game machine in the United States, according to NPD, a market research firm. The size of the anticipated repair bill suggests that a third to as many as half of the machines are flawed.  Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., said it would take a charge of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion against earnings in the quarter ended June 30. Consumers know they have a problem if three red flashing lights appear on the console. Gamers on online forums have been referring to the event as “the Red Ring of Death” because the machine then shuts down.  The company declined to explain the nature of the failure, but said that it was not caused by a single problem in the console, which it said contained 1,700 components and 500 million transistors. The company also said there were no health or safety concerns involved. The problem began to appear over the last three to four months, Mr. Bach said, after “significant usage” of the consoles. He said the company has taken steps to correct the problem in new devices. Microsoft said it would extend the warranty of the game console to three years to customers worldwide. Previously, products sold in the United States were covered by a one-year warranty, while Xbox 360 units sold in Europe had a two-year warranty.  In addition, customers who have had their consoles repaired because of the “three flashing lights” problem will be reimbursed for the cost of the repairs. Microsoft has succeeded in establishing the Xbox brand against the better known Sony PlayStation and other game machines. The Xbox and its successor, the Xbox 360, was the software maker’s first major foray into hardware. Although sales are small relative to the rest of Microsoft’s revenue, the Xbox has been an important venture for the company and was viewed by many analysts as Microsoft’s attempt to compete with the likes of Sony and Apple for control of electronics and entertainment within homes.  The device can be used to access the Internet and view movies. Microsoft said its entertainment and devices division reported an operating loss of $315 million on $929 million in revenue for the three-month period that ended in March, and analysts have estimated that the company lost about $6 billion getting a foothold in the game machine industry.  A new Xbox 360 with a 20-gigabyte hard drive sells for about $400, but other versions cost about $300.  The announcement comes on the eve of the E3 Media and Business Summit, the video-game industry’s major trade show, to be held next week in Los Angeles. “This is bound to affect discussions between Microsoft and its developers and retailers,” said Richard Doherty, a partner in the research company Envisioneering Group."

                "One of the enduring attractions of comic books and graphic novels is the ease with which they explain the universe. Evil is identifiable, external and fairly simple to vanquish with the application of the appropriate superpowers. And sometimes, as in the case of ABC Family’s new comic-based series “The Middleman,” evil is downright funny. In “Middleman’s” first episode, last week, a slimy, many-eyed, multitentacled creature erupts in a DNA lab. Later, evil’s personification is a mobster ape with a machine gun. These over-the-top creatures are more comic than threatening. Usually the phrase “cartoonish violence” is a pejorative; here it’s a compliment. “The Middleman,” written as a graphic novel by Javier Grillo-Marxuach, who has also written for the series “Lost” and “Medium,” stars Matt Keeslar in the title role, a straight-arrow, milk-drinking former member of the Navy Seals who stands between us and horrors we’re not even aware of, fighting evil “so you don’t have to.” He dresses like a Canadian Mountie and delivers his lines with the stone-face confidence of a young Peter Graves. Early on, he explains the world to his protégée. “You know how in comic books there’s all kinds of mad scientists and aliens and androids and monsters who want to either take over or destroy the world?” he asks. “Well, it really does work like that.” This is news to Wendy Watson (Natalie Morales), an art-school graduate and temp secretary whose calm in the face of the multitentacled slime creature  she stabs it with a letter opener  inspires the Middleman to recruit her. “You’re good under pressure,” he says. She asks, “Are you hitting on me?” There is some sexual tension between these two, but you hope it won’t become a big part of the story; there’s much more interesting material here. “Middleman” is full of hilarious throwaways, as when our hero, preparing to drink a glass of “cool refreshing milk” with some bad guys, empties his pockets  of grenades, flamethrowers and a crossbow.  The genius is in the details. When the Middleman asks Wendy if she has experience with firearms, and she says she’s a pacifist, he looks at her fingers. Their calluses tell him that she is a veteran Xbox player. “You probably have better hand-eye than a bush sniper,” he concludes. “Middleman” skillfully incorporates real-life details into its fantastic scenarios. Its characters aren’t just Manichaean warriors; they also live the kinds of lives that people read comic books to escape from. “Did I get any calls?” Wendy asks her roommate after a rough day at the office. The roommate says: “Yeah. Your mom called to ask if you’re a lesbian.” That would be the mom whom Wendy describes as “on me 24/7 to quit painting, move back to Orlando, meet a good man, eat fried foods, swell up like a tick and start squeezing out calves like Elsie mainlining fertility drugs.” Then there’s the motive of the mad scientist who created the gun-toting ape; she’s just trying to compensate for federal cuts to her research grants. Saving the world is easy; making a world as complex and funny as this one is the real feat of “Middleman.” THE MIDDLEMAN ABC Family, Monday nights at 8, Eastern and Pacific times; 7, Central time. Created by Javier Grillo-Marxuach, based on his Viper Comics graphic novels, with illustrations by Les McClaine; directed by Jeremiah Chechik; Mr. Grillo-Marxuach and John Ziffren, executive producers; Hans Beimler, co-executive producer; Jon Pare, producer; Sarah Watson, co-producer; Mr. Chechik and Tracey Stern, supervising producers.  WITH: Matt Keeslar (the Middleman), Natalie Morales (Wendy Watson), Mary Pat Gleason (Ida), Brit Morgan (Lacey) and Jake Smollett (Noser)."

                "TOKYO, Dec. 16 - In the United States, Microsoft's Xbox 360 video game console has been so popular it is hard to keep on store shelves. But in Tokyo's neon-drenched Akihabara neighborhood, known as Electronics Town, there are plenty of the sleek white machines to go around, if you can find takers. At Yodobashi Camera, an eight-story electronics department store selling everything from hair curlers to home computer servers, a small corner display of Xbox 360's draws little attention from passing shoppers. It is not hard to figure out why. Lined up on a rack near the display are the only nine games sold for Xbox 360. But behind it are some 3,000 games, spread across six store aisles, for Microsoft's biggest rival here, the Sony PlayStation 2. \"Xbox doesn't even have Gran Turismo,\" said Shun'ichi Moriizumi, naming a popular auto racing game. One of the few shoppers to stop in front of the Xbox display, Mr. Moriizumi, a 22-year-old university student, said he came to see the Xbox 360, which went on sale here Dec. 10, 18 days after its debut in the United States. \"I like the graphics,\" he said \"But I'm not going to buy it, at least not today. I'm waiting until the new PlayStation comes out before deciding which to buy.\" That appears to be a common sentiment in Japan, the world's second-largest video game market after the United States. The Xbox 360 had a disappointing opening day in Japan. During the first weekend the Xbox 360 was in stores, Microsoft sold 62,135 of about 159,000 machines shipped, or about 39 percent, according to a Japanese market research company, Enterbrain. That pace was even slower than in 2002, when Microsoft introduced its earlier Xbox model in Japan, where it was considered a flop. Microsoft was hoping to make a bigger splash this time, not just because of the market's size here but also because of Japan's importance as a proving ground for new products. Japan is, after all, home to Microsoft's two biggest rivals in video games, Sony and Nintendo, and its software companies write many of the games played worldwide, from Super Mario Brothers to Final Fantasy. Winning over Japan's finicky consumers, who are known to reject games for seemingly minor shortcomings in performance and appearance, represents a coveted seal of approval, analysts say. So far, Microsoft has failed the test. As of June, the latest data available, 470,000 Xbox machines over all have been sold in Japan, versus 13 million in the United States, according to the market research site Famitsu.com. That gave Xbox a mere 2 percent slice of the 22 million game machines sold in Japan. By contrast, Xbox had a 25 percent share of the 52 million machines sold in the United States, according to Famitsu. Analysts say the biggest hurdle the Xbox 360 faces in Japan is the dominance of Sony and to a lesser extent Nintendo. Sony has 81 percent of the Japanese market; Nintendo has most of the rest, according to Famitsu. Worldwide, PlayStation's market share is about 68 percent; Xbox is in second place with 17 percent and Nintendo has the rest. Microsoft had hoped to steal a march by rolling out its next-generation XBox game machine ahead of its two Japanese rivals. Sony plans to sell its newest game console, PlayStation 3, in the spring, though the company will not say exactly when. Nintendo says it will release its new console, Revolution, in 2006. But Microsoft's strategy does not seem to be working, analysts say. One problem they note is that Microsoft introduced Xbox 360 before there was much game software to play on it. That makes the Xbox 360 less attractive next to the vastly larger number of games available for PlayStation. Microsoft says more games are in the pipeline, including the latest version of the popular Dead or Alive, which is supposed to go on sale here later this month. \"We didn't have a rocket start,\" said Asako Miyata, a spokeswoman in Japan for Microsoft. \"But we see sales steadily picking up as more games become available.\" Analysts say, however, that even when more games appear, Microsoft may have trouble luring first-time buyers because of the need to replace their game software libraries. Because so many consumers now own PlayStation 2, it would be easier for them to wait for the arrival of PlayStation 3, which would be able to play all their current games, . \"Sony has such a high penetration rate,\" said John Yang, an electronics analyst in Tokyo for Standard & Poor's rating agency. \"It is not uncommon for households here to have two or even three PS2's,\" he said, referring to the current PlayStation model. \"Why would an entire household want to switch to Xbox?\" Takashi Sudo, a manager for the video game department at the Yodobashi Camera store, said several hundred people showed up for the opening day of Xbox 360 at his store. But he said he expected a crowd at least five times as large for the PlayStation 3 debut in the spring. For that, he says, he will need to set up a line of special booths to handle the crunch. \"This is Sony's country,\" Mr. Sudo said. \"Xbox has to break into a market that Sony built.\""

                "SANTA MONICA, Calif., July 10 — As Microsoft executives played down the impact of an extensive repair program for defective Xbox 360 game machines, they announced several efforts to broaden the appeal of their machine to families.  Opening the annual E3 game conference here, Microsoft executives announced a deal to distribute films from the Walt Disney Company on Microsoft’s Xbox Live Internet service and outlined a broader array of games focused mostly on children and families.  Executives predicted that the company’s recently announced plan to spend up to $1.15 billion to fix defective Xbox 360 game machine would improve, not undermine, the system’s image with consumers.   “The important impact for us is that our customers know we’re going to support the console and support them and if they have issues, we’ll take care of it,” said Robert J. Bach, president of Microsoft’s entertainment and devices division, in an interview. “It won’t change what’s happening in the marketplace because the industry is about the games and we think we have the games that will get people really excited this year.”  As the game industry’s growth has slowed in recent years, game developers have tried to reach beyond the young male players who have been the target audience.  “We believe we have the best game lineup in video-game history for the holiday season,” said Mr. Bach. “You can look top to bottom and we think we have the goods to please any type of gamer.”  Part of Microsoft’s strategy has been to position the Xbox 360 as a living room media hub and an essential element of that plan has been allowing users to download films and television shows to the machine. Adding Disney to the roster of companies distributing movies and video programming over the Xbox Live service should help broaden the appeal of the game system to families with children. The same could be said of the new games Microsoft announced here, including a new installment of the company’s Viva Pinata game and a version of the Scene It? board game. Scene It? will come with a new controller for the Xbox 360 with large buttons and a simple layout that game novices, intimidated by a traditional game controller, may find easier to use “Part of our strategy is we want to win this generation and in order to do that we have to expand beyond the core gamer audience that we’ve had success with and that means appealing to the broad consumer market,” said Shane Kim, general manager of Microsoft Game Studios. The company also said it was developing a keyboard for the Xbox 360 controller. Currently, Xbox Live users send text messages using an on-screen keyboard. The company recently announced plans to integrate the popular Windows Live Messenger service with Xbox Live.  But even as Microsoft hopes to appeal to new sorts of users, the company wants to avoid neglecting the serious player. So Microsoft also said that the next version of the popular Resident Evil series from Capcom of Japan would also be designed to run on the Xbox 360.   In the past, Resident Evil games have run only on Nintendo and Sony consoles. Persuading Capcom to develop games for the Xbox 360 underlines the success Microsoft has had recently in attracting Japanese developers who had shied away from the American console. "

                "AFTER a 31-year-old Manhattan financial executive received Microsoft's Xbox video game system as a gift in January, he walked to a store and bought a half-dozen game titles. The video game industry would have been pleased to hear it. After he played those games a few times against computer-controlled opponents, he got a bit bored and signed up for Microsoft's Xbox Live service, which enabled him to play against other people online. The video game industry, again, would have been pleased. After a few months on the Xbox Live network, in May, he got a bit bored again. This time, however, he opened his Xbox and soldered in a chip that allowed him to change the console's basic computer code and bypass its internal security technology. After installing a new hard drive, he transferred about 3,000 MP3 music files to the system and downloaded illegal copies of 3,500 old-time arcade games. Then he installed the Linux operating system, which allowed him to use the box essentially as a personal computer. Needless to say, the video game industry would not have been pleased. When Microsoft released the Xbox in November 2001, it was heralded as far more than a game machine. Even as the Xbox took aim at Sony's PlayStation 2 game empire, the console was meant to lead Microsoft's broader invasion of the living room. Incorporating a hard drive, which made it more readily adaptable than other consoles, the Xbox had the potential to be a digital-entertainment nerve center. Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, said at the time, ''We're going to put new software that runs on Xbox that, both in the gaming dimension and other dimensions, will amaze people with the power that's in this box.'' That is happening, but not necessarily as Microsoft planned. All sorts of new software is indeed running on Xbox consoles these days, and they are in fact becoming home-entertainment hubs, but it is not Microsoft doing the amazing. Rather, an online confederacy apparently numbering in the thousands -- including accomplished hackers of varied motives and everyday technophiles like the Manhattan financial executive (who shared his experience on the condition of anonymity) -- is taking the lead. Those involved often call their efforts ''unleashing'' or ''unshackling'' -- freeing the Xbox to express its inner PC. Technology industry executives, however, often call such activity a bald attempt to hijack the Xbox illegally. It is a battle that involves many of the ethical and legal issues facing the technology and media industries at this digital moment. What rights do consumers have to tinker with products they own? How far should companies go to protect their intellectual property? What happens when the desires of consumers conflict with the business models of companies they patronize? Who gets to decide just what a particular product may be used for? The Xbox is a particularly attractive target for hackers because while it is essentially a standard PC modified to do only a few things, like play Xbox games, it is much cheaper than a PC. It is like an economy car modified to follow only a few roads -- but one potentially as powerful as a far more expensive model. In the Xbox, that power comes in the form of a 733-megahertz Intel processor, comparable to a midrange personal computer, and sophisticated graphics and audio systems. Its limited operating system, based on a version of Windows, can be used by a programmer to run simple software like a music player -- or the machine can run a new operating system altogether, namely Linux. ''The reality is that if you could bypass Microsoft's operating system you would end up with a fairly powerful computer for less than $200,'' the Manhattan financial executive said. In fact, Microsoft lowered the price for Xbox to $179.99 in May. In a sense, Xbox hackers are exploiting Microsoft's business model, which is to sell Xbox hardware at a loss (to build penetration of the system) and make the money back on royalties from the sale of Xbox software. A PC manufacturer like Dell, meanwhile, has to recoup its costs and generate a profit from the initial sale. So someone who buys the Xbox hardware, modifies it into a general-purpose computer and does not buy Xbox games potentially undermines not only Microsoft but also the personal computer industry. But that is not how some Xbox hackers think about it. ''Especially in Europe, computers are more expensive than they are here, and the Xbox is the cheapest computer you can get,'' Andrew Huang, author of a new book called ''Hacking the Xbox: An Introduction to Reverse Engineering,'' said in a telephone interview. ''Basically,'' he added by e-mail, ''once you have Linux, you have everything.'' It is unclear just how many Xbox hackers there are. Officials of the Interactive Digital Software Association, a trade group of video game publishers, said that Xbox hacking appeared more prevalent in parts of Asia than in North America. Michael Steil, a 24-year-old German who is project leader of a group that calls itself the Xbox Linux Project, said by e-mail that a full version of Linux software for the Xbox had been downloaded more than 220,000 times. Whatever the numbers, Microsoft does not appear eager to discuss Xbox hacking. In recent weeks, a Microsoft public relations representative repeatedly declined to make any company executives available to discuss the matter. Instead, the company issued a statement through a public relations firm that said in part: ''Microsoft is a company passionate about innovation and creativity. We are also very committed to respect for others' intellectual property and we request the same respect applied to our innovations.'' The statement made no reference to the potential use of hacked Xbox consoles as personal computers, saying Microsoft's ''primary concern'' was with the sale of modified chips for the boxes ''that enable game counterfeiting.'' And that is the area that most clearly raises legal issues. Although there are several methods, hacking an Xbox typically involves obtaining a special chip called a modchip, available on the Internet, and soldering it into the machine. (For those who find the process daunting, there are also vendors on the Internet who sell ''pre-modded'' Xbox units.) Modchips, of which there are several varieties, allow users to load new versions of the basic computer code, known as the BIOS, that tells the machine how to operate. A hacked BIOS generally incorporates modified versions of copyrighted Microsoft code and so is generally illegal. The main Web sites that deal with Xbox hacking do not include links to hacked BIOS, and hackers generally find their forbidden fruit in Internet chat rooms. Once the modchip is installed and the BIOS modified, the console can do a number of things it cannot do ''out of the box.'' Xbox games normally must be run from an optical disk, and a hacked Xbox can ''back up'' a game to the unit's hard drive and run the game without the disk. This technique could be used simply to avoid having to insert and remove disks -- or it could be used for piracy (say, by renting a game, putting the software on the hard drive and returning the game). Until passage of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act in 1998, the mere sale of a modified chip would not have appeared illegal. That law, however, prohibits the sale of devices that are primarily meant to circumvent copyright protection. Companies and technologists will fight over the exact legal meaning of those provisions for years. For now, however, the software industry is relying on them. ''Our view over all on modchips is that they are illegal infringing devices, that where we find people engaged in the widespread manufacturing and distribution of them, we and our members, individually and collectively, are committed to doing what we can to shut down their manufacturing and go after the distributors,'' said Doug Lowenstein, president of the Interactive Digital Software Association. Some advocates, however, say that while software piracy is illegal and morally offensive, the mere act of modifying hardware should not be illegal. ''The most important dimension of this debate from our view is that people should have the right to tinker with the stuff that they own,'' said Fred von Lohmann, senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a civil-liberties group in San Francisco. ''Others will say that this is about piracy and all that, but they forget that the principle of tinkering with the stuff that you own was the principle on which the entire personal computer industry was founded,'' he added. ''This is basic business and basic science in the technology world and we think that this right to tinker, this freedom to tinker, remains legally protected.'' For now, however, the federal government seems to agree with Mr. Lowenstein. Last December, David M. Rocci, a 22-year-old from Blacksburg, Va., pleaded guilty to a federal charge of conspiring to import, market and sell modchips for the Xbox. In April, he was sentenced to five months in prison and five months of home detention. Simply from the standpoint of accessibility, the PlayStation 2 would seem to be a more likely candidate for hacking. IDG, the technology research firm, estimates that at the end of last year, 38.1 million PlayStation 2 units were in use in Europe, North America and Japan combined, compared with 6.7 million Xbox units in those regions. In one sense, however, the hacking scene for PlayStation 2 is less developed than the one for Xbox because there is less appetite for it. Sony sells an official conversion kit for the PlayStation 2 that includes a hard drive and allows that system to run the Linux operating system, which in turn allows the system to run MP3's, movies, spreadsheets or any other program or data that works under Linux. It is relatively easy for Sony to embrace Linux because Sony, unlike Microsoft, is not in the operating system business. The PlayStation 2 hacking community seems focused on developing chips that allow PlayStation 2 units to run illegal copies of games and games meant for far-flung parts of the world. (For marketing reasons, many PlayStation 2 games include regional coding, much as DVD's do.) In 2001, Sony sued an Australian for selling modchips that allowed Australian PlayStation 2 units to play games from other parts of the world. After the Australian government argued on the man's behalf, however, the Federal Court of Australia last July ruled mostly against Sony. Mr. von Lohmann said that Microsoft had not been particularly aggressive in combating Xbox hackers but that Sony had actively fought them. A Sony spokeswoman did not respond this week to requests for comment about the company's approach to hackers. For its part, Microsoft, through its public relations agency, indicated that it believed Xbox hackers were a relatively small band. ''Aside from a set of hobbyists,'' it said, ''the vast majority of Xbox owners are not focused on this niche.'' But those who are appear quite focused indeed. By e-mail, Mr. Steil, the German leader of the Xbox Linux project, declared: ''In very simple words: The Xbox is cheaper than a PC. The Xbox is a lot smaller than a PC. The Xbox looks better (next to a TV set). The Xbox is more silent. Therefore it's an ideal Linux computer in the living room.'' That was probably not the vision Mr. Gates had in mind."

                "WHEN the dust finally settled on the 2006 holiday buying season, American consumers — who braved long lines, cold weather and possibly a few kicks to the shins — had spent $3.7 billion on new video-game consoles and software. And while the more than two million youngsters (and not-so-youngsters) who discovered a next-generation gaming system under the Christmas tree — a Microsoft Xbox 360, a Sony PlayStation 3 or a Nintendo Wii — represent a substantial user base for these platforms, they mean even more to the entertainment industry as a whole. To the makers of these video-game systems and to a growing number of film and television studios, they represent a significant new audience for full-length movies and television shows that can be downloaded directly to gaming consoles. In late November Microsoft began expanding the library on its Xbox Live network, a broadband service available by subscription to Xbox 360 owners. In addition to the video-game trailers and playable demonstrations that the network has traditionally offered, you can now find an eclectically selected collection of films and television shows offered for downloading to a console’s hard drive: for a few dollars you can view “Mission: Impossible III” or “Chinatown” or the episode of “Chappelle’s Show” with the blind white supremacist, on your television, just as if you were watching a DVD or a video-on-demand channel.  For gamers with top-shelf home-theater setups, Xbox Live also offers content in high definition: download the HD version of the “Star Trek” episode “Mirror, Mirror,” in which the Enterprise crew is accidentally beamed into a malevolent alternate reality, and you can practically count each strand of hair in evil Mr. Spock’s goatee. This month XBox Live will offer a new view of the corpulent form of Eric Cartman when it becomes the first outlet ever to offer an episode of “South Park” in high definition. While Microsoft acknowledges that most consumers are buying Xbox 360s primarily, if not solely, to play video games, the company also sees an opportunity to use film and television content to draw an audience that doesn’t fit the stereotypical gamer profile.  “The original Xbox was probably the domain of that testosterone-fueled male in the household, and while we love him to death, we also want his little brother and sister and mom and dad and their friends to be able to enjoy it,” said Peter Moore, corporate vice president of Microsoft’s interactive entertainment business division.  To that end Microsoft spent several months negotiating with Hollywood studios and television networks, including Warner Brothers, Paramount, CBS and MTV, to secure a broad variety of programming before rolling out the expanded Xbox Live service.  Although more than 4.5 million Xbox 360s have been sold, and some 60 percent of owners are connected to Xbox Live, the network’s audience will not make broadcast television or movie theaters obsolete any time soon. Yet the kind of content most abundantly available on the network — goofy comedies like “Nacho Libre” and “Zoolander,” clips of Nascar races and adventure films like “Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior” — clearly indicates whom Microsoft expects to make the most use of it: men in their 20s and 30s with enough disposable income to buy lots of video games.  “This guy is typically not going to the movies, and more often than not he’s not watching television, he’s playing games in the living room,” Mr. Moore said. “He’s a difficult person to get to in the first place.”  It is Xbox Live’s potential to deliver such a narrowly defined and increasingly difficult-to-reach demographic that makes it so enticing to the entertainment industry. “This is, to a large extent, an entirely new audience for us,” said Steve Beeks, the president of Lionsgate, an independent studio whose library includes horror movies like “The Descent” and the “Saw” franchise and which recently announced it would make its films available for download on Xbox Live. “These are active buyers of games, but we don’t believe they’ve been active buyers of movies. We’re turning them into consumers of films.”  For television networks whose programming appears on the service, Xbox Live offers the additional benefit of a precise metric to determine how many gamers are downloading their shows and how many are then seeking out these shows on broadcast television.  “We’re gauging how different clips translate into what kind of pickup in viewership we get and what kind of buzz we’re getting on the blogs,” said Dennis Quinn, Turner Broadcasting’s executive vice president for business development. “If they’re watching a six-minute clip of ‘Robot Chicken,’ is that translating into a greater sampling of the network show? If we see older shows like ‘Harvey Birdman’ picking up again, what does that mean for people who produce the content?” At least one of Microsoft’s competitors is also preparing to enter this digital arena. Sony’s PlayStation 3, which comes with the ability to play high-definition Blu-ray DVDs, also allows gamers to connect to Sony’s own broadband network. Right now that network doesn’t offer much more than video-game demos and movie trailers, but that will soon change.  “As long as you’re downloading a trailer, what’s to stop us from offering the entire program, whether it’s a movie or a TV show?” said Peter Dille, the senior vice president for marketing for Sony Computer Entertainment America. “Being part of Sony Corporation, with a film entertainment company as a sister company and a music company at arm’s length, the world is our oyster in many respects.” For the moment Nintendo has no immediate plans to make film and television programming available for its Wii game console, which also lets gamers connect to an Internet-based network of content channels. But the company did not rule out the possibility.  “There’s a lot of plans we have for the channels,” said Perrin Kaplan, Nintendo’s vice president for marketing. “And there are ways that they could be used that we haven’t yet really conceived of.” Though Microsoft is the only gaming company to provide a substantial content library (roughly 100 movies and several hundred television episodes so far), some gamers feel the offerings are too limited to encourage them to use the feature regularly.  “Until you feel like it’s a pretty comprehensive list where you can look up just about anything, it’s not a service that I think most people will use,” said Dan Hsu, editor in chief of Electronic Gaming Monthly magazine. “You can just go, ‘Well, maybe I’ll check the iTunes music store or nbc.com and see if they have the shows that I want.’ ”  Other industry executives say the current push to provide entertainment content has more to do with satisfying console manufacturers’ needs than with fulfilling gamers’ demands.  “For this round of consoles it makes total sense that they have to focus on entertainment,” said Ricardo Sanchez, an executive at GameTap, a service that lets subscribers play console and arcade games on their personal computers. “For Sony I’ve got to believe the PS3 is as much about establishing Blu-ray as it is about selling games. On the Microsoft side they’re betting so much on Xbox Live that they’ll do practically anything to drive awareness and interest in it.”  At the same time, Mr. Sanchez said, “I don’t see them spending a lot of effort, beyond just aggregating content you can get elsewhere.”  Most gamers understand that in exchange for the ability to watch “South Park” reruns on demand, they are giving the console makers something: a valuable piece of real estate in their home-theater cabinets that a DVD player or stereo receiver might otherwise occupy. That bargain is especially precious for Microsoft, which is still better known as a monolithic software company than a trusted manufacturer of home electronics.  “This is following years of Bill Gates wanting to pursue something around a set-top box,” said Josh Larson, the director of the video-game Web site GameSpot.com. “It’s kind of a Trojan horse into the living room.” But as media ploys go, Mr. Larson would rather download his movies from Xbox Live than from PC-based services like Movielink or Amazon.com’s Unbox. “Is it more likely for a gamer that you’re going to download from iTunes and hook your PC up to your TV set?” he asked. “Or a couple button-pushes and you’re watching it in a way that you’re used to watching that content? I think that’s pretty powerful.” Despite the enduring perception that his company is seeking to conquer the universe, Mr. Moore said Microsoft was looking only to provide an audience of savvy, affluent media consumers with the kind of products they want in the way they’ve grown accustomed to consuming them. “In my case,” he said, “I very rarely watch live television anymore. Shows like ‘Lost,’ I’ll wait for the DVD, thank you, rather than have to see it chopped up into five-minute increments with four minutes of commercials. In today’s world we don’t have appointment viewing anymore.” More recently, Mr. Moore said, he was looking to catch up on some recent episodes of “CSI” — in high-definition, preferably — and sure enough, the only place he could find them was on Xbox Live. “I live in Seattle,” he explained, “and I have DirecTV. They don’t put the local networks on in high-def.”"

                "Owners of Microsoft's Xbox 360 game console will soon be able to watch science fiction epics as well as play them. Microsoft said last night that it would offer movies and episodes of television shows for downloading through its Xbox Live online service in the United States, starting Nov. 22. With the new offerings, Microsoft is joining cable giants and Internet start-ups on the long list of companies hoping to profit from video downloading. But Internet-based services have had trouble getting traction because it can be complex to send a downloaded film to a television screen and frustrating to watch it on the small screen of a computer. Owners of the Xbox have already connected it to a TV and, in most cases, the Internet. \"What makes this big is that there's no PC in the middle,\" said Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group. Microsoft has negotiated the rights to rent or sell more than 1,000 hours of material from CBS, MTV Networks, Paramount, Warner Brothers and Turner Broadcasting, along with the martial arts show \"Ultimate Fighting Championship.\" Some programs will be available in high-definition video. The video store will work much like that of Apple Computer, with some important differences. While users will be able to keep television shows, movies can be rented for only a limited period. The videos will not be playable on other devices and cannot be burned onto DVDs, but the online service will keep track of purchases so that users can log in to watch their videos on a friend's Xbox. Peter Moore, Microsoft's corporate vice president for interactive entertainment, said that the price of standard-definition videos would be comparable to what competitors charged. Apple's iTunes charges $1.99 for an episode of a television program. High-definition content will cost more, Mr. Moore said, because of the costs involved in storing it and making it available for downloading. Purchases will be made with points that users can buy with a credit card or a gift certificate, or win in contests. Mr. Moore said the service was partly intended to make the Xbox more versatile and therefore more attractive. \"Direct revenue from this over the long term could be important,\" Mr. Moore said. \"But this is also another reason to buy an Xbox 360.\" New game consoles from Sony and Nintendo are due out this month, a year after the Xbox 360 went on sale, so extra features could help Microsoft keep up in the marketplace. Nintendo is concentrating on game play, but Sony says it also has other content in mind. \"We haven't announced any content besides games,\" said Dave Karraker, a spokesman for Sony Computer Entertainment America, \"but all the executives have said that downloading other entertainment content is something the PlayStation 3 is capable of doing.\" Judging by the initial offerings, Xbox Live will be something of a cyberspace version of the Spike Channel, MTV Networks' cable channel aimed at young men. It will sell episodes of \"Star Trek,\" remastered in high definition, as well as the \"C.S.I.\" shows, some music videos and cartoons from the Cartoon Network's \"Adult Swim.\" \"The interesting thing is that we're delivering the 18-to-34-year-olds who aren't watching TV,\" Mr. Moore said. Microsoft has sold more than two million Xbox 360 consoles in the United States, according to the NPD Group, a market research firm. Most of those who buy the machines sign up for the Xbox Live service, which requires broadband Internet access and allows users to compete against each other. Since the introduction of the Xbox 360 last year, the service has also sold simple video games and other material. This year, Microsoft started to hint at its ambitions for the Xbox Live service when it purchased a company that places advertising in video games and made an ad deal with Cadillac. In the last few years, Microsoft has been pushing the idea of Media Center PCs, which are meant to sit in the living room and supply music and video to the stereo and the television set. But the concept has not caught on, in part because of the complexity of setting up and using these systems. Mr. Enderle said that apart from simplicity, another feature that would set the XBox Live service apart is that it will be the first service to sell downloadable movies in high definition, at a resolution similar to or better than a DVD. Until now, he said, most studios have been reluctant to allow cable channels to show movies in high definition for fear of piracy, but that would be less of a threat on XBox Live. Early next year, Apple plans to introduce a product that, on a preliminary basis, it is calling iTV and that is intended to be a bridge between the computer and the television set. But Microsoft will go into the video business with a different business model. Apple, most analysts maintain, does not make much money selling iTunes content, but makes up for that by selling more iPods, which are extremely profitable. Microsoft, which analysts say loses money on each Xbox 360 it sells, expects to make up for that by selling games -- and now video. \"This is a razors-and-blades business,\" Mr. Moore said. \"I've taken the hit on the razor. And the ability of Microsoft to offer more blades gives consumers more choice and drives more revenue.\" The video downloads, especially those in high definition, will take up a lot of space. Microsoft says a one-hour television program in high definition will take up about 2 gigabytes of the console's standard 20-gigabyte hard drive. Microsoft says the Xbox will play both movies and TV shows as they are being downloaded, although with larger files there will be a delay before playback starts, in contrast to the video-on-demand services offered by cable companies. High-definition movies will take an especially long while, depending on the speed of the Internet connection. Editors' Note: November 10, 2006, Friday An article in Business Day on Tuesday described a decision by Microsoft to offer movies and episodes of television shows for downloading through its Xbox Live online service in the United States. The article quoted Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group, discussing the features that set Xbox Live service apart and its position in the market. But the article did not note that Mr. Enderle had Microsoft as a client, a fact later pointed out by a reader. Mr. Enderle does consulting work for several of Microsoft's product groups, though not for the one developing the Xbox; still, had The Times known of Mr. Enderle's work for Microsoft, it would not have sought out his opinion on the product."

                "TOKYO — Microsoft is expected to slash the price of its Xbox 360 game console in Japan by about 30 percent, below the price of Nintendo's Wii and Sony's PlayStation 3 as it tries to increase its market share, a newspaper reported Monday. Demand for the Xbox 360 has been tepid in Japan, mainly due to a lack of popular games. In contrast, the market-leading Wii is thriving on a range of innovative software, prompting Nintendo to raise its earning forecast Friday. Hiroshi Kamide, a KBC Securities analyst, said a price cut alone is unlikely to trigger a jump in demand for the Xbox 360 and Microsoft needs to focus more on producing attractive software. \"Popular software is now serving as a tail wind to Xbox sales,\" he said. \"Even if they slash the console price, that would not directly boost sales unless they release more good software.\" Robust demand for Namco Bandai's \"Tales of Vesperia\" role-playing game helped Xbox 360's Japanese sales in the week ended Aug. 10. beat the PlayStation 3 for the first time. Microsoft will lower the price of the Xbox 360 Arcade model by ¥8,000 to ¥19,800, or about $180, the Nikkei business daily said. The Arcade does not come equipped with a hard drive and is the least expensive of the three Xbox 360 models. The company has already cut the price in the United States, Europe and four Asian markets as it tries to grab a larger chunk of the $57 billion game industry. The new price will make that model cheaper than Nintendo's Wii, which sells for about ¥25,000 yen, and the PlayStation 3, which sells for ¥39,800. The Wii's success has been attributed to inventive titles like the \"Wii Fit\" exercise game, its low price and its easy-to-learn motion-sensing controller. Microsoft will also reduce the price of two more expensive models with hard drives by ¥5,000 to ¥8,000, the paper said. Kazumi Ishiyama, a Microsoft Xbox spokeswoman in Japan, declined to comment on the Nikkei report. The company is scheduled to hold a briefing on the Xbox 360 in the Japanese market Monday afternoon. In Europe, the Xbox 360 Arcade model already costs less than the Wii. The Xbox 360 has lagged its Japanese rivals on their home turf, with 684,695 units sold so far in Japan against Wii's 6.67 million and PlayStation 3's 2.32 million, according to the game magazine publisher Enterbrain. The Xbox 360 was introduced about a year before its rivals."

Who gets to decide just what a particular product may be used for? The Xbox is a particularly attractive target for hackers because while it is essentially a standard PC modified to do only a few things, like play Xbox games, it is much cheaper than a PC. It is like an economy car modified to follow only a few roads -- but one potentially as powerful as a far more expensive model. In the Xbox, that power comes in the form of a 733-megahertz Intel processor, comparable to a midrange personal computer, and sophisticated graphics and audio systems. Its limited operating system, based on a version of Windows, can be used by a programmer to run simple software like a music player -- or the machine can run a new operating system altogether, namely Linux. ''The reality is that if you could bypass Microsoft's operating system you would end up with a fairly powerful computer for less than $200,'' the Manhattan financial executive said. In fact, Microsoft lowered the price for Xbox to $179.99 in May. In a sense, Xbox hackers are exploiting Microsoft's business model, which is to sell Xbox hardware at a loss (to build penetration of the system) and make the money back on royalties from the sale of Xbox software. A PC manufacturer like Dell, meanwhile, has to recoup its costs and generate a profit from the initial sale. So someone who buys the Xbox hardware, modifies it into a general-purpose computer and does not buy Xbox games potentially undermines not only Microsoft but also the personal computer industry. But that is not how some Xbox hackers think about it. ''Especially in Europe, computers are more expensive than they are here, and the Xbox is the cheapest computer you can get,'' Andrew Huang, author of a new book called ''Hacking the Xbox: An Introduction to Reverse Engineering,'' said in a telephone interview. ''Basically,'' he added by e-mail, ''once you have Linux, you have everything.'' It is unclear just how many Xbox hackers there are. Officials of the Interactive Digital Software Association, a trade group of video game publishers, said that Xbox hacking appeared more prevalent in parts of Asia than in North America. Michael Steil, a 24-year-old German who is project leader of a group that calls itself the Xbox Linux Project, said by e-mail that a full version of Linux software for the Xbox had been downloaded more than 220,000 times. Whatever the numbers, Microsoft does not appear eager to discuss Xbox hacking. In recent weeks, a Microsoft public relations representative repeatedly declined to make any company executives available to discuss the matter. Instead, the company issued a statement through a public relations firm that said in part: ''Microsoft is a company passionate about innovation and creativity. We are also very committed to respect for others' intellectual property and we request the same respect applied to our innovations.'' The statement made no reference to the potential use of hacked Xbox consoles as personal computers, saying Microsoft's ''primary concern'' was with the sale of modified chips for the boxes ''that enable game counterfeiting.'' And that is the area that most clearly raises legal issues. Although there are several methods, hacking an Xbox typically involves obtaining a special chip called a modchip, available on the Internet, and soldering it into the machine. (For those who find the process daunting, there are also vendors on the Internet who sell ''pre-modded'' Xbox units.) Modchips, of which there are several varieties, allow users to load new versions of the basic computer code, known as the BIOS, that tells the machine how to operate. A hacked BIOS generally incorporates modified versions of copyrighted Microsoft code and so is generally illegal. The main Web sites that deal with Xbox hacking do not include links to hacked BIOS, and hackers generally find their forbidden fruit in Internet chat rooms. Once the modchip is installed and the BIOS modified, the console can do a number of things it cannot do ''out of the box.'' Xbox games normally must be run from an optical disk, and a hacked Xbox can ''back up'' a game to the unit's hard drive and run the game without the disk. This technique could be used simply to avoid having to insert and remove disks -- or it could be used for piracy (say, by renting a game, putting the software on the hard drive and returning the game). Until passage of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act in 1998, the mere sale of a modified chip would not have appeared illegal. That law, however, prohibits the sale of devices that are primarily meant to circumvent copyright protection. Companies and technologists will fight over the exact legal meaning of those provisions for years. For now, however, the software industry is relying on them. ''Our view over all on modchips is that they are illegal infringing devices, that where we find people engaged in the widespread manufacturing and distribution of them, we and our members, individually and collectively, are committed to doing what we can to shut down their manufacturing and go after the distributors,'' said Doug Lowenstein, president of the Interactive Digital Software Association. Some advocates, however, say that while software piracy is illegal and morally offensive, the mere act of modifying hardware should not be illegal. ''The most important dimension of this debate from our view is that people should have the right to tinker with the stuff that they own,'' said Fred von Lohmann, senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a civil-liberties group in San Francisco. ''Others will say that this is about piracy and all that, but they forget that the principle of tinkering with the stuff that you own was the principle on which the entire personal computer industry was founded,'' he added. ''This is basic business and basic science in the technology world and we think that this right to tinker, this freedom to tinker, remains legally protected.'' For now, however, the federal government seems to agree with Mr. Lowenstein. Last December, David M. Rocci, a 22-year-old from Blacksburg, Va., pleaded guilty to a federal charge of conspiring to import, market and sell modchips for the Xbox. In April, he was sentenced to five months in prison and five months of home detention. Simply from the standpoint of accessibility, the PlayStation 2 would seem to be a more likely candidate for hacking. IDG, the technology research firm, estimates that at the end of last year, 38.1 million PlayStation 2 units were in use in Europe, North America and Japan combined, compared with 6.7 million Xbox units in those regions. In one sense, however, the hacking scene for PlayStation 2 is less developed than the one for Xbox because there is less appetite for it. Sony sells an official conversion kit for the PlayStation 2 that includes a hard drive and allows that system to run the Linux operating system, which in turn allows the system to run MP3's, movies, spreadsheets or any other program or data that works under Linux. It is relatively easy for Sony to embrace Linux because Sony, unlike Microsoft, is not in the operating system business. The PlayStation 2 hacking community seems focused on developing chips that allow PlayStation 2 units to run illegal copies of games and games meant for far-flung parts of the world. (For marketing reasons, many PlayStation 2 games include regional coding, much as DVD's do.) In 2001, Sony sued an Australian for selling modchips that allowed Australian PlayStation 2 units to play games from other parts of the world. After the Australian government argued on the man's behalf, however, the Federal Court of Australia last July ruled mostly against Sony. Mr. von Lohmann said that Microsoft had not been particularly aggressive in combating Xbox hackers but that Sony had actively fought them. A Sony spokeswoman did not respond this week to requests for comment about the company's approach to hackers. For its part, Microsoft, through its public relations agency, indicated that it believed Xbox hackers were a relatively small band. ''Aside from a set of hobbyists,'' it said, ''the vast majority of Xbox owners are not focused on this niche.'' But those who are appear quite focused indeed. By e-mail, Mr. Steil, the German leader of the Xbox Linux project, declared: ''In very simple words: The Xbox is cheaper than a PC. The Xbox is a lot smaller than a PC. The Xbox looks better (next to a TV set). The Xbox is more silent. Therefore it's an ideal Linux computer in the living room.'' That was probably not the vision Mr. Gates had in mind."

                "Users of Microsoft’s popular Xbox Kinect gaming console will soon be able to use voice and motion commands to interact with advertisements while they are playing their favorite game or watching a video. On Tuesday, Microsoft is set to announce a new suite of advertising tools, called NUads, short for natural user-interface ads, that will let users interact with advertising on the console dashboard or embedded in games and other video content. The ads use the same voice and motion control developed for the company’s Kinect game console, which it introduced in time for the 2010 holiday season.  The new ads are intended to help advertisers keep the attention of Xbox users in a way that traditional television advertising does not.  “When you have highly interactive people and a passive medium, they are interacting with their phone or their laptop while watching TV,” said Mark Kroese, the general manager of the advertising business group at Microsoft. The new ads, Mr. Kroese said, “create a natural way for the user to engage with the TV.”  At least one advertising agency seems to agree.  “The new ad units really epitomized the level of engagement that everyone is working towards,” said John M. Lisko, the executive communications director of Saatchi & Saatchi Los Angeles, part of the Publicis Groupe. Mr. Lisko said the agency had successfully advertised on the Xbox console in the past and was “absolutely considering” the new capabilities. “You can text, you can tweet, you can vote,” he said. “That’s phenomenal.”  Using voice commands, gamers will be able to send messages about an ad to a social networking site like Twitter by saying “Xbox Tweet.” Advertisers who want to send more information about a product or promotion associated with a campaign can prompt Xbox users to say “Xbox More,” which will send users an e-mail with the information they wanted.  For advertising tied to events like television shows, advertisers can prompt a user to say “Xbox Schedule” and the system will send a text message reminder to the user’s mobile phone. Similarly, advertisers can prompt users to say “Xbox Near Me” and a map to the nearest retailer will be sent to their mobile phone. Finally, advertisers can prompt users to vote on a topic by asking the user to wave their hand in front of the console and select their favorite pizza topping, superhero or clothing brand.  The new advertising options will be presented on Tuesday to advertisers at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, an annual conference for advertisers and marketers. Consumers will begin to see the new features in the spring of 2012.  The new ads will be simple for marketers to deploy since they can use the same commercials they would use on television.  “What we’re seeing now is a technology environment where marketers can deliver more sophisticated ads and they don’t have some of the hurdles that in-game marketers and in-game publishers had,” said Paul Verna, a senior analyst at eMarketer. “It’s a level of interactivity that suggests more possibilities than we’ve seen up until now.” "

                "The daughter of a Brazilian Catholic mother and a Palestinian Muslim father, Fatima Shama, 39, grew up in the Bronx, attending Roman Catholic school during the week, Muslim “Sunday school” on Saturdays and church on Sundays. She speaks six languages, which comes in handy for her job as the commissioner of the Mayor’s Office of Immigrant Affairs, a position she has held since 2009. (Recently, her office reached out to immigrant communities affected by Hurricane Sandy to help them navigate government resources and aid.) She lives in Turtle Bay in Manhattan with her husband, Ziad Mansouri, 42, who works at JPMorgan Chase, and their three sons, Samir, 8; Ibrahim, 5; and Omar, 2. She and her husband are raising them as Muslims, with a generous dose of other religious traditions. WAKE-UP CALL My kids tend to wake me up — that’s about 6:30, 7 o’clock. Coffee is absolutely essential. It’s almost the first thing I do. Then we get the Sunday Times. My youngest son loves to be the person to get it for me. INTERNATIONAL BREAKFAST It could be me deciding to make Belgian waffles or pancakes, or it’s possible I’ll make — my kids love an Arabic breakfast food called lebni — basically, strained yogurt, and you eat it with pita bread. And they love an Arabic string cheese and another kind of cheese common to the region called haloumi, a must to every breakfast table in our house OUTSIDE VOICES Sundays are absolutely about family and spending time with our kids. From 11 to 2 is our outside time. We might go ice skating at Wollman Rink, or the Central Park Zoo; we are there a lot and we love it. I think that the kids would probably say the Museum of Natural History is their favorite, just ‘cause of what we get to see. It’s everything from butterflies and frogs and lizards to the dinosaurs or the elephants. And they can be loud and we don’t have to apologize to anybody. Sometimes we’ll do excursions out of the city, or there might be a children’s birthday party or two, given our kids’ social lives. PARADER IN CHIEF If it’s summertime, there’s likely a parade that I might march in or a community event I might stop by. Of course, during the hurricane, every Sunday we were out in the community. But if it’s summertime, rest assured there’s a parade in my future. BOYS’ TIME Our kids are only allowed to play their electronics on the weekends. Our kids got an Xbox for Christmas — I grew up in a dual home, so my kids have the pleasure of learning about their own faith, but also being able to celebrate the faith of my siblings and mother. The Xbox Kinect Dance Central game, I will tell you that is hysterical. I actually love the fact that this Kinect thing helps them jump around. And Sunday football is a big deal. We’re a Giants home, but my sons love the Tampa Bay Buccaneers — their mascot is a pirate, so we think that’s how it started. My oldest son can tell you anything about football. SHOPPING, COOKING I try to cook for the week or make some Sunday dinner for us, so I might run to the supermarket. I love to cook with my kids. My middle son loves to make a Brazilian cheese bread, so we make that a lot. We make black beans and rice, there’s always a pasta night — I do make, actually, a lot of Arabic food. WINDING DOWN Then it’s dinner, bath time and we do reading every night. Our kids are in bed by about 8:30. And it’s my date with “Downton Abbey.” Lady Grantham, the grandmother, I just love her absolutely dry sarcasm and her love of the monarchy and all things traditional. And I try to clean out my e-mail before Monday morning, do what I can do to make life better before Monday morning. FINISHING UP This is actually a very true thing: I basically don’t go to sleep until I finish the paper so I can put it out into the recycling bin. Otherwise it becomes a pile. I actually try to finish all of my Sunday paper and I actually read the paper — Sunday in particular — minus a couple sections, cover to cover. I love holding the paper, but I love the ads. I like to look at the jewelry ads. Even though I could never buy any of it."

                "NEW YORK — Reaching out to millions of aspiring game developers around the world, Microsoft is holding a contest that will award $10,000 and the opportunity to entice millions of viewers to the next great digital diversion for the company's Xbox 360. In addition to the game console's snazzy graphics, the Xbox Live online service has been the most important component of the Xbox 360's success since its debut in 2005. And perhaps the most popular aspect of Xbox Live has been the service's arcade component, which allows users to download and play smaller, relatively simple games like \"Uno\" and \"Geometry Wars\" that usually cost less than $10. (By contrast, top-end games can sell in stores for around $60.) The popularity of Xbox Live Arcade has in turn attracted the attention of game developers looking to create the next \"Tetris\" or \"Minesweeper.\" Late last year, Microsoft introduced a suite of software tools for making so- called casual games called XNA. So at a convention of game makers Monday in San Francisco, Microsoft was to announce a contest that will award a cash prize and a potential slot on Xbox Live Arcade to the best game created with XNA tools. The company intends to announce the winner of the \"Dream-Build-Play\" contest in August. \"This competition highlights the power of XNA and the popularity of the Xbox Live Arcade service, with its millions of users,\" Aaron Greenberg, Microsoft's group product manager for the Xbox 360 and Xbox Live, said by phone. To help increase the popularity of casual games, Microsoft is also introducing a 512-megabyte portable storage device for the Xbox 360. The previous portable storage unit contained only 64 megabytes of data, and so Xbox Live Arcade games had been limited to an official size of 50 megabytes. With the new unit, Microsoft will also raise the official size limit on Xbox Live Arcade games to 150 megabytes, allowing enhanced graphics, sound and artificial intelligence."

                "LOS ANGELES — In what may be one of the costliest consumer warranty repairs in history, Microsoft announced on Thursday that it would spend up to $1.15 billion to repair failing Xbox 360 game machine consoles. While the company would not say how many units were failing, Robbie Bach, president of Microsoft's entertainment and devices division, said that there have been an \"unacceptable high number of repairs.\" The majority of Xbox 360 owners, he said, have not experienced hardware failure. Company officials said that Microsoft had sold 11.6 million Xbox 360 units by the end of June, shy of the 12 million units the company had predicted. The Xbox 360, which first went of sale in November 2005, is currently the best-selling game machine in the United States, according to NPD, a market research firm. The size of the anticipated repair bill suggests that a third to as many as half of the machines are flawed. Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington State, said it would take a charge of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion against earnings in the quarter ended June 30. Consumers know they have a problem if three red flashing lights appear on the console. Gamers on online forums have been referring to the event as \"the Red Ring of Death\" because the machine then shuts down. The company declined to explain the nature of the failure, but said that it was not caused by a single problem in the console, which it said contained 1,700 components and 500 million transistors. The company also said there were no health or safety concerns involved. The problem began to appear over the last three to four months, Bach said, after \"significant usage\" of the consoles. He said the company has taken steps to correct the problem in new devices. Microsoft said it would extend the warranty of the game console to three years to customers worldwide. Previously, products sold in the United States were covered by a one-year warranty, while Xbox 360 units sold in Europe had a two-year warranty. In addition, customers who have had their consoles repaired because of the \"three flashing lights\" problem will be reimbursed for the cost of the repairs. Microsoft has succeeded in establishing the Xbox brand against the better known Sony PlayStation and other game machines. The Xbox and its successor, the Xbox 360, was the software maker's first major foray into hardware. Although sales are small relative to the rest of Microsoft's revenue, the Xbox has been an important venture for the company and was viewed by many analysts as Microsoft's attempt to compete with the likes of Sony and Apple for control of electronics and entertainment within homes. The device can be used to access the Internet and view movies. Microsoft said its entertainment and devices division reported an operating loss of $315 million on $929 million in revenue for the three-month period that ended in March, and analysts have estimated that the company lost about $6 billion getting a foothold in the game machine industry. A new Xbox 360 with a 20-gigabyte hard drive sells for about $400, but other versions cost about $300. The announcement comes on the eve of the E3 Media and Business Summit, the video-game industry's major trade show, to be held next week in Los Angeles. \"This is bound to affect discussions between Microsoft and its developers and retailers,\" said Richard Doherty, a partner in the research company Envisioneering Group."

                "Editors’ Note Appended Owners of Microsoft’s Xbox 360 game console will soon be able to watch science fiction epics as well as play them.  Microsoft said last night that it would offer movies and episodes of television shows for downloading through its Xbox Live online service in the United States, starting Nov. 22.  With the new offerings, Microsoft is joining cable giants and Internet start-ups on the long list of companies hoping to profit from video downloading. But Internet-based services have had trouble getting traction because it can be complex to send a downloaded film to a television screen and frustrating to watch it on the small screen of a computer. Owners of the Xbox have already connected it to a TV and, in most cases, the Internet. “What makes this big is that there’s no PC in the middle,” said Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group. Microsoft has negotiated the rights to rent or sell more than 1,000 hours of material from CBS, MTV Networks, Paramount, Warner Brothers and Turner Broadcasting, along with the martial arts show “Ultimate Fighting Championship.” Some programs will be available in high-definition video. The video store will work much like that of Apple Computer, with some important differences. While users will be able to keep television shows, movies can be rented for only a limited period. The videos will not be playable on other devices and cannot be burned onto DVDs, but the online service will keep track of purchases so that users can log in to watch their videos on a friend’s Xbox.  Peter Moore, Microsoft’s corporate vice president for interactive entertainment, said that the price of standard-definition videos would be comparable to what competitors charged. Apple’s iTunes charges $1.99 for an episode of a television program.  High-definition content will cost more, Mr. Moore said, because of the costs involved in storing it and making it available for downloading. Purchases will be made with points that users can buy with a credit card or a gift certificate, or win in contests.  Mr. Moore said the service was partly intended to make the Xbox more versatile and therefore more attractive. “Direct revenue from this over the long term could be important,” Mr. Moore said. “But this is also another reason to buy an Xbox 360.”  New game consoles from Sony and Nintendo are due out this month, a year after the Xbox 360 went on sale, so extra features could help Microsoft keep up in the marketplace. Nintendo is concentrating on game play, but Sony says it also has other content in mind.  “We haven’t announced any content besides games,” said Dave Karraker, a spokesman for Sony Computer Entertainment America, “but all the executives have said that downloading other entertainment content is something the PlayStation 3 is capable of doing.” Judging by the initial offerings, Xbox Live will be something of a cyberspace version of the Spike Channel, MTV Networks’ cable channel aimed at young men. It will sell episodes of “Star Trek,” remastered in high definition, as well as the “C.S.I.” shows, some music videos and cartoons from the Cartoon Network’s “Adult Swim.”  “The interesting thing is that we’re delivering the 18-to-34-year-olds who aren’t watching TV,” Mr. Moore said. Microsoft has sold more than two million Xbox 360 consoles in the United States, according to the NPD Group, a market research firm. Most of those who buy the machines sign up for the Xbox Live service, which requires broadband Internet access and allows users to compete against each other.  Since the introduction of the Xbox 360 last year, the service has also sold simple video games and other material. This year, Microsoft started to hint at its ambitions for the Xbox Live service when it purchased a company that places advertising in video games and made an ad deal with Cadillac.  In the last few years, Microsoft has been pushing the idea of Media Center PCs, which are meant to sit in the living room and supply music and video to the stereo and the television set. But the concept has not caught on, in part because of the complexity of setting up and using these systems.  Mr. Enderle said that apart from simplicity, another feature that would set the XBox Live service apart is that it will be the first service to sell downloadable movies in high definition, at a resolution similar to or better than a DVD.  Until now, he said, most studios have been reluctant to allow cable channels to show movies in high definition for fear of piracy, but that would be less of a threat on XBox Live.  Early next year, Apple plans to introduce a product that, on a preliminary basis, it is calling iTV and that is intended to be a bridge between the computer and the television set. But Microsoft will go into the video business with a different business model. Apple, most analysts maintain, does not make much money selling iTunes content, but makes up for that by selling more iPods, which are extremely profitable. Microsoft, which analysts say loses money on each Xbox 360 it sells, expects to make up for that by selling games — and now video.  “This is a razors-and-blades business,” Mr. Moore said. “I’ve taken the hit on the razor. And the ability of Microsoft to offer more blades gives consumers more choice and drives more revenue.”  The video downloads, especially those in high definition, will take up a lot of space. Microsoft says a one-hour television program in high definition will take up about 2 gigabytes of the console’s standard 20-gigabyte hard drive. Microsoft says the Xbox will play both movies and TV shows as they are being downloaded, although with larger files there will be a delay before playback starts, in contrast to the video-on-demand services offered by cable companies. High-definition movies will take an especially long while, depending on the speed of the Internet connection. "

                "It was nearly a decade ago that a young Microsoft programmer named J. Allard sounded the alarm and convinced Bill Gates that the Internet was a threat to the dominance of the Microsoft Windows operating system. On Monday, Microsoft will announce Mr. Allard's next big gamble: an ambitious billion-dollar-plus investment in an online game service to be called Xbox Live. Microsoft hopes to create what it describes as the equivalent of an online Disneyland, globally accessible over the Internet, where gamers who subscribe can find partners for dozens of different adventure, racing and sports games. The company is betting the service will save its Xbox video-game system, which began shipping last November but still lags far behind the industry-leading Sony PlayStation 2, which has nearly 30 million units in use worldwide, compared with only 3.5 million for the Xbox. (There are an estimated four million to five million Nintendo GameCube consoles now in use.) While Sony and Nintendo have online plans, networked game playing is peripheral to their video-game strategies. For Microsoft, it has been integral to the Xbox plan from the beginning -- the wedge with which Microsoft hopes to gain entry to the nation's and world's living rooms and become an entertainment powerhouse. It is a bet as ambitious as it is expensive. When Microsoft opens the electronic doors for its service this summer, the Internet technology in its three data centers in London, Seattle and Tokyo will have more capacity than its own Microsoft.com, which itself is one of the world's largest Web sites. The risk is that Microsoft is entering a quagmire that will soak up vast amounts of investment and lock the company in a bitter, potentially unwinnable battle with Sony and Nintendo, which will each be describing their own online services at this week's game industry convention, the Electronic Entertainment Expo, which starts Wednesday in Los Angeles. For Xbox Live to become a success the company acknowledges that it will have to attract millions of customers willing to pay $50 or more for each game's software and perhaps a $9.95 monthly subscription, in addition to the $40 to $60 a month for the high-speed Internet connection the service will require. Those are big if's, because while video games have become a wildly popular form of home entertainment, online game playing -- so far mainly employing personal computers, not game consoles -- has never appealed to more than a fraction of Internet users, and in almost all cases, only when it is free. Even more daunting is the fact that there is little evidence that video games have expanded much beyond their core audience of adolescent and college-age males. ''Gaming is a very age-specific and demographic-specific device and experience,'' said Mitchell Kertzmann, the chief executive office of Liberate Technologies, an interactive television equipment supplier based in San Carlos, Calif. There have already been well-publicized failures in the online gaming business. During the Internet bubble, start-ups like Total Entertainment Network and MPATH rose and fell on the promise of offering Web game portals for paying PC customers. And Sega, the one video-game company that did start an online service, Sega.net, way back in 2000, has dropped that service and no longer even makes game consoles, now focusing instead on software. ''It only works when you get to significantly high numbers of subscribers,'' said Lawrence Probst, chairman and chief executive officer of Electronic Arts, the largest maker of computer and video-game software. ''We've learned that the hard way with EA.com,'' he said, referring to the company's online computer-game service, whose only profitable component is the medieval-themed Ultima Online, which has about 200,000 subscribers. Another challenge may arise in household geography. In most homes, the video-game console is located in the living room, where the television set is -- nowhere near the high-speed Internet connection in the den. That assumes, of course that the den has a high-speed connection. Microsoft asserts that as many as half of its Xbox customers already have high-speed, or broadband, Internet connections. But so far only 12 percent of the nation's households have broadband Internet, according to Odyssey, a market research firm in San Francisco, and the number is growing only slowly. ''If this service requires broadband, just put it in the icebox for awhile,'' said Nick Donatiello, Odyssey's president. And yet Microsoft's new service does have its defenders, industry executives who think that online gaming can reach a broader audience than stand-alone video games have. ''Microsoft has the resources to make online gaming successful,'' said Charles Bellfield, the vice president for corporate strategy at Sega, which develops games for the Xbox and will offer versions for Xbox Live. ''It may not happen on day one, but by the time gaming reaches the mainstream, it will be doing well.'' Mr. Allard, who is now general manager of Microsoft's Xbox division, argues that Microsoft can create a mass audience by the force of a huge effort and by the company's ability to tap into a latent demand that he said he first detected three years ago. In an interview last week, Mr. Allard recalled the epiphany. While visiting a Seattle video-game arcade with other Xbox designers in 1999 he realized that the longest lines were all formed around the multiplayer games -- the basketball, car racing, tank warfare and other competitions in which players compete on individual or clustered machines. He said he came to believe that it would be the ''social'' experience offered by the Internet that would drive the next major generation of video games. That is why he committed the company to add the $40 to $50 worth of hardware to each Xbox needed to make every console Internet ready. Now Microsoft is ready to tap that built-in capability. On Monday, the company plans to announce that it will begin consumer tests of Xbox Live this summer with a one-year subscription and a headset, for $49, that will enable Xbox owners with high-speed Internet connections to compete and converse with one another online. Despite speculation that the company might use its online network connection to link Xbox users to Microsoft's other services, Mr. Allard insists that Xbox Live will stay focused on gaming. Robert J. Bach, a Microsoft senior vice president in charge of its games division said the company was planning a service that he compared to Disneyland for its safe, wholesome environment -- in contrast to the ''Coney Island'' he said that the open Internet can sometimes become. ''Compare Coney Island to Disneyland,'' he said. ''When you're at Disneyland, there's no trash, no violence and you never see security. That's what we have in mind.'' Mr. Allard invoked to the same metaphor to criticize his biggest competitor's approach. ''I won't deny that I've occasionally referred to Sony's online service as Sony Island,'' Mr. Allard said. Sony, which has said that it will begin selling a $40 adaptor for connecting the PlayStation 2 to the Internet either via dial-up modem or high-speed connection in August, makes no apologies for its approach. Although the company will not attempt to match Microsoft's ambitious online theme-park environment, neither will Sony attempt to charge users for playing its video games online -- at least not initially. If the gaming experiences are comparable for players, a free service based on Sony's market-dominating video-game console could prove an insurmountable rival to Microsoft's fee-based ''walled garden'' approach. Moreover, unlike Microsoft's command-and-control approach to the Xbox Live network, the Sony service will not force independent game publishers to provide their online PlayStation games through Sony's own network. That difference was highlighted when executives at Electronic Arts said last week that they planned an online alliance with Sony but remained unsure whether to get involved with Microsoft's XBox Live. Electronic Arts said it worried it might risk losing its customers to competing Microsoft games. Sony executives, meanwhile, questioned whether Xbox Live could ever justify itself financially. ''If I were Microsoft, I would spend my money first on selling units rather than building an online service,'' said Kazuo Hirai, the president and chief operating officer of Sony Computer Entertainment America. None of this deters Mr. Allard. Just as 3D graphics propelled growth in the last generation of video games, he said, Microsoft's ability to create a social experience will drive the next generation of gaming. ''The pendulum has swung too far in the single-user direction,'' he said. A critical component of the social experience planned for Xbox Live will be the audio headset, enabling players to cheer and jeer one another. The technology includes a ''voice masking'' feature that will conceal the identities and even ages of the contestants -- a Disneyland safeguard meant to deter adult exploitation of children online. Some analysts agree with Microsoft that voice capabilities could take video gaming to the next level. ''You're looking at a service that will become a new phone network overnight,'' said Richard Doherty, president of Envisioneering, a research and consulting firm in Seaford, N.Y. ''By Christmas, Microsoft could become the nation's fourth-largest phone company.''"

                "LOS ANGELES  Microsoft, seeking to expand offerings on its Xbox 360 console, has reached an agreement with a company headed by Peter Safran, the veteran Hollywood producer and talent manager, to produce original shows for distribution on the system. Through his Safran Company, Mr. Safran represents clients like the actor and producer Sean Combs (“Monster’s Ball”), the actor and writer Nia Vardalos (“My Big Fat Greek Wedding”) and the filmmakers Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer (“Epic Movie”). Mr. Safran founded the company in 2006 after leaving Brillstein-Grey Management. Speaking by telephone last week, Scott Nocas, global marketing manager for programming of the Xbox Live entertainment service, said he expected similar deals to follow. “We definitely look at this as the first of many,” said Mr. Nocas. In an interview at his office in Los Angeles last week, Mr. Safran said his first round of programs would all be scripted, as opposed to reality shows, and would probably run under 10 minutes. He said he planned initially to focus on genres, like comedy and horror, that appeal to the Xbox 360 audience, which is heavily concentrated from the ages of 14 to 34, and tends to be more male than female. The first shows are expected to be available to viewers by the fall. Microsoft’s previous forays in digital entertainment include a two-year-old initiative, MSN Originals, to provide original shows for the Web, and an ill-fated foray more than 10 years ago in which it poured about $100 million into Internet shows like the comedy “475 Madison,” about an advertising agency, then quickly canceled most of them. “The Xbox is unique. It operates at a level outside of what we generally consider Web entertainment,” Mr. Safran said, referring to the system’s tight demographic base, which is defined by the appeal of signature games like the Halo series.  The new shows will be available exclusively via the Xbox 360 for a time, then may appear elsewhere, Mr. Safran said. Mr. Nocas said at least some of the shows would be supported by advertising. Current programming on the Xbox 360 includes movies and selections from cable networks like the Sundance Channel and Spike TV. Viewers pay for access to films with points that can be purchased for cash or accumulated through activities on the system. Mr. Nocas said that about 10 million people had signed up for the Xbox Live service. Roughly 18 million of the game systems have been sold worldwide, he said. The Xbox 360 is up against PlayStation 3 from Sony and the Wii from Nintendo in a hotly competitive gaming marketplace. Mr. Safran is the latest in a growing line of Hollywood players who are seeking to tap into the digital entertainment market, where revenue still falls far short of that from traditional movie and television distribution outlets. Filmmakers like Joel and Ethan Coen and stars like Will Ferrell have recently become involved with Web-based companies like FunnyOrDie.com or 60Frames Entertainment. Mr. Safran and Jake Zim, chief operating officer of the Safran Company’s Safran Digital Group, said they expected to recruit established filmmakers for their new productions, but did not plan to seek involvement by major movie stars."

                "LOS ANGELES — Underscoring the importance Microsoft attaches to its video game efforts, Bill Gates has laid out a vision of a future in which gamers using the Xbox 360 console can be connected to others on a personal computer or a cellphone. The capabilities, part of an initiative called Live Anywhere, will be incorporated into the Windows Vista operating system when it goes on sale next year, he said Tuesday. \"The future is making gaming attractive to people of every age,\" he said. For Gates, Microsoft's chairman, it was the first appearance ever in connection with the Electronic Entertainment Expo, the huge annual video game trade show known as E3, which was to open on Wednesday in Los Angeles. His presence underscored the stakes in Microsoft's push to outflank the other two console makers, Sony and Nintendo. Microsoft has a head start. It introduced Xbox 360 last November, and after some initial supply constraints, 5 million to 5.5 million consoles will have been sold by the end of next month, said Peter Moore, a Microsoft vice president for interactive entertainment. He predicted sales of 10 million units by this fall, when Sony will release the PlayStation 3 and Nintendo the Wii (pronounced \"we\"). By this holiday season, Microsoft said, 160 games will be available for Xbox 360, including \"Grand Theft Auto IV,\" \"Splinter Cell: Double Agent\" and \"Forza Motorsport 2,\" for which Microsoft will sell a wireless steering wheel and headset. In addition, an external module for the Xbox 360 to play high-definition DVDs will be available by the holidays. While the PlayStation 3 will incorporate a drive for movies and games in Blu-ray, Sony's high-definition format, the Microsoft device will be used solely to play movies in a competing format, HD-DVD. With Microsoft's Live Anywhere system, game developers will be able to incorporate features that allow users to send instant messages between devices, and see if their friends are listening to music on their mobile phone or working on a PC. On certain games, players will be able to begin play on the Xbox 360, then switch to a mobile phone; they could also challenge others remotely regardless of whether they were using a PC or an Xbox 360. Sony got the week's events off to a start on Monday by announcing that the PlayStation 3 would be priced higher than expected, with versions selling for $499 and $599 - compared with $299 and $399 for the Xbox 360. At a Nintendo press event on Tuesday, there were no details about the pricing of its own new console beyond a promise from Reggie Fils-Aime, Nintendo of America's executive vice president of sales and marketing, that \"we will give you more fun for less money.\" In addition to new versions of its Zelda and Super Mario games, Nintendo also showed Wii Sports, which includes tennis, golf and Ping-Pong games designed to take advantage of the console's controller, which allows gamers to alter the action by waving it in space much like a club or baseball bat. Sony said Monday that it was incorporating motion sensors into the PlayStation 3 controller as well, but Microsoft said it was not worried by that move."

                "AS Microsoft enters the video game market with the release of its Xbox console on Thursday, some investors are placing their bets on allied companies like Flextronics, which is manufacturing the Xbox console, and Nvidia, which provides the graphics chip for the unit. To meet sales estimates of 1 million to 1.5 million game players before the end of the year, Microsoft is moving well beyond its normal marketing channels. The Xbox release includes cross-promotions with partners like Taco Bell and MTV. But even if sales reach that goal, Xbox will not ''move the needle a whole lot'' in terms of revenues for a company as big as Microsoft, said Jeff Bernstein, a portfolio manager with ING Pilgrim funds in New York. Microsoft is selling the Xbox for less than it costs to maked in the hope of eventually profiting on software development and licensing, several analysts said. But Xbox has already moved the needle on shares of Nvidia, a chip maker with a market capitalization of $7 billion. Its stock price has risen 90 percent since the beginning of 2001. It closed on Friday at $53.20. The company, based in Santa Clara, Calif., said earnings for the quarter ended Oct. 31 rose to $44.7 million, up from $28.1 million for the same period a year earlier. The company said it shipped $57.4 million worth of Xbox chips in the quarter, which counted against a $200 million advance Microsoft gave the company for initial Xbox production. ''There's a nice ramp of revenues coming from the Xbox,'' Mr. Bernstein said. Xbox revenues are expected to account for more than 10 percent of the company's revenues in 2002, a Nvidia spokesman, Derek Perez, said. Mr. Bernstein said he expected that Nvidia's earnings would push the stock price to $60 a share by mid-2002. That may not be high enough to justify an investment, he said, considering the riskiness of the video game market. ''You would have to be an aggressive investor to buy it here,'' Mr. Bernstein said. Flextronics may be a more conservative choice. Despite layoffs of about 10,000 employees in late October, or 15 percent of its work force, and a quarterly loss of $330 million, the company has weathered the technology slump relatively well, many analysts said. Because Flextronics makes telecommunications equipment, hand-held computers and a number of other electronic and computer products for a range of major companies, it is not as dependent on Xbox. ''In looking at its business, the Xbox isn't a significant percentage of Flextronics' revenues,'' said Dominic Vignola, an analyst for the Merrill Lynch Global Technology fund. ''But it has the opportunity for a deepening relationship with Microsoft.'' In the last month, Flextronics shares have risen 14 percent, but they are down 22 percent since Jan. 1. Mr. Vignola said Flextronics' business of manufacturing products for companies like Cisco Systems, Microsoft, Lucent Technologies and other major technology players should grow rapidly as those companies focus more of their resources on research and marketing. Wall Street analysts are expecting Xbox to contribute roughly $150 million a quarter to the revenues of Flextronics. Mr. Bernstein's fund is projecting 18 percent revenue growth, which, he said, could push the stock close to $40 over the next six to nine months. It closed on Friday at $22.20. BUT the estimates depend on the success of the Xbox. Ray Scanlon, a software industry analyst at Citigroup Asset Management, said that if Microsoft reaches its sales goal, the Xbox can contribute more than $2 billion of the firm's total estimated revenues of $27 billion in the 2002 fiscal year. That would still consign gaming to the second tier of Microsoft's product line in economic importance, behind the operating system and software divisions, Mr. Scanlon said. Microsoft is likely to keep investing heavily in Xbox for the next couple of years to compete with the two dominant players in the market, Sony and Nintendo, he said. But if Microsoft ever decides to abandon the venture, he said, Flextronics probably has the balance to bounce back from such a debacle better than Nvidia. ''For Flex, within a quarter or two, it could make acquisitions that would make up for or exceed what it loses with Xbox,'' Mr. Bernstein said. ''It's a conservative man's way to play the Xbox.''"

                "SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 12— Imagine your blender breaking down twice. The vacuum cleaner giving up the ghost three times. The espresso maker repeatedly going kaput. Then imagine replacing the item with the same model over and over while keeping your brand loyalty and sanity. Stephano Nevarez can. Since he first bought his $400 Microsoft Xbox 360 in 2006, it has failed three times. Each time, he sent the game machine back to the company and waited weeks for a repair or a replacement. “There’s nothing in the house that breaks down as much,” said Stephano, a 15-year-old high school student from Salem, Ore. Yet he remains a devotee of his 360 console, the more so because he wants to play Halo 3, the latest iteration of a violent space epic due in stores on Sept. 25; it is available only for that game machine.  The game, published by Microsoft, could redeem the company going into the holiday selling season. Untold numbers of 360 owners have watched their machines break down, and then, in many cases, watched the replacement consoles do the exact same thing because of a severe and widespread manufacturing flaw.  But if the Xbox players keep coming back because of Halo 3, and if other gamers buy the console just for the game, then Microsoft could markedly improve its standing in its battle against rivals Sony and Nintendo.  “Halo 3 is Microsoft’s most important game,” said Dan Hsu, editor in chief of Electronic Gaming Monthly, a magazine for enthusiasts. Mr. Hsu, who has seen the game, said it delivers in spades, with one caveat: “Assuming your machine does work, it does what it sets out to do.” The bar is high. Combined, Halo and Halo 2 have sold around 15 million units, making the series one of the most successful game franchises of all time. The game has spawned novels, comic books and a possible movie. The $12.5 billion console and video game business is up for grabs this year. On the console side, Nintendo is off to an unexpectedly strong start with its Wii, a game system that makes its players get up off the couch and move their bodies to direct action.  It has well over 28 percent of the American console market, according to NPD Group, a market analysis firm. The Wii is currently selling at a faster pace than the 360, and the company is releasing its big games this fall, Super Mario Galaxy and Super Smash Bros. Brawl, though neither is as popular as Halo.  Sony, with about 14 percent of the market, was hurt when the release date of Grand Theft Auto IV, a game it was counting on to increase console sales, was pushed back from October into the second quarter of next year.  Microsoft, which has 57 percent of the market, has declined to say what is causing some of its Xbox 360 to stop working, or how many machines have been affected. It has set aside $1.1 billion for repairs, a figure that suggests to industry analysts that the problem could affect a third of the 11.6 million 360s already in the hands of consumers. Microsoft has said that it will fix any faulty Xbox 360 free of charge. The most likely explanation of where the engineers went wrong is that the 360s are poorly designed to deal with the intense heat generated by game play and that computer chips and other electronics may be popping off the motherboard, said Richard Doherty, an analyst with the Envisioneering Group, a technology assessment and market research firm. Mr. Doherty said he thinks that Microsoft, in an effort to put is machine into the market a year ahead of the Sony PlayStation 3, had skimped on product testing. He said that the failure rate among 360s is almost unheard-of among consumer electronics, where having even 1 percent or 2 percent of machines fail is considered a major problem. He has been doing surveys of video game consumers, and results suggest that their patience is waning and that news of the problems is dissuading some potential buyers, he said. Even die-hard users, he said, are wondering why they cannot take their machine to a store to have it checked out, rather than wait for it to break. “It’s dissipating a tremendous amount of momentum they built up prior to July,” Mr. Doherty said, referring to when Microsoft first publicly discussed its $1.1 billion repair fund. “This is going to get worse before it gets better.” But some financial analysts said that the eventual damage to reputation and revenue may not be so profound. Evan Wilson, an equity analyst with Pacific Crest Securities, said he thought that Microsoft’s fix-it-free policy had mollified many avid game players who have been among the first to purchase the 360. Aaron Greenberg, group product manager for Xbox 360, said the repair campaign is aggressive and that the company, while it is not discussing what has gone wrong, is not taking the failures lightly. “It’s our equivalent of the Blue Screen of Death people talk about with Windows,” he said, referring to the derogatory vernacular used to describe what happens when a PC running Microsoft’s operating system mysteriously stops working. In the case of the Xbox 360, affected users have taken to calling the problem the Three Red Rings of Death. That’s because when the 360 dies, three lights on the front of the console blink red. “It started getting really loud,” said Michael White, 27, of Montreal, a high school teacher, who said his system died in April. “You expect somebody’s expensive product to be more durable than that.” Is he infuriated? Not really. “I’m a happy customer,” he said, given it only took three weeks to repair and he likes the games on the system. Others are feeling slightly less generous — or, at least, their spouses are. “My wife told me she didn’t want me to buy anymore Microsoft consoles,” said Joshua Bridges, an accountant in Spring, Tex. “But I told her I’m a huge fan of the games that come out for this platform.” Chief among his interests is Halo 3. He said he likes the fast-twitch action, but particularly the story, which involves soldiers battling against an alien race called the Covenant for control of a destructive force called the Halo. Halo 3 is the last in a trilogy. When it comes out on Sept. 25, the avid fans will be waiting in line at video game retailers across the country. More than one million units have already been ordered.  For the last three years, a team of 250 full-time and part-time designers and engineers at Bungie Studios, the development house that is owned by Microsoft, have been assembling Halo 3, said Frank O’Connor, the game’s head writer. (He declined to say how much money they spent on the game). Developers felt enormous pressure, he said, and he hopes this version will be the most popular ever, particularly given new features, like the ability of players to record and make short movies of the action they just played. “Instead of being able to say: remember the time I did that one thing? Now they’ll be able to save it and show it,” Mr. O’Connor said. One question is whether it can help Microsoft sell more consoles to mainstream consumers, or to those who may be concerned about the reliability of the 360 systems. But there is little doubt the faithful will be there in force, and thrilled about it, having forgiven Microsoft for the flaws in its console. “I’m on my third 360,” said Benjamin Lin, an 18-year-old Halo enthusiast from Seattle, “and it’s working great for me.”"

                "Ethan Thomas is an F.B.I. agent hunting serial killers and Kameo is a princess who must save her family, but both have a much more important objective: to persuade gamers to spend $300 on Microsoft's new game console, the Xbox 360. Ethan and Kameo are among the first wave of video-game protagonists for the 360. Ethan stars in Monolith's action-horror game Condemned: Criminal Origins as a G-man on the trail of the man who framed him for murder. The search has Ethan creeping, flashlight in hand, through a series of abandoned buildings populated by violent junkies and, later on, humanoid creatures that skitter along the ground. To survive you have to improvise weapons, arming yourself with a mannequin arm, a piece of steam pipe or the blade from a paper cutter, although from time to time you find a handy fire ax or even a gun loaded with a handful of bullets. Your attackers are smart, hiding behind pillars to ambush you. You can paralyze one with your Taser and grab his weapon, but your foe will immediately rearm by pulling a pipe off a wall or grabbing a table leg. Combat is well done and exciting, but other parts of the game are annoying. The biggest aggravation is locating specific weapons to get through doors; an ax breaks through a wooden door, but only a shovel can snap open the lock on a metal gate. Movement is slow; you can sprint short distances but generally are forced to walk, which creates tension when you enter a room but is infuriating when you just want to quickly run through the halls to find a shovel. To make things worse, by default sprinting is initiated by the awkward method of pushing the left analog stick on the controller, although you can assign sprint to the left trigger, which then forces you to use the left analog stick for blocking attacks. Someone should be hit a couple of times in the head with a mannequin arm for that decision. Like Monolith's recent shooter F.E.A.R., Condemned has an intriguing premise that completely falls apart by the end, but while the game's designers should consider taking a few writing classes, they really know how to scare people. It is wonderfully creepy to walk through a deserted, ruined shopping mall as Christmas Muzak endlessly plays. The game is also creepy in another way; you spend much of it essentially beating homeless people to death with pipes. Admittedly, these people attack you, and in fact will often attack and kill one another if you just get out of their way, but I still found it disturbing. Depicting homeless junkies as subhuman monsters unsettles me, although this is less of an issue later in the game as your enemies become increasingly grotesque. It is less disquieting to battle the trolls and rock creatures that populate Rare's considerably lighter action-adventure game Kameo: Elements of Power, in which the titular hero is able to transform herself into a variety of useful creatures. After her family is kidnapped by a troll king in league with her evil sister, Kameo's rescue attempt ends abruptly with the loss of the elemental powers that allow her to transform. The powers, each represented by a cute creature held captive by a shadow demon, must be freed one by one. With each rescue Kameo gains the ability to become that creature and use its powers to access new areas of the game. As the yetilike beast Chilla she can climb ice walls, while as a living ball called Major Ruin she can roll up ramps. Kameo can also use special, hard-to-find flowers to upgrade her creature's powers; the dragon Ash proved extremely useful in battles after I gained the power to release fire tornadoes to suck in enemies. Kameo is generally enjoyable but hampered by awkward controls; it is difficult to aim projectiles, and the underwater levels in which you must use Kameo's aquatic incarnation Deep Blue are utterly painful as you laboriously try to steer through the water and desperately try to aim water missiles in the right direction. The game also has an incredibly annoying help system. The hints it gives are useful, but the game won't shut up about them. As you play, a voice constantly repeats that help is available, as if even after being told the first 100 times the designers were convinced you would forget. You can make the voice shut up by turning off hints, but then when you need help you have to go into options and turn hints on, then turn them off again after, so you don't have to listen to the game blather on. Kameo is most notable for its gorgeously rendered graphics. The 360's processing power allows for many nice visual effects and lets the game put an amazing number of objects on screen. It is stunning the first time the camera pulls back from a troll battle to show what seem to be thousands of soldiers grappling. Kameo is among the most graphically advanced console games on the market, yet I was considerably more entranced this month by Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King, a turn-based role-playing game developed by Level 5 for the aging PlayStation 2 console. With a simple, pastoral cartoon style reminiscent of the films of Hayao Miyazaki and a lovely symphonic score, Dragon has a low-key charm and humor that trump cutting-edge graphics. Dragon is the episodic tale of a band of adventurers searching for the evil sorcerer Dhoulmagus. Following reports of the sorcerer, they travel from town to town, along the way helping the occasional distressed stranger. As with any role-playing game, most of your time is spent fighting off random monster attacks. Enemies tend to be more goofy than frightening; and you will face cat monsters that occasionally stop attacking to lick themselves, or giant frogs that turn around to reveal that their backsides are long-tongued demonic faces that attack by licking. Your party fights with weapons and magic, although each member can learn some other interesting skills. One female character can stop a monster from attacking by throwing a kiss, paralyzing it with desire. There's nothing especially original in Dragon's old-fashioned gameplay, but it does it all beautifully. The game also works hard to root out the most annoying traits of role-playing games. Unlike games in which you spend an hour fighting monsters, gaining better weaponry and skills only to die in a big battle and lose all your progress, in this game the death of everyone in your party simply results in the loss of some gold and your return to the nearest town. The game offers shortcuts to previously visited locales and a way to exit dungeons instantly. Dragon has witty dialogue, interesting characters and engaging battles, yet for me it is perhaps most notable for being one of the least annoying role-playing games ever made. Dragon proves that, while the 360 is a beautiful machine whose elegant design and raw power easily best the competition, you don't really need it. If you have an Xbox 360, Kameo and Condemned are both worth playing, but neither is essential. Great games come when game designers know a platform well enough to concentrate on their vision rather than the technology, so expect the best 360 games to turn up in a few years. Just around the time Microsoft comes out with a brand-new console.

                "The transition to a new generation of video game consoles kicks off tonight at midnight when retailers begin selling Microsoft's Xbox 360. The event is a much-anticipated step in an intensifying business battle between Microsoft, a relative newcomer to the video game industry, and Sony and Nintendo. Sony plans to release its own successor console, PlayStation 3, in the spring, while Nintendo is expected to follow later in 2006. The new consoles are, in general, considerably more powerful than their predecessors, but they will be more expensive, as will the games made to be played on them. The high-end version of the Xbox 360 is priced at $399 and the basic version at $299, though some enthusiasts are not blinking. \"I'll be there at midnight,\" said Ibe Ozobia Jr., 31, who said he planned to pick up his new Xbox at a local retailer in Las Vegas, where he lives. Mr. Ozobia placed an advance order for the console in June, making sure he would not miss out if there is a shortage. And, he said, he likes to be on the cutting edge. \"I can't deal with old technology,\" said Mr. Ozobia, who works in technical support at a computer company and spends 30 hours a week playing video games. For Microsoft, the challenge is whether it can build its base of consumers beyond the hard-core game players that supported the first version of the Xbox, which came out in 2001. A key to Microsoft's success is whether there will be enough mainstream video games to attract a range of consumers to the console, industry analysts said. Analysts have said it is too soon to say whether that is the case, though they consider the number of games available at the outset, 18, to be relatively healthy. Some Wall Street analysts said they were puzzled by the question of how many consoles would be immediately available for sale. Microsoft has declined to comment about its supply, leaving analysts to estimate that there are two million to three million to be distributed in North America, Europe and Japan. Sales in Europe begin on Dec. 3, and in Japan on Dec. 10. Microsoft has said that within 90 days, it expects to ship 2.75 million to 3 million consoles worldwide. Wall Street analysts expect a shortage in the United States, with some saying Microsoft has purposely stoked demand beyond the company's ability to meet it. Indeed, some stores have already sold out their allotment through advance orders and Internet sales. GameStop, the nation's biggest video game specialty retailer with 3,500 stores, sold out its initial order two weeks ago. Individual stores have been calling consumers, telling them to show up within 48 hours of the introduction or risk forfeiting their console and receiving a refund, said Chris Olivera, a GameStop spokesman. Microsoft is \"trying to turn this into the Cabbage Patch Kids,\" said Michael Pachter, an analyst with Wedbush Morgan Securities. He said he expected Microsoft to constantly publicize stories of stores that were sold out to inspire press coverage and water-cooler talk of when the next shipment would arrive. \"It's brilliant marketing.\" Molly O'Donnell, a Microsoft spokeswoman, said the company was not trying to pique demand by holding down supply or withholding inventory from retailers. \"The reality is that our manufacturing facilities are running at full capacity and churning out as many consoles as humanly possible,\" Ms. O'Donnell said."

                "LOS ANGELES — The latest video game consoles can play Internet radio, Netflix movies and YouTube video clips. But Sony and Microsoft, gearing up for a blistering battle in retail stores this holiday season, are reassuring consumers that their consoles are very much about games, too. That message was particularly forceful from Microsoft at the annual Electronic Entertainment Expo, or E3, game convention here, where the biggest companies in the games business show many of the products they will release later in the year. A year ago, Microsoft was promoting its Xbox One as an all-in-one entertainment system for the living room, one that could play games and then seamlessly shift to let people watch television, and change the channels with voice commands. On Monday, though, Microsoft shifted the conversation decisively back to games, announcing a lineup of almost two dozen titles, many of them hard-core shooting games, to be released on the Xbox this year, including an anthology of classic games based on the Halo science-fiction shooter series. “Our goal is to make Xbox One the best place to play games in this generation,” said Phil Spencer, the head of Microsoft’s Xbox business, who received vigorous applause when he declared that Microsoft would dedicate the event entirely to games. While the change in emphasis may seem subtle, it comes after Microsoft was forced to respond to the success of Sony, its main competitor in the games business. Both companies introduced their new game systems in November, but Sony’s PlayStation 4 has held a decisive lead on Microsoft from the beginning. Microsoft said Monday that the company has sold more than five million Xbox Ones. Last month, Sony said it has sold more than seven million PlayStation 4s. At its own event Monday evening, Sony revealed its own slate of upcoming games for the PlayStation 4, including Little Big Planet 3, a new version of a popular adventure game with a character called Sackboy. Sony also said Grand Theft Auto V, a huge hit released previously for older consoles, will be released on the PlayStation 4 in the fall. It will also be published for Xbox One and PCs. Andrew House, the president and chief executive of Sony Computer Entertainment, said the company’s vision is to make sure that its console is “above all else the place to play.” But Sony placed a spotlight on its broader entertainment ambitions, too. The company said it would produce original television content that will be streamed over the Internet to its console, including a show based on “Powers,” a graphic novel about two homicide detectives who investigate superheroes. Microsoft has announced similar plans for original shows. Sony has also sought to out-innovate Microsoft with plans, announced previously, to develop a virtual reality headset, called Project Morpheus, that will immerse PlayStation 4 players in 3-D worlds. Part of Microsoft’s disadvantage came from being more ambitious about the technology in the Xbox One, which includes the Kinect camera and microphone device. The Kinect allows people to play games and operate other functions with body movements and voice commands, and has been included with the console. The extra technology translated into a $499 price tag for the Xbox One, $100 more than for the PlayStation 4. Sony deftly exploited that and other missteps by Microsoft to portray itself as the more gamer-friendly console maker. In response, Microsoft recently announced it planned to introduce a $399 console without Kinect, which went on sale Monday. “They’re back on message,” said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, referring to the change in Microsoft’s emphasis. Game developers still seem eager to create products for Microsoft’s system. The company and its partners showed new versions of “Assassin’s Creed” and “Call of Duty,” two blockbuster franchises that are likely to be big sellers this holiday season. One of the most enthusiastic responses Microsoft got was for the Halo anthology, “Halo: The Masterchief Collection,” which will allow people to play four older installments of the series on the Xbox One console with improved graphics. Microsoft will not release an entirely new version of Halo, known as “Halo 5: Guardians,” until next year. But Microsoft said people purchasing the anthology would be able to participate in a test of the multiplayer abilities of the new game later this year. Microsoft showed another exclusive Xbox game called “Sunset Overdrive,” a kinetic shooting game set in an apocalyptic urban landscape populated by mutants. Sony and Microsoft have both enjoyed strong sales of their new systems, partly because a third competitor, Nintendo, has struggled with its latest console, the Wii U. All three are being forced to adapt to a market where smartphones and tablets are becoming the most common devices for playing games. In an interview, Mr. Spencer of Microsoft commended Sony for its strong showing since it introduced the PlayStation 4. He said he had no intention of allowing his competitor to keep a lead on Microsoft. “I’m in this to win,” he said."

                "Josh Roberts got his first video game system — Atari — when he was 4, and since then, “I’ve had all the latest and greatest systems,” said Mr. Roberts, 27, an advertising account executive. The roster includes various versions of Nintendo, Sega and Sony PlayStation, the original Microsoft Xbox and now its latest iteration, Xbox 360.   Last year when Mr. Roberts moved with his wife from Los Angeles to Memphis, he didn’t have cable for several months. So he began using his Xbox 360 for something more than his standard fare of games like Guitar Hero II and Madden NFL: he downloaded episodes of his beloved “South Park” as well as the occasional movie in high definition, for fees running from $2 to $6 through Xbox LIVE Marketplace, the emporium accessed through the console’s interface.  “I’ll sometimes also look and see what the top downloads are and check them out too,” he said.   With the continued rise of video gaming — sales of the Xbox 360 have hit 10 million — consumers in that highly prized demographic of males from 18 to 24 are being drawn away from the entertainment provided by the small screen and the multiplex. To bring them back to the fold — and to compete with Apple’s iTunes — Microsoft and its content providers, among them Paramount Pictures, New Line, Warner Brothers, MTV, CBS, A&E and ABC are engaged in some serious outreach.  “We need to find viewers wherever they are,” said Michele Ganeless, the executive vice president and general manager of Comedy Central. “Some of them are firing up their Xbox rather than their cable box. They have so many entertainment options. Being on Xbox is a perfect way for us to reach them in their own environment.”  Since late last November, through the console interface and a points card available in $5 increments from chains like Best Buy, Xbox LIVE Marketplace has offered video-on-demand downloads of movies, often in high definition, and download-to-own episodes of television shows. Microsoft declined to give revenue figures for the service, but claims it has grown by double-digit figures each month since it was introduced. Membership at the basic level is free and as simple as signing up on iTunes.  “We allow a consumer who’s very engaged in games to shift, with the same box, to watching ‘The Departed,’ ” said Ross Honey, senior director of the media entertainment group at Microsoft, referring to Martin Scorsese’s Oscar-winning movie.   Xbox LIVE Marketplace also has some exclusive content, for example, a no-cost high-definition version of a “South Park” episode and some first-look content. Before “The Sarah Silverman Program” appeared on Comedy Central, the first episode was available free in the Marketplace.  There’s a similar plan in place for “American Body Shop,” a series that begins on Comedy Central on July 8; starting yesterday, its premiere episode was available for free download to Xbox LIVE’s more than six million members.   The service currently offers more than 2,000 hours of programming. To prevent piracy, consumers have 24 hours to watch rented material before it is automatically expunged from the console’s hard drive.   “The people we’ve partnered with see this as a good way to re-connect with the consumer,” said Mr. Honey.  For example, the high-definition “South Park” episode which has, thus far, been downloaded almost 400,000 times, contained a message urging viewers to watch for the series’ new season. Warner Brothers promoted the theatrical release of the film “300” on the Marketplace interface.   “We’ve seen tremendous results,” said Michele Edelman, vice president of marketing for Warner Brothers digital distribution whose offerings include current television shows like “Supernatural” and “One Tree Hill,” classic fare like “CHiPs” “The Dukes of Hazzard,” “Scooby Doo” “Yogi Bear,” as well as movies.  And some platforms encourage their own hits. When Warner released “Beerfest” to the rental market, the gross-out comedy became the No. 1 offering on the VOD Xbox platform, according to Ms. Edelman.  “It might be buried in a video store, and on Xbox it’s been able to rise to the top,” she said.  The visual sophistication of gamers is such that they are largely unsatisfied by traditional television broadcasts, said James L. McQuivey, a principal analyst at Forrester Research. “It’s very smart of Microsoft to realize, ‘We’ve got the customers, we already have an Internet connection for millions of boxes, let’s see what other visual treats we can feed them.’ ”  Mr. McQuivey added, “From all the data I’ve seen behind closed doors, it does work.”   What is good for Xbox’s best consumer, the young male gaming enthusiast, Mr. Honey hopes will be good for other segments of the population.  The goal is to broaden the consumer base with younger offerings like Nickelodeon’s animated series “Fairly OddParents.” According to Mr. Honey, Microsoft did a brisk business with a high-definition version of “Happy Feet” when a few weeks ago it was added to the offerings on the service.  “We absolutely believe that ‘Happy Feet’ being available brought families to use Xbox in a way they haven’t used it before,” he said. “And when you bring them there, they start to browse around.”  Indeed, Mr. Roberts of Memphis says that although his wife does not play video games at all, “the movie and TV service on ‘Live’ has her using the Xbox. Because of the service she knows how to navigate the user interface to download the content she wants.”   Anita Frazier, an industry analyst for the NPD Group, a sales and marketing research firm, says Xbox’s expansion of services makes sense.  “It’s where entertainment delivery is headed. It’s a natural evolution for any of these boxes, whether it’s a computer or an Xbox or a PlayStation 3 or Apple TV to deliver a variety of content and whether it’s games or music or TV or movies.”  But, she added, “a lot of it is going to hinge on the user interface and how easy it is to accomplish the downloads.” Not always so easy, according to Mr. McQuivey. “The movie feature as currently arranged is no better than traditional video on demand. The titles are hard to find,” he said, adding, “There are operational things that need to be resolved before they can take it to the next level.”   Mr. Roberts has downloaded a few high-definition movies and “it took hours,” he said. “I don’t think the broadband technology is there yet.” He also finds the Microsoft points card (80 points equals one dollar) an annoying and slightly confusing system.  “It’s like at a carnival where you need two tickets to buy a drink and three tickets to buy a hot dog,” he said. “I’d rather know what I’m paying, and I’d like to see that transaction made in dollars rather than points.”   Xbox LIVE Marketplace, he added, “is not yet at a place where I think it’s made my life easier or more entertaining in my leisure time, but I’m excited for the potential. When it moves faster and the bandwidth is great, then I think it will be very cool.”"

                "There are few places online not full of advertising, but Xbox Live, the Microsoft broadband network that lets Xbox game console owners compete online, is one of them. This week Cadillac will announce that it has struck an advertising deal to incorporate some of its cars in the Xbox 360 game, Project Gotham Racing 3. Virtual recreations of three of its high-performance models -- the CTS-V, the STS-V and the XLR-V -- will be made available as free downloads. Deals like this also represent another source of revenue for video games, many of which now have the online connectivity that can allow advertisers to monitor the viewership of their messages. Cadillac is one of the first companies to advertise on Xbox Live. But Kevin Browne, the Microsoft general manager for Xbox new media and franchise development, said that the company expected to announce between 10 and 20 such deals over the next year. Earlier this month, Microsoft announced that it had acquired Massive, a company that sells ads in games. The Cadillac deal was put together by Play, the video game unit of Denuo, a division of the ad giant Publicis Group that focuses on new media. \"It's another model to distribute advertising,\" said Michael Goodman, a senior analyst at the Yankee Group. He said that the market for advertising in video games was $56 million in 2005, a number he expected to triple this year. For years, racing video games have incorporated increasingly accurate representations of actual cars, which are able to accelerate and handle on the screen the way they do on the road. Software makers usually pay a royalty for the right to use a vehicle's likeness, even though inclusion in a popular game can generate a certain amount of awareness in the young, male audience. In Project Gotham, players who score top times on the Nürburgring, a race track in Germany that Cadillac has used to test vehicles, will receive a \"Cadillac Elite\" status to show off to fellow gamers and perhaps eventually use to receive other prizes. \"But it would be a mistake to capitalize on this space without taking advantage of it,\" said Saneel Radia, a group director of Play. \"The fact that other people are looking at it creates an aspirational value for Cadillac.\" ROBERT LEVINE"

                "AMONG other new features, the new Toyota Yaris has a giant tentacle that reaches out of its roof to shoot enemies as it races through a futuristic tunnel, sometimes within inches of soaring fireballs. The tentacle is not standard on the new models: this Yaris car was devised by a video game company rather than automobile engineers.  The shooting car is the central character of a new Xbox game called Yaris that Toyota will introduce today. The game will be offered free to all Xbox 360 console owners in the United States and Canada, who can download it from Xbox Live’s service. It is also the first Xbox game created by an advertiser to be distributed over Xbox Live.  Like scores of other consumer brand companies, Toyota is increasingly creating its own content like video games rather than relying simply on advertising during commercial breaks. “People can time shift, they can do all sorts of different things to avoid advertising,” said Kim McCullough, corporate manager for marketing communications at Toyota. “That’s why we have to move beyond traditional advertising to do things that are really engaging for people.” Toyota introduced the Yaris, a moderately priced subcompact, in the spring of 2006, and has focused its advertising on young consumers. Yaris is not the first brand to advertise through custom-made video games.  Two years ago, Volvo introduced an Xbox game that emphasizes safe driving; it was given away at dealerships. Doritos ran a contest (www.unlockxbox.com) this summer for Xbox game ideas, and the top five ideas are being produced by professionals.  Advertisers are also increasingly buying product placement space within games rather than creating their own. Advertisers in the United States will spend $502 million on video game advertising this year, up from $346 million last year, according to eMarketer, a research firm. Just over half of that is in the form of ads placed within games, and the rest is for marketers to create their own games, known in the industry as advergames. Advertisers generally view video game fans as people who are hard to reach and do not like commercial messages, said Shahid Khan, a partner at IBB Consulting Group, a media consulting firm. “This group does not want to be advertised to,” Mr. Khan said. “It has to be a really good game. If it is a really good video game, then it won’t matter if it was made by an advertiser.” Of course, advertisers might have trouble competing with the popularity of Xbox games like Halo 3, which was released last month. Within a week, Microsoft announced that the game had more than $300 million in sales, a high level for any game.  Burger King’s Sneak King Xbox game introduced last fall has become perhaps the most well-known advergame. Customers can buy the game for $3.99 at Burger King restaurants (with the purchase of a BK value meal). About 3.5 million games have been sold, according to Burger King. Using Xbox data on game use, the Burger King game equates in time spent to more than 1.4 billion 30-second commercials, the fast-food company says. “Interacting with our characters in the games is actually more engaging than just sitting back in your chair and watching a Super Bowl commercial,” said Russ Klein, president for global marketing for Burger King.  Mr. Klein cautioned that giving a game away, as Toyota is doing, might cause people to be suspicious of the game’s quality. Games in the Xbox Live Arcade section, where the Yaris game will be available, normally cost $5 to $15 a download.  The idea and game design for the Yaris game came from Toyota’s advertising agency, Saatchi & Saatchi L.A., which outsourced production to Backbone Entertainment, a division of Foundation 9 Entertainment. Backbone is perhaps best known for creating the Sonic the Hedgehog games. Toyota is spending in the low millions for the campaign, which includes paying Microsoft to promote it and developing the game at a cost higher than typical casual games. “The level of finish on this is really polished. It had to be,” said Harvey Marco, executive creative director at Saatchi & Saatchi L.A., which is part of the Publicis Groupe. “It’s not overt branding. It’s called the Yaris game, it’s about driving the Yaris around, but we’re not coming out and throwing taglines into the game.” Past campaigns for the Yaris have also centered on emerging technologies. Yaris sponsored short cellphone episodes of Fox’s “Prison Break” last year and ran ads in the game Anarchy Online. Players earned “power-up” points in the game by watching Yaris ads on billboards. "

                "Rockstar Games, maker of the wildly popular and highly controversial Grand Theft Auto series of video games, right, announced yesterday that a new installment of the series is in development for Microsoft's Xbox 360 game console and Sony's PlayStation 3. The announcement came one day before the world's largest video-game convention, known as E3, opens in Los Angeles. As gamers and industry executives from around the globe have descended on Los Angeles, the potential development of a new Grand Theft Auto has been widely rumored, yet yesterday's confirmation is sure to become one of the main topics of discussion on the show floor. (But it appears unlikely that Rockstar will demonstrate any elements of the game at the convention.) The announcement was a blow to Sony because previous versions of Grand Theft Auto have had their debuts exclusively on PlayStation 2, which has helped sell the Sony machines. This time, Rockstar is making Grand Theft Auto for the Xbox 360 simultaneously with the Sony version. In addition, Peter Moore, corporate vice president for Microsoft's games business, announced at Microsoft's E3 news conference that Rockstar would be making add-ons for Grand Theft Auto IV available by download over Microsoft's Xbox Live service. The game is to arrive in October 2007. SETH SCHIESEL"

                "SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 22 - Around 2:30 a.m. Tuesday, Mike La was scoping out a darkened Target store in nearby Daly City, Calif., on his Honda motorcycle when a police officer pulled up. The officer knew exactly what was going on. \"He asked, 'Are you here to buy an Xbox 360?' \" Mr. La, 23, recalled later. When Mr. La said that was his intention, the officer pointed him to another part of the building where a line of customers waited for the store to open. The much-publicized transition to the next generation of video game consoles began Tuesday morning as stores across the country started selling Microsoft's Xbox 360, the powerful new machine that is already the must-have of the season for hard-core game players. They gathered in the rain in Manhattan, where a Best Buy opened its doors at midnight. They stood in line all night at chain stores like Target. Mr. La, a car salesman in San Francisco, had preordered one Xbox 360 from a local EB Games store, which he picked up at midnight. Then he waited in line to buy a second one at a nearby CompUSA store, after deciding not to wait at the Target. He said he was hoping that stores would sell out of their initial supplies and he could make a profit selling his second machine. \"I think I can get at least $800 for it,\" Mr. La said of the system, which costs $399 in stores. Microsoft has declined to say how many consoles it is making available this holiday season. But it has said that it expects to have shipped 2.75 million to 3 million units within 90 days. The excitement among hard-core gamers, partly generated by the limited supply, is precisely what Microsoft is hoping for as it tries to build momentum in the bruising game console business, which has been dominated by Sony. Microsoft expects the Xbox 360 to provide serious competition to Sony's next-generation console, the PlayStation 3, which is due out next spring. Industry analysts and executives said the early buzz around the Xbox 360 might not mean much in the long term. Analysts have widely expected Microsoft to sell out its early, limited supplies of the console, but to eventually sell 10 million of them with relative ease. The real question for Microsoft is whether the 360 can outsell the first version of the Xbox, which came out in 2001 and has sold about 22 million worldwide, compared with about 90 million for PlayStation 2 Paul-Jon McNealy, a video game industry analyst with American Technology Research, said the real measures of Microsoft's success might not be clear until the 2007 holiday season. At that point, he said both Microsoft and PlayStation 3 will have been in the market for more than a year, and will be vying head-to-head for mainstream game players. Evan Wilson, an analyst for Pacific Crest Securities, said the long-term measure of success would depend on whether there were any big hit games for the Xbox 360 that succeeded in drawing mainstream consumers to the console. For customers on Tuesday, the long term did not matter. \"I wanted to be one of the first, if not the first, to have the Xbox 360,\" said Peter Gonzalez, 19, a sophomore at the College of Staten Island, who was the first in line at a Best Buy in Manhattan. He had arrived at 7:30 p.m. on Sunday night and by the time the store opened, he was shivering under an umbrella in the rain. But he said he was elated, and even got a cheer from employees after he made his purchase and left the store. Anthony Cintron, 26, was feeling less buoyant. He arrived in line at 6 a.m. Monday, and by the evening he was feeling cold, wet and under-appreciated. \"My wife thinks I'm nuts and my kids are sleeping,\" said Mr. Cintron, an employee at an elevator business in Long Island City, Queens. \"My feet hurt, I'm cold, but it's worth it.\" For Mr. La, in San Francisco, the results were mixed. He said he felt good about owning the new console, and was optimistic about selling the second one at a profit. But there was just one small downside: after playing Perfect Dark, a shooting game, for about 30 minutes, he concluded the machine was not quite as much fun as he had hoped. \"There was too much hype,\" he said."

                "A video game that depicts a battle between corporate mercenaries and local brigands in far-off space colonies has already won the hearts and minds of Microsoft executives. Now those Microsoft bosses hope the game, Titanfall, will win over enough consumers to pump up sales of Xbox One, the company’s flagship gaming console. Xbox One sales are trailing those of a machine from Sony, Microsoft’s main rival. There is reason to be hopeful: Titanfall was created by a well-known game designer and has already received critical acclaim. In an unusual move for a major title created by an independent game maker, Titanfall is being released exclusively for three Microsoft platforms — the Xbox One, the older Xbox 360 console and Windows PCs. “It’s hard to understate how incredibly important Titanfall is for Xbox,” Yusuf Mehdi, chief marketing and strategy officer for devices and studios at Microsoft, said in an interview. While the Xbox is a relatively small portion of Microsoft’s business, it is crucial to the company’s future as its most prominent hardware success and the linchpin of its strategy to influence the future of entertainment. Microsoft is betting that an exciting game that can be played only on Microsoft products will persuade more people to spend $500 on an Xbox One, $100 more than for Sony’s latest console, the PlayStation 4. In a sign of how heavily Microsoft is counting on Titanfall to lift the sales of its new console, the company said recently that it would bundle the game with the Xbox One while keeping the price for the two at $500, the same amount it previously charged for the console alone. The move was effectively a $60 price cut for the Xbox One since that it is how much Titanfall will sell for on its own. Price is the biggest disadvantage Microsoft has against the PS4. Microsoft’s console costs more because it includes the Kinect camera and microphone sensor with every system. The sensor is designed to let people play games without a conventional controller and to operate nongame functions on the console, like changing cable channels with their voices. Titanfall is due in stores this week after two years of development.  Early reviews have been positive, and its creative chief, Vince Zampella of Respawn Entertainment, has a strong track record. He helped create the wildly successful Call of Duty game series, which has had revenue of more than $9 billion during its 11-year history. If the game is the hit many people in the industry expect, Titanfall could repeat the success of another big game, Halo. That science-fiction shooter, which is owned and still published by Microsoft, ignited a fire under sales of the original Xbox. Since Halo was released in 2001, more than 60 million copies have been sold. As another science-fiction shooting game, Titanfall resembles Halo, at least superficially. But Respawn has put a fresh spin on the concept. And as inexpensive mobile games soak up more time from players, the game is also an opportunity for a big-budget console game, with eye-popping effects and a monopoly over the biggest screen in the house, to reassert itself and its genre. “Titanfall will help propel the idea of high-definition gaming,” said Patrick Soderlund, the executive vice president of EA Studios at Electronic Arts, the company that is publishing the game for Respawn. Titanfall is meant to be played only online with other players, in contrast to other modern games that allow people to play both online and by themselves. This dovetails well with Microsoft’s strategy of giving people more reasons to subscribe to a premium version of Xbox Live, a paid service that is required for people who want to play games against others online. Microsoft is using Xbox Live, which costs $60 a year, to deliver video programming from Netflix, Comcast and a bounty of other media partners. People can play Titanfall as soldiers on foot, outfitted with a variety of weapons that they use to defend themselves amid the ruins of a ravaged planet.  They can leap across chasms by running on walls, parkour style. The most exciting moments occur when players decide to hop into giant robotic suits, known in the game as titans, which they can pilot around, picking off opponents with heavy weaponry. “It was a little bit of trying to do something familiar yet different,” Mr. Zampella of Respawn said. The high hopes for Titanfall stem partly from the pedigree of Mr. Zampella, 44, and Jason West, the co-founders of Infinity Ward, the studio behind Call of Duty, which Activision acquired in 2003. They were forced out of the studio by Activision in 2010 in a dispute over money. Lawsuits between both sides were eventually settled. Respawn, based in Van Nuys, Calif., has about 70 game developers, about half of whom used to work at Infinity Ward, Mr. Zampella said. Mr. West, who co-founded Respawn with Mr. Zampella, left the studio last year. In deciding to make Titanfall exclusive for Microsoft systems, Respawn and Electronic Arts are probably forgoing the opportunity to sell millions of copies of the game for PlayStation. The benefits of their deal, whose financial terms Mr. Zampella, EA and Microsoft declined to disclose, are widely believed to include hefty financial contributions by Microsoft to develop the game. “Microsoft is going to push us because they see us as a game for selling their system,” Mr. Zampella said. Still, Microsoft has to persuade gamers that the Xbox One is worth the extra cost. The first wave of games after the system went on sale in November did not fully showcase the benefits of the Kinect, and Titanfall will not either, since it does not rely on the sensor for any central elements of the game. “There are a lot of people who don’t understand what Kinect is all about,” said John Taylor, an analyst who follows game industry stocks at Arcadia Investment. Sony also deftly exploited some marketing missteps Microsoft made when it announced its console last year, including a decision to give game publishers control over whether people could sell Xbox One games on the used market. Microsoft reversed the decision after a huge outcry from gamers. But by then, Sony had used the controversy to portray itself as the more gamer-friendly system. As of March 2, Sony says consumers have bought more than six million PlayStation 4s globally. The most recent Xbox One sales figure Microsoft has provided was 3.9 million through the end of last year, though not all of those systems were bought by consumers since the figure represents Microsoft’s sales to retailers. In January, the PlayStation 4 outsold the Xbox One in the United States almost two to one, Sony said recently, citing data from the NPD Group, a retail sales tracking firm. “It’s very early in the race, but the danger is if PS4 just keeps building momentum, that could cause them a lot of trouble,” David Cole, a game analyst at DFC Intelligence, said of Microsoft. “The next nine months are really critical for Xbox One. Titanfall is huge in that respect.”"

                " NEW YORK — Microsoft said on Thursday that its second-quarter profit rose 5.5 percent, buoyed by new server software, but that revenue missed forecasts after sales of the video-game console Xbox 360fell short. Net income advanced to $3.65 billion, or 34 cents a share, from $3.46 billion, or 32 cents, a year earlier, the company said. Sales gained 9.4 percent, to $11.8 billion, missing its October forecast of $11.9 billion to $12 billion. The company shipped 1.5 million Xbox machines in the quarter.The Xbox sold out days after it went on sale on Nov. 22 in the United States after a failure to secure Xbox components limited supply. The company had pinned its hopes on holiday sales of the machines to bolster revenue and win market share from PlayStation, which is made by Sony. \"Xbox does have a material impact for Microsoft in the December quarter because of the holiday shopping season,\" said David Hilal, an analyst at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey. \"The fact it was capacity constrained in December will probably create some headwinds for their overall quarter.\" Sales also missed the $12 billion average estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial. Shares of Microsoft, which reported after the close of trading,rose 10 cents to $26.50. Revenue this quarter will be $10.9 billion to $11.2 billion, Microsoft said. Per-share earnings will be 32 cents to 33 cents. The new Windows and Office, coming this year, will anchor plans by Steve Ballmer, the company's chief executive, to buttress sales growth and win back investors who say Microsoft Google in the hottest markets such as Internet search. Profit was bolstered by rising personal-computer demand. Global PC shipments rose 17 percent in the quarter, according to the researcher IDC. That beat company forecasts of a 10 percent to 12 percent rise. Microsoft's sales may pick up in coming quarters with the release of Windows Vista, which will have new features like a built-in search engine for scouring the Web and files on PCs, and an application to organize and display photos. Nokia profit falls Nokia, the world's largest maker of mobile phones, on Thursday reported an unexpected drop in fourth-quarter profit and said cellphone prices might fall. The company also said it planned to buy back E6.5 billion worth of stock this year, Bloomberg News reported from Helsinki. Net income fell to E1.07 billion, or $1.3 billion, from E1.08 billion a year earlier. Earnings per share rose to 25 cents from 24 cents as the company bought back stock. Sales increased to E10.3 billion from E9.46 billion, Nokia's chief executive, Jorma Ollila, said at a press meeting in Espoo, Finland, where Nokia is based. Ollila, who plans to step down on June 1, announced the company's biggest-ever share buyback, underpinning a stock that fell as much as 5.1 percent after the results. Nokia said handset prices, which dropped 11 percent last year, might fall this quarter as sales increase in emerging markets. Ollila will be succeeded this year by the company's president, Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo. Jarmo Nieminen, a fund manager at Nordea in Helsinki, said that \"margins and average selling prices lagged expectations\" as the volume growth is in China and India. The forecast for phone prices \"was a disappointment, as expectations were for an increase,\" he said. Nokia is trying to lift sales and margins by selling more advanced phones in Europe and the United States and luring buyers in growth markets like India and China. Shares of Nokia fell 23 cents, or 1.5 percent, to E14.89 in Helsinki. Nokia was expected to earn E1.09 billion on sales of E10.07 billion, the median forecast of 17 analysts in a Bloomberg News survey showed. The company plans to pay a dividend of 37 cents a share for 2005, up from 33 cents a year earlier, it said in a Helsinki exchange statement. Average selling prices fell to E99 in the fourth quarter, from E102 in the preceding three months and E111 a year earlier, Nokia said. Prices will be \"flat to slightly down sequentially\" in the first quarter, Nokia said. Richard Windsor, an analyst at Nomura International in London, said that Nokia's forecast that prices may drop this quarter \"is negative, given that they have a strong product line-up.\" "

                "I went to the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last week for two main reasons: to speak on a panel about next-generation gaming and to see if Sony would say anything substantive about the PlayStation 3. The panel was over by the end of my first morning in town. By the end of the second morning -- after Sony's news conference and a speech by Sir Howard Stringer, its chairman -- it was clear that the company was intent on saying absolutely nothing significant about the PS3. (So by default, the prevailing assumption for now has to be that North American gamers won't see the machine before November; Japan will get first dibs.) The rest of the show didn't have a lot of video-game content. And so, faced with two more days before my flight out, I went looking for what so many have sought in Sin City: sex. And that's because gadget geeks aren't the only folks who have their major annual get-together in Las Vegas during the first week of January. Quite symbiotically, it seems, the multibillion-dollar sex entertainment industry stages the flashy Adult Video News Adult Entertainment Expo at the same time. That got me thinking about the debate that erupted last year when it was discovered that Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas included hidden scenes, playable only with special software, that used relatively low-resolution graphics to depict mostly clothed digital figures rubbing against each other in sexlike poses. That revelation not only made news across the country, but also propelled Democratic senators, led by Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, to introduce legislation that would have the Federal Trade Commission regulate video game sales. With sex in video games such a hot topic, I figured that the professional pornographers must be working on some pretty-far-out game projects. And so, with the full consent of my girlfriend, I went in search of the latest video games with sexual content. The first thing I realized was that there still aren't any true \"adult\" video games, as the industry calls them. By that I mean that I have never seen a product that worked primarily as an engaging video game while also incorporating X-rated content in an interesting way. Even as far back as the 1980's, the really good games with risqué themes, like the Leisure Suit Larry series and the text-only Infocom classic Leather Goddesses of Phobos, had very little actual sex in them. Instead, they relied on humor and innuendo. On the other hand, almost all sex-oriented games have just been straight-up pornography strung together with a veneer of interactivity. As far back as junior high school in the 80's, I can remember strip poker games for my Commodore computers that amounted to barely decipherable digital pictures of topless women with a few card-flipping animations thrown in. Twenty years later, the graphics and presentation are a lot better, but the idea is still mostly the same. For example, one of the highest-profile interactive products in Las Vegas last week was a DVD called Virtual Blackjack with Gina Lynn, due out this month. Evan Brimstone, the project's producer, said he worked for 18 months trying to shoehorn a playable blackjack system onto a DVD. As the player wins hands, Ms. Lynn performs various explicit scenes. The challenge facing the industry is that for any video game to break through, it really has to deliver on the game part. Otherwise, the player might as well go straight for the hardcore stuff readily available all over the Internet. Ms. Lynn seemed to perfectly grasp that the play, not the sex, is the thing. \"With a movie they don't have to work for it,\" she said, stepping away from an autograph session with fans. \"But in the game you don't get to see anything unless you win. With a game they feel like they accomplished something and they win a prize, and the prize is me. They can watch any movie just to see sex. But with a game they get to feel like they've won, and hopefully that keeps them playing.\" In the end, though, most of the games out there with sexual content are still just a matter of picking a path to follow. It is a problem familiar to Joone, founder of Digital Playground, a leader in interactive pornography since the early 1990's. Digital Playground started the popular Virtual Sex DVD series, which has included big-name porn stars like Jenna Jameson, Tera Patrick and Jill Kelly, and is now beginning to stream explicit clips to video iPod users. \"When the DVD came out it actually became harder to achieve the interactivity because with the DVD you couldn't save,\" said Joone, who uses only one name. \"You could switch camera angles and you could switch positions, but you couldn't save your experience and play it back.\" Now, with high-definition movie formats like HD-DVD and Blu-ray on the way, Joone said he hoped that the industry could create new interactive features that allowed users both to create and to save their preferred path through a film or scene. But why no real video games with sexual content on real video game systems? In the end, it is mostly because the big-name console makers are afraid of the potential backlash. While anyone can make and sell a PC game, selling a game for a living-room console requires approval from the system's manufacturer. \"We thought we would be building bigger, more sophisticated games by now like you see on PlayStation and Xbox,\" Joone said, \"but the problem is that Sony and Microsoft are the gatekeepers and they don't want it. Also, we know a lot of users would like our content on a PSP, but Sony controls that and they say that if it's hard core it's not going on the PSP. You can do soft core only.\" But despite all the warmed-over concepts, there were a few flashes of real creativity. The most interesting project I saw was a demonstration of a massively multiplayer online game called Naughty America: The Game. The graphics, which looked a lot like the Sims game, were nothing special, but the concept was fascinating: to bring together gaming and online dating. Dusty Lillo, a Naughty America spokesman, said the game was not meant for immediate sexual gratification. \"This is for people who want to form relationships,\" he said. \"This is for people who want to explore their fantasies.\" \"In World of Warcraft, you go up in levels, gain power and add equipment,\" he added. \"In our game, you add prestige by having sex with more people. But you can't tell other people who you had sex with unless both parties agree to share that information publicly.\" Mr. Lillo said the game, which is scheduled to go into online beta testing this spring, will include a strong identity-verification system. And he joined the politicians and others who have denounced Grand Theft Auto. \"Grand Theft Auto is marketed to children, and in that game you can beat women without their consent and that is unacceptable,\" he said. \"In our game you can't have sex with someone unless it's consensual. In our game, if someone doesn't like what you're doing, they can tell you to stop.\" \"Previous games with sex involved artificial intelligence, but who wants to have sex with an artificial intelligence, with a machine?\" Mr. Lillo added. \"People don't want to play games anymore unless they know there are real people on the other end. What we're doing is using a game system as the bridge to online dating. Most online dating now is on Web sites, and Web sites are so static. This is an interactive environment with a game component that lets people, men and women, actually meet each other and explore their fantasies consensually before exchanging any personal information.\" Don't be surprised if the idea works. Sex sells. Online gaming sells. Online dating sells. If Naughty America can meld the three into a workable system, perhaps then there will be an \"adult\" video game. As usual, responses are invited to thegamer@nytimes.com."

                " SAN FRANCISCO — Note to hard-core video game players: Microsoft says it is aiming for your mothers and wives. In the coming weeks, Microsoft plans to introduce a marketing campaign to expand the appeal of the new Xbox 360 game console beyond the young men who are the Xbox's biggest fans. Microsoft hopes to win a bigger share of the market from the PlayStation 2, the top-selling console made by Sony, by promoting a more family-friendly image for the new Xbox, which will be in U.S. stores starting Nov. 22.The Xbox 360 will go on sale Dec. 2 in Europe and Dec. 10 in Japan, Microsoft has said. In 2001, when Microsoft introduced the first Xbox, it focused heavily on hard-core gamers, typically males age 17 to 24 , who wanted a high-end machine with more sophisticated graphics and more complex game functions. The PlayStation and the Nintendo GameCube, meanwhile, put more emphasis on reaching the mainstream market, analysts said. This time, Microsoft is planning a wider attack. Brochures going out to major retailers like Best Buy prominently describe the 360's ability to double as a DVD player, play music from an MP3 player through a television's speakers and even display digital photos on a TV. Its game functions, while impressive, are now only part of the message. The point, said Bill Nielsen, who oversees marketing for the Xbox 360, is to help a game player convince the women in the family that \"this is for you, too,\" The brochure even says, \"Here are some things you might want to tell your wife this thing does.\" Over Labor Day weekend, Microsoft and Pepsi began a radio promotion to give away 9,000 Xbox 360s by Nov. 22. Nielsen said those ads were meant not just to reach hard-core gamers, but their mothers. The Pepsi promotion \"also hits moms,\" Nielsen said, because \"moms make a lot of the final decisions\" on whether the family buys a new game console. Microsoft will also try to showcase more family-oriented games that can be played on the 360. The Xbox has long depended on the popularity of games like Halo, a shooting game, for console sales. But with the new machine, it will promote games like Kameo, an action-adventure game for younger teenagers, including girls. Industry analysts, however, are skeptical that the repositioning will work. They say it will be difficult to alter the Xbox's high-end image. And they point out that nongame features have not sold consoles in the past. The Xbox, like the PlayStation 2, can work as a DVD player, but most users do not use game consoles as substitutes for a stand-alone DVD player, analysts said. \"It's a tough sell\" to market the 360 to a mainstream audience, said Jeff Gerstmann, senior editor at GameSpot, an online gaming review site. \"It's icing on the cake - being able to view photos on an Xbox,\" Gerstmann said. \"But first and foremost this thing will always be viewed as a game machine.\" The biggest challenge in expanding the Xbox's reach, analysts say, is making available more games for mainstream players. Evan Wilson, a video game industry analyst with Pacific Crest Securities, said that even to redefine the Xbox as a multimedia console Microsoft would have to first produce more general-interest games. That will not happen in the next few months. Nielsen said most of the titles available for the holiday season would be sports and shooting games that appeal to the young male market. And the bulk of the initial advertising will be aimed at hard-core gamers willing to pay $299 for a base model or $399 for a model with add-ons like a wireless controller. Still, Nielsen said he was confident that family-friendly marketing could help redefine the Xbox's image as more games of broader appeal become available. The first week of November, Microsoft will begin a TV campaign with commercials on programs with a larger male audience, including many on the Fox network. The campaign will also include print ads in video game trade publications, Internet spots and heavy advertising at movie theaters. Last week, the company announced a partnership with Adidas to put Xbox game kiosks in Adidas stores. Nielsen declined to say how much the company planned to spend over all on its campaign. The early indications are that demand for the Xbox will be strong. Online preorders have been so high that some retailers now take preorders only for bundled packages, which include several games. The Web site of GameStop, for example, offers an Xbox bundle for $699, which includes five games and an extra controller. The stakes are high for Microsoft. Sony and Nintendo plan to introduce new consoles next year. In the game wars, the PlayStation 2 has sold 30 million units; the GameCube has sold around 10 million; and the Xbox has sold 13 million in North America, according to the NPD Group, a market research company. Wilson of Pacific Crest said he expected Microsoft to make two million to three million Xbox 360s available, but demand could well be greater. A shortage might even benefit Microsoft, he said, by attracting attention well into 2006. \"They want to keep interest high all the way through the launch of PlayStation 3,\" Wilson said. "

                "XBOX, the video game console that Microsoft introduced nearly 14 months ago, is technologically sophisticated and, by many accounts, the best way to play games against competitors over the Internet. But the advantages have not translated into the returns Microsoft had hoped for. It has sold nine million Xbox consoles, on the low end of its projections; it continues to lose money on each one it sells; and it remains desperately behind Sony, whose PlayStation 2 is selling at a record pace. Wall Street analysts have mixed opinions about whether Microsoft's early effort has been successful, but they agree that it has a way to go. Avid game players like Brian Green, 26, who spends hours each week on both consoles, have a simple explanation for why Microsoft has yet to make the inroads it sought. ''The Xbox is cool,'' he said, ''but the PlayStation is where the games are at.'' That is not good news for Microsoft, because people tend to buy electronics based on the amount of software they can use. Sony learned that lesson two decades ago, when its technically superior Betamax video recorders were swamped by VHS machines that had more tapes available. Makers of video games are starting to produce more games for Xbox, but the 2-to-1 gap with PlayStation will take some time to close. And while Microsoft, which has more than $40 billion in cash on hand, can afford to be patient, analysts and investors wonder how much time and money it is willing to invest before it starts to turn a profit. The issue is of no small significance. The market for consoles and video games is worth more than $9 billion a year. Even while losing on selling consoles, Microsoft could still make a lot of money from game makers. They pay the console makers about $10 for each copy of the games they manufacture -- and they made well in excess of 50 million games in the United States last year. Games typically sell at retail for $50. For now, though, there are only losses for Microsoft. It declines to say how much it loses on each console, but industry analysts estimate the figure at close to $100. Sony, by contrast, does not sell PlayStation 2's below cost. Part of Microsoft's problem is the ambitious design of Xbox: its chipsets and other electronic components are more expensive than those of the PlayStation. Microsoft has also been unable to realize certain economies of scale because sales have not been as robust as expected. Joseph Osha, a semiconductor analyst at Merrill Lynch who follows Nvidia, a company that makes the graphics processing chips for the Xbox, said Microsoft had had to ''pull back sharply'' on its orders. He estimated that Microsoft had 1 million to 1.5 million unsold Xbox chipsets, which are the brains used in Xbox consoles. Microsoft is too big to have its stock price move significantly on sales of Xbox. But the effect of all that idle Xbox inventory is evident on its profit-and-loss statement. In a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Microsoft said its home and entertainment segment, which includes the Xbox and television divisions, lost $348 million in its most recent quarter on sales of $1.28 billion. In the period a year earlier, the home and entertainment unit lost $180 million on sales of $833 million. On a micro level, investors ''don't like it because they lose money on every piece of hardware they sell,'' said Michael P. Wallace, a video game industry analyst at UBS Warburg. But, he added, ''on a macro level, they're in the No. 2 spot.'' In addition to overtaking Nintendo, which makes the GameCube console, as the second-place console maker, Microsoft has put itself in a position to compete with Sony for years to come, Mr. Wallace said. When Microsoft introduced the Xbox in January 2001, it promised to put $2 billion into the product -- $500 million in advertising alone. It may well need to spend it all. In 2002, according to UBS Warburg, Sony sold 18.3 million PlayStation 2 consoles, while Microsoft sold 5.2 million Xbox machines and Nintendo sold 4.7 million GameCubes. These figures reflect consoles sold to consumers, not consoles that the manufacturers ship to wholesalers or retailers. THE good news for Microsoft is that industry experts expect it to widen its lead over Nintendo this year. Electronic Arts, the world's largest game maker, is projecting that in North America in 2003, Sony will sell 9 million to 10 million PlayStation 2's, Microsoft will sell 2.5 million to 3 million Xbox consoles and Nintendo will sell 2 million to 2.5 million machines. Electronic Arts also projects that Microsoft will beat Nintendo in Europe, the second-biggest market after the United States. Still, Microsoft is particularly struggling in Japan, where it has been virtually shut out of the market, selling a mere 300,000 consoles, according to the company. Throughout all of Asia, Microsoft has sold only 500,000 Xbox consoles, according to UBS Warburg, compared with Sony's sales of 3.67 million PlayStation 2's. Microsoft officials say they are hampered in Asia because Sony and Nintendo, both Japanese companies, have entrenched positions and great control over distribution and sales channels there. But industry analysts say Microsoft should come up with more than excuses. ''If Xbox has any chance of closing the gap against PlayStation, Microsoft is going to need a better Japanese strategy,'' said Michael Gartenberg, an analyst at Jupiter Research. He said it needed to have better games and to burrow into the Japanese distribution channel. Microsoft said it was already making progress on games, introducing in Japan a game called DOA Xtreme Beach Volleyball. The 80,000 games sold out within two days. Robert J. Bach, a senior vice president for the home and entertainment division, acknowledged that the Xbox was continuing to lose money, but he said that such losses were natural with a new business. A better picture of the situation, he said, is how the company is performing relative to its business plan. ''We're doing very well on that basis,'' he said. Analysts said Microsoft must also persuade video game makers to produce versions of their products for the Xbox. According to figures provided by Microsoft but compiled by NPD Funworld, an industry research group, there are 458 games available for the PlayStation 2, versus 207 for the Xbox and 168 for the Nintendo GameCube. Microsoft faces a chicken-and-egg problem: makers of video games won't make versions of their games for a given console unless the machine has a wide installed base, but it is hard to build a base without a lot of games. Some big game makers have made versions only for the PlayStation 2. Most notable has been Grand Theft Auto, the most popular game the last two years. Microsoft said it is in discussions with the game's maker, Take Two Interactive, to persuade it to produce a version for the Xbox. Xbox also suffers because video game publishers will sometimes release a PlayStation 2 version of a game first, then deliver an Xbox version months later. That happened last year with Medal of Honor, a top-selling game from Electronic Arts that came out some six months earlier on the PlayStation 2. Jeff Brown, a spokesman for Electronic Arts, said, however, that the company was increasingly releasing games concurrently for the two platforms. Industry analysts like Mr. Wallace of UBS Warburg said Microsoft needed to find video game makers that would produce hit titles exclusively for its console. To bolster its game portfolio, Microsoft has been in discussions to buy Vivendi Universal Games. Microsoft would not comment on the issue. In the meantime, Microsoft has quietly begun to make inroads with a feature that cuts across individual games: Xbox Live. This is a $50 attachment that lets console owners play games against one another over the Internet. Microsoft, citing figures from NPD Funworld, said it sold 350,000 Xbox Live kits since introducing the service in November. Sony has sold 438,000 of its own online kit, said Microsoft, citing NPD Funworld figures, but Sony has been selling its kit for almost twice as long, since August. Mr. Bach said that these kinds of numbers showed that Microsoft, by sticking to its plan, could succeed, and he has said so to Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates, and its chief executive, Steven A. Ballmer. ''In the conversations I have with Bill and Steve, they want to know where we are on that plan,'' he said. ''We're on that plan.'' The question is whether Brian Green and other gamers are on board, too."

                "Rockstar Games, maker of the wildly popular and highly controversial Grand Theft Auto series of video games, right, announced yesterday that a new installment of the series is in development for Microsoft's Xbox 360 game console and Sony's PlayStation 3. The announcement came one day before the world's largest video-game convention, known as E3, opens in Los Angeles. As gamers and industry executives from around the globe have descended on Los Angeles, the potential development of a new Grand Theft Auto has been widely rumored, yet yesterday's confirmation is sure to become one of the main topics of discussion on the show floor. (But it appears unlikely that Rockstar will demonstrate any elements of the game at the convention.) The announcement was a blow to Sony because previous versions of Grand Theft Auto have had their debuts exclusively on PlayStation 2, which has helped sell the Sony machines. This time, Rockstar is making Grand Theft Auto for the Xbox 360 simultaneously with the Sony version. In addition, Peter Moore, corporate vice president for Microsoft's games business, announced at Microsoft's E3 news conference that Rockstar would be making add-ons for Grand Theft Auto IV available by download over Microsoft's Xbox Live service. The game is to arrive in October 2007. SETH SCHIESEL"

                "Escalating the hard-nosed price war in the video game industry, Microsoft is to announce today that it will cut the price of its Xbox console in North America by a third, to $199 from $299. It already costs Microsoft more than $299 to make each Xbox. Yesterday, Microsoft's rival console maker, Sony, cut the price of its PlayStation 2 by $100, to $199. Sony says it expects the PlayStation 2, which has been on the market a year longer than the Xbox and shipped about 10 times as many units, to soon be profitable at the new price. Microsoft had planned to announce a price cut next week at the Electronic Entertainment Expo, an annual industry trade show in Los Angeles, but acted instead after Sony's announcement. A third maker of video game consoles, Nintendo, said yesterday that it had no plans to lower the North American price of its $199 GameCube system. Chris Gaither (NYT)"

                "The Microsoft Corporation, following a pattern of delays and shortfalls by the makers of video game consoles, yesterday postponed by one week the North American release of its Xbox game system. The company, a newcomer to the console industry, said it still planned to ship a million to 1.5 million consoles by the end of the holiday season. But retailers said they expected to receive about half the 600,000 to 800,000 consoles promised for the first day, which is now Nov. 15 instead of Nov. 8. Despite the delay, which some analysts attributed in part to delays in shipping after last week's terror attacks, several major retailers said they expected fierce demand for Microsoft's first game console. Toys ''R'' Us, Barnes & Noble and KB Toys said they did not expect their holiday-season earnings to suffer as long as Microsoft got its consoles into stores before Thanksgiving. ''We will sell everything we can get our hands on,'' said Maureen O'Connell, chief financial officer for Barnes & Noble, whose online subsidiary Gamestop.com has sold out of advance orders for Xbox consoles and games. A Microsoft spokesman attributed the delay to ''dozens of reasons,'' and would not comment on the impact of air traffic disruptions. The Xbox is the most ambitious effort yet for Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, to build hardware. The company plans to support the Xbox with a $500 million marketing budget. The consoles will have a suggested retail price of $299.99, less than the manufacturing cost. But Microsoft expects to turn a profit from the multibillion-dollar business of publishing and licensing games software. Robbie Bach, chief Xbox officer for Microsoft, said the company had begun to manufacture final consoles at its plant in Guadalajara, Mexico, and would produce more than 100,000 consoles each week after the initial shipment in November. ''We remain very confident in our ability to ship and sell a million to 1.5 million units through the holiday season,'' Mr. Bach said in an interview. But Microsoft appears resigned to an initial shipment of fewer products. Mr. Bach would not reiterate his earlier promise that his company would initially ship at least 600,000 consoles, saying, ''We decided to move beyond that Day 1 number.'' Michael L. Glazer, chief executive of KB Toys, said Microsoft prepared KB for the likelihood of reduced quantities about a month ago. Reached by cellphone at the opening of a new store in Chicago, Mr. Glazer was asked to comment on recent analysts' reports that Microsoft had lowered its expected shipment to 300,000 to 400,000. ''That would be about what our anticipation is at this point,'' he said, adding that the reduced amounts could create even more demand for the Xbox. Shares of Microsoft fell $1.05, or 2 percent, to $49.71, and shares of two companies that make Xbox chips, Intel and Nvidia, lost 7 percent. Intel lost $1.37, to $19.30, and Nvidia fell $1.91, to $26.97. Microsoft is learning harsh lessons about the difficulty of producing a video game console -- lessons already learned by its competitors. Last month, Nintendo delayed the North American release of its GameCube console by nearly two weeks, until Nov. 18, but said it would ship 700,000 consoles, 25 percent more than anticipated. When Sony introduced its PlayStation 2 last year, it initially shipped 400,000 consoles, instead of the expected one million, because of component shortages. Analysts said the aftermath of the terrorist attacks played a role in Microsoft's decision. The company is on strict production schedules as it tries to create and mass-produce a game system from scratch in only 18 months. The grounding of airline flights after the attacks delayed the arrival of important electronics components, analysts said. ''They lost four days they didn't have, and now they gained themselves seven days,'' said Richard Doherty, director of research for the Envisioneering Group, a technology assessment and market research firm based in Seaford, N.Y. Mr. Doherty said Sony could benefit this year from a scarcity of Xbox consoles. ''The one that's in stock is the one that's going home and under the tree,'' he said. But Microsoft has said the true test of its potency against Sony will be the 2002 holiday season, when it anticipates a broader portfolio of games. Sony recovered from its delays last year and became the dominant force in the market, with an expected six million consoles sold by the end of 2001. As Sony improved its production, customers continued to buy consoles, said Jeanne Meyer, a spokeswoman for the online subsidiary of Toys ''R'' Us. ''There were probably a lot of I.O.U.'s in stockings, but people were very patient,'' she said. -------------------- 6 States Criticize Microsoft By Reuters WASHINGTON, Sept 21 -- The attorneys general of six states today added their support to the government's antitrust case against Microsoft and expressed concerns about how the company's new Windows XP operating system would affect competition in the software industry. In a letter sent to the company's chief executive, Steven A. Ballmer, Attorney General William H. Sorrell of Vermont and five other attorneys general said they wanted to ''add our voices to those calling on Microsoft to remedy the antitrust problems that are now evident.''

                "A new line of televisions from RCA may help game players reduce the snarl of dusty wires behind the set. These 11 new models have a special connection, the RCA VPort, that allows Microsoft Xbox owners to plug in with a single cable rather than three. Jeff DeClue, a product planning manager for RCA, said that the specialized port improves game image quality, particularly by reducing ''dot crawling,'' the shimmer that often surrounds stationary text when it appears on a television screen. The VPort may even benefit users of competing game systems or consumers whose tastes do not run to video games. With a special adapter that will be offered with some of the models, it can double as an extra video input that can be used, among other things, for DVD players. The screen size of the 11 television sets ranges from 20 to 36 inches, and the sets are priced at $349 to $1,499. Some models are available now, and the entire series is expected to reach stores by September. Ian Austen"

                " NEW YORK — Microsoft said on Thursday that its second-quarter profit rose 5.5 percent, buoyed by new server software, but that revenue missed forecasts after sales of the video-game console Xbox 360fell short. Net income advanced to $3.65 billion, or 34 cents a share, from $3.46 billion, or 32 cents, a year earlier, the company said. Sales gained 9.4 percent, to $11.8 billion, missing its October forecast of $11.9 billion to $12 billion. The company shipped 1.5 million Xbox machines in the quarter.The Xbox sold out days after it went on sale on Nov. 22 in the United States after a failure to secure Xbox components limited supply. The company had pinned its hopes on holiday sales of the machines to bolster revenue and win market share from PlayStation, which is made by Sony. \"Xbox does have a material impact for Microsoft in the December quarter because of the holiday shopping season,\" said David Hilal, an analyst at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey. \"The fact it was capacity constrained in December will probably create some headwinds for their overall quarter.\" Sales also missed the $12 billion average estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial. Shares of Microsoft, which reported after the close of trading,rose 10 cents to $26.50. Revenue this quarter will be $10.9 billion to $11.2 billion, Microsoft said. Per-share earnings will be 32 cents to 33 cents. The new Windows and Office, coming this year, will anchor plans by Steve Ballmer, the company's chief executive, to buttress sales growth and win back investors who say Microsoft Google in the hottest markets such as Internet search. Profit was bolstered by rising personal-computer demand. Global PC shipments rose 17 percent in the quarter, according to the researcher IDC. That beat company forecasts of a 10 percent to 12 percent rise. Microsoft's sales may pick up in coming quarters with the release of Windows Vista, which will have new features like a built-in search engine for scouring the Web and files on PCs, and an application to organize and display photos. Nokia profit falls Nokia, the world's largest maker of mobile phones, on Thursday reported an unexpected drop in fourth-quarter profit and said cellphone prices might fall. The company also said it planned to buy back E6.5 billion worth of stock this year, Bloomberg News reported from Helsinki. Net income fell to E1.07 billion, or $1.3 billion, from E1.08 billion a year earlier. Earnings per share rose to 25 cents from 24 cents as the company bought back stock. Sales increased to E10.3 billion from E9.46 billion, Nokia's chief executive, Jorma Ollila, said at a press meeting in Espoo, Finland, where Nokia is based. Ollila, who plans to step down on June 1, announced the company's biggest-ever share buyback, underpinning a stock that fell as much as 5.1 percent after the results. Nokia said handset prices, which dropped 11 percent last year, might fall this quarter as sales increase in emerging markets. Ollila will be succeeded this year by the company's president, Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo. Jarmo Nieminen, a fund manager at Nordea in Helsinki, said that \"margins and average selling prices lagged expectations\" as the volume growth is in China and India. The forecast for phone prices \"was a disappointment, as expectations were for an increase,\" he said. Nokia is trying to lift sales and margins by selling more advanced phones in Europe and the United States and luring buyers in growth markets like India and China. Shares of Nokia fell 23 cents, or 1.5 percent, to E14.89 in Helsinki. Nokia was expected to earn E1.09 billion on sales of E10.07 billion, the median forecast of 17 analysts in a Bloomberg News survey showed. The company plans to pay a dividend of 37 cents a share for 2005, up from 33 cents a year earlier, it said in a Helsinki exchange statement. Average selling prices fell to E99 in the fourth quarter, from E102 in the preceding three months and E111 a year earlier, Nokia said. Prices will be \"flat to slightly down sequentially\" in the first quarter, Nokia said. Richard Windsor, an analyst at Nomura International in London, said that Nokia's forecast that prices may drop this quarter \"is negative, given that they have a strong product line-up.\" "

                "SAN FRANCISCO — Imagine your blender breaking down twice. The vacuum cleaner giving up the ghost three times. The espresso maker repeatedly going kaput. Then imagine replacing the item with the same model over and over while keeping your brand loyalty and sanity. Stephano Nevarez can. Since he first bought his $400 Microsoft Xbox 360 in 2006, it has failed three times. Each time, he sent the game machine back to the company and waited weeks for a repair or a replacement. \"There's nothing in the house that breaks down as much,\" said Stephano, a 15-year-old high school student from Salem, Oregon. Yet he remains a devotee of his 360 console, the more so because he wants to play Halo 3, the latest iteration of a violent space epic due in stores on Sept. 25; it is available only for that game machine. The game, published by Microsoft, could redeem the company going into the holiday selling season. Untold numbers of 360 owners have watched their machines break down, and then, in many cases, watched the replacement consoles do the exact same thing because of a severe and widespread manufacturing flaw. But if the Xbox players keep coming back because of Halo 3, and if other gamers buy the console just for the game, then Microsoft could markedly improve its standing in its battle against rivals Sony and Nintendo. \"Halo 3 is Microsoft's most important game,\" said Dan Hsu, editor in chief of Electronic Gaming Monthly, a magazine for enthusiasts. Hsu, who has seen the game, said it delivers in spades, with one caveat: \"Assuming your machine does work, it does what it sets out to do.\" The bar is high. Combined, Halo and Halo 2 have sold around 15 million units, making the series one of the most successful game franchises of all time. The game has spawned novels, comic books and a possible movie. The $12.5 billion console and video game business is up for grabs this year. On the console side, Nintendo is off to an unexpectedly strong start with its Wii, a game system that makes its players get up off the couch and move their bodies to direct action. It has well over 28 percent of the American console market, according to NPD Group, a market analysis firm. The Wii is currently selling at a faster pace than the 360, and the company is releasing its big games this fall, Super Mario Galaxy and Super Smash Bros. Brawl, though neither is as popular as Halo. Sony, with about 14 percent of the market, was hurt when the release date of Grand Theft Auto IV, a game it was counting on to increase console sales, was pushed back from October into the second quarter of next year. Microsoft, which has 57 percent of the market, has declined to say what is causing some of its Xbox 360 to stop working, or how many machines have been affected. It has set aside $1.1 billion for repairs, a figure that suggests to industry analysts that the problem could affect a third of the 11.6 million 360s already in the hands of consumers. Microsoft has said that it will fix any faulty Xbox 360 free of charge. The most likely explanation of where the engineers went wrong is that the 360s are poorly designed to deal with the intense heat generated by game play and that computer chips and other electronics may be popping off the motherboard, said Richard Doherty, an analyst with the Envisioneering Group, a technology assessment and market research firm. Doherty said he thinks that Microsoft, in an effort to put is machine into the market a year ahead of the Sony PlayStation 3, had skimped on product testing. He said that the failure rate among 360s is almost unheard-of among consumer electronics, where having even 1 percent or 2 percent of machines fail is considered a major problem. He has been doing surveys of video game consumers, and results suggest that their patience is waning and that news of the problems is dissuading some potential buyers, he said. Even die-hard users, he said, are wondering why they cannot take their machine to a store to have it checked out, rather than wait for it to break. \"It's dissipating a tremendous amount of momentum they built up prior to July,\" Doherty said, referring to when Microsoft first publicly discussed its $1.1 billion repair fund. \"This is going to get worse before it gets better.\" But some financial analysts said that the eventual damage to reputation and revenue may not be so profound. Evan Wilson, an equity analyst with Pacific Crest Securities, said he thought that Microsoft's fix-it-free policy had mollified many avid game players who have been among the first to purchase the 360. Aaron Greenberg, group product manager for Xbox 360, said the repair campaign is aggressive and that the company, while it is not discussing what has gone wrong, is not taking the failures lightly. \"It's our equivalent of the Blue Screen of Death people talk about with Windows,\" he said, referring to the derogatory vernacular used to describe what happens when a PC running Microsoft's operating system mysteriously stops working. In the case of the Xbox 360, affected users have taken to calling the problem the Three Red Rings of Death. That's because when the 360 dies, three lights on the front of the console blink red. \"It started getting really loud,\" said Michael White, 27, of Montreal, a high school teacher, who said his system died in April. \"You expect somebody's expensive product to be more durable than that.\" Is he infuriated? Not really. \"I'm a happy customer,\" he said, given it only took three weeks to repair and he likes the games on the system. Others are feeling slightly less generous — or, at least, their spouses are. \"My wife told me she didn't want me to buy anymore Microsoft consoles,\" said Joshua Bridges, an accountant in Spring, Texas \"But I told her I'm a huge fan of the games that come out for this platform.\" Chief among his interests is Halo 3. He said he likes the fast-twitch action, but particularly the story, which involves soldiers battling against an alien race called the Covenant for control of a destructive force called the Halo. Halo 3 is the last in a trilogy. When it comes out on Sept. 25, the avid fans will be waiting in line at video game retailers across the country. More than one million units have already been ordered. For the last three years, a team of 250 full-time and part-time designers and engineers at Bungie Studios, the development house that is owned by Microsoft, have been assembling Halo 3, said Frank O'Connor, the game's head writer. (He declined to say how much money they spent on the game). Developers felt enormous pressure, he said, and he hopes this version will be the most popular ever, particularly given new features, like the ability of players to record and make short movies of the action they just played. \"Instead of being able to say: remember the time I did that one thing? Now they'll be able to save it and show it,\" O'Connor said. One question is whether it can help Microsoft sell more consoles to mainstream consumers, or to those who may be concerned about the reliability of the 360 systems. But there is little doubt the faithful will be there in force, and thrilled about it, having forgiven Microsoft for the flaws in its console. \"I'm on my third 360,\" said Benjamin Lin, an 18-year-old Halo enthusiast from Seattle, \"and it's working great for me.\""

                "TOKYO — Microsoft said Monday that it would reduce the price of its Xbox 360 game consoles in Japan by up to 29 percent, below Nintendo's Wii and Sony's PlayStation 3, in a bid to revive its sluggish sales. Demand for the Xbox 360 has been tepid in Japan, mainly because of a lack of popular games. In contrast, the market-leading Wii is thriving on a range of innovative software, prompting Nintendo to raise its earnings forecast Friday. \"It has not gone entirely smoothly,\" Takashi Sensui, general manager of Microsoft's home and entertainment division in Japan, said of the Xbox's performance since its arrival three years ago. \"There are some analysts who say they are waiting for the next generation of the Xbox,\" he said, adding that Microsoft took a different view. \"We will keep trying to be at the center of the storm in the Japanese market,\" Sensui said at a Tokyo event to outline the company's year-end business strategy. But analysts said that to compete successfully, lower prices were not enough and Microsoft would need to develop blockbuster games to rival the Wii. Microsoft will cut the price of the Xbox 360 Arcade, which comes without a hard drive and is the least costly of the three Xbox 360 models, by ¥8,000, or $73.92, to ¥19,800, starting Sept. 11. That would make the Arcade less expensive than the Wii, which sells for about ¥25,000, and the PlayStation 3, which sells for ¥39,800. Microsoft will also cut the price of the high-end Elite model by ¥8,000 to ¥39,800. It will upgrade the standard model's hard-disk drive to 60 gigabytes from 20 gigabytes and sell it for ¥29,800. Before the upgrade, that model sold for ¥34,800. Microsoft has already cut the price of the Xbox 360 in the United States, Europe and four other Asian markets as it tries to bite off a larger chunk of the $57 billion game industry. In Europe, the Xbox 360 Arcade costs less than the Wii. A KBC Securities analyst, Hiroshi Kamide, said price cuts alone were unlikely to result in a jump in demand for the Xbox 360 and that Microsoft needed to focus more on producing attractive software. \"Popular software is now serving as a tail wind to Xbox sales,\" he said. \"Even if they slash the console price, that would not directly boost sales unless they release more good software.\" Robust demand for the Namco Bandai Holdings role-playing game called \"Tales of Vesperia\" helped Xbox 360 sales in Japan beat PlayStation 3 for the first time in the week that ended Aug. 10. The Wii's success has been attributed to inventive titles such as the \"Wii Fit\" exercise game, its low price and its easy-to-learn motion-sensing controller. The Wii has sold 6.67 million units so far in Japan, nearly triple the 2.32 million sales of the PlayStation 3, according to the game magazine publisher Enterbrain. The Xbox has sold only 684,695 units, even though it was unveiled about a year earlier, in December 2005. Microsoft also announced Monday that in early 2009, it would roll out an Xbox action game called \"Ninja Blade\" that was developed by FromSoftware. Sensui said that a 60-gigabyte Xbox 360 would be introduced in Japan at ¥29,800 yen. Analysts say that offering popular game software is critical to making any machine a hit. Microsoft has been wooing talented Japanese game designers to make exclusive games for Xbox 360 for years. But the effort is risky because fancy games require money and time. And so star designers are apt to prefer widespread consoles. Microsoft said that new games, including Capcom's \"Street Fighter IV\" and \"The Last Remnant\" from Square Enix, are in the works, and the company showed short computer graphics videos from several games that are in development. Keiji Inafune of Capcom said games that compete globally tended to have dark humor and shooting scenes, which he acknowledged were not popular among Japanese. \"We are determined to survive against global competition,\" he said. The Wii console has been popular, selling 29.6 million worldwide so far. PlayStation 3 sales have lagged at fewer than half of Wii sales at 14.4 million. \"Xbox 360 will become more fun and easier to use,\" Sensui said. \"It will also become more affordable.\""

                "LOS ANGELES — In what may be one of the costliest consumer warranty repairs in history, Microsoft announced that it would spend up to $1.15 billion to fix failing Xbox 360 game machine consoles. While the company would not say how many units were failing, Robbie Bach, president of Microsoft's entertainment and devices division, said Thursday that there have been an \"unacceptable high number of repairs.\" The \"majority\" of Xbox 360 owners, he said, have not experienced hardware failure. Company officials said that Microsoft had sold a total of 11.6 million Xbox 360 units as of the end of the last quarter, slightly shy of the 12 million units the company had predicted. The XBox 360, which first went on sale in November 2005, is currently the best-selling game machine in the United States, according to NPD, a market research firm. The size of the anticipated repair bill suggests that a third to as many as half of the machines are flawed. The company said it would take a charge of between $1.05 billion and $1.15 billion against earnings in the quarter ended June 30th. Consumers know they have a problem if three red flashing lights appear on the console. Gamers on online forums have taken to referring to the event as \"the Red Ring of Death\" because the machine then shuts down. The company refused to explain the cause of the failure, but said it was not caused by a single issue in the machine that it said contained 1,700 different components and 500 million transistors. The company said there were no health or safety issues involved. The problem began to appear over the past three to four months, according to Bach, after \"significant usage\" of the consoles. Bach said the company had taken steps to correct the problem in new devices. Microsoft said it would extend the warranty of the game console to three years to customers worldwide. Previously, products sold in the United States were covered by a one-year warranty, while Xbox 360 units sold in Europe received a two-year warranty. In addition, any customers who have had their consoles repaired due to the \"three flashing lights\" problem will be reimbursed for the cost of repairs. Microsoft has succeeded in establishing the Xbox brand against the better known Sony PlayStation and other game machines. The Xbox and its successor the XBox 360 was the software maker's first major foray into hardware. Though sales are small relative to the rest of Microsoft's revenue, the XBox has been an important venture for the company and was viewed by many analysts as Microsoft's attempt to compete with the likes of Sony and Apple for control of electronics and entertainment within homes. The device can be used to access the Internet and to view movies. Microsoft said that its entertainment and devices division reported an operating loss of $315 million on $929 million in revenue for the three-month period that ended in March, and analysts have estimated that the company has lost about $6 billion in its effort to get a foothold in the game machine industry. A new XBox 360 with a 20-gigabyte hard drive sells for about $400, but other versions are about $300. The announcement comes on the eve of the E3 Media and Business Summit, the video game industry's major trade show, which will be held next week in Los Angeles. \"This is bound to affect discussions between Microsoft and its developers and retailers,\" said Richard Doherty, a partner in the Envisioneering Group research firm."

                "Among other new features, the new Toyota Yaris has a giant tentacle that reaches out of its roof to shoot enemies as it races through a futuristic tunnel, sometimes within inches of soaring fireballs. The tentacle is not standard on the new models. This Yaris car was devised by a video game company rather than automobile engineers. The shooting car is the central character of a new Xbox game called Yaris that Toyota was introducing Monday. The game will be offered free to all Xbox 360 console owners in the United States and Canada, who can download it from Xbox Live's service. It is also the first Xbox game created by an advertiser to be distributed over Xbox Live. Like scores of other consumer brand companies, Toyota is increasingly creating its own content, like video games, rather than relying simply on advertising during commercial breaks. \"People can time-shift; they can do all sorts of different things to avoid advertising,\" said Kim McCullough, corporate manager for marketing communications at Toyota. \"That's why we have to move beyond traditional advertising to do things that are really engaging for people.\" Toyota introduced the Yaris, a moderately priced subcompact, in 2006, and has focused its advertising on young consumers. Yaris is not the first brand to advertise through custom-made video games. Two years ago, Volvo introduced an Xbox game that emphasizes safe driving. It was given away at dealerships. Doritos ran a contest (www.unlockxbox.com) this past summer for Xbox game ideas, and the top five ideas are being produced by professionals. Advertisers are also increasingly buying product placement space within games rather than creating their own. Advertisers in the United States will spend $502 million on video game advertising this year, up from $346 million last year, according to eMarketer, a research firm. Just over half of that is in the form of ads placed within games, and the rest is for marketers to create their own games, known in the industry as advergames. Advertisers generally view video game fans as people who are hard to reach and do not like commercial messages, said Shahid Khan, a partner at IBB Consulting Group, a media consulting firm. \"This group does not want to be advertised to,\" Khan said. \"It has to be a really good game. If it is a really good video game, then it won't matter if it was made by an advertiser.\" Of course, advertisers might have trouble competing with the popularity of Xbox games like Halo 3, which was released last month. Within a week, Microsoft announced that the game had more than $300 million in sales, a high level for any game. Burger King's Sneak King Xbox game, introduced last autumn, has become perhaps the most well-known advergame. Customers can buy the game for $3.99 at Burger King restaurants (with the purchase of a BK value meal). About 3.5 million games have been sold, according to Burger King. Using Xbox data on game use, the Burger King game equates in time spent to more than 1.4 billion 30-second commercials, the fast-food company says. \"Interacting with our characters in the games is actually more engaging than just sitting back in your chair and watching a Super Bowl commercial,\" said Russ Klein, president for global marketing for Burger King. Klein cautioned that giving a game away, as Toyota is doing, might cause people to be suspicious of the game's quality. Games in the Xbox Live Arcade section, where the Yaris game will be available, normally cost $5 to $15 a download. The idea and game design for the Yaris game came from Toyota's advertising agency, Saatchi & Saatchi in Los Angeles, which outsourced production to Backbone Entertainment, a division of Foundation 9 Entertainment. Backbone is perhaps best known for creating the Sonic the Hedgehog games. Toyota is spending in the low millions of dollars for the campaign, which includes paying Microsoft to promote it and developing the game at a cost higher than typical casual games. \"The level of finish on this is really polished. It had to be,\" said Harvey Marco, executive creative director at Saatchi & Saatchi, which is part of the Publicis Groupe. \"It's not overt branding. It's called the Yaris game, it's about driving the Yaris around, but we're not coming out and throwing taglines into the game.\" Past campaigns for the Yaris have also centered on emerging technologies. Yaris sponsored short cellphone episodes of Fox's \"Prison Break\" last year and ran ads in the game Anarchy Online. Players earned \"power-up\" points in the game by watching Yaris ads on billboards."

                "With the release of new wireless controllers, gamers using any of the current generation of consoles -- the GameCube, PlayStation 2 and, now, the Xbox -- can play without a tangle of cords stretched across the floor. Relying on the same radio frequency technology used for cordless phones, Mad Catz's Lynx Wireless Controller and Logitech's Cordless Controller allow you to play untethered from your Xbox. The straightforward Mad Catz controller for the Xbox ($59.99), above, resembles the one that comes with the Xbox, while Logitech's controller ($69.95) has a streamlined design reminiscent of a stealth bomber. The new Xbox controllers, which are not yet widely available online or in stores, have won praise from reviewers but have a drawback for online gamers. The Xbox Live online gaming service allows players to communicate with one another using a headset that plugs into a memory card slot on the game controller. Both of the wireless controllers, however, place the slots on the base unit rather than on the controller. So until someone creates a cordless headset for the Xbox, online gamers may want to stick with wired controllers. The controllers offer a pleasant contrast with the models made by the two companies for PlayStation 2. Mad Catz's Lynx Wireless Controller for PlayStation 2 drops its connection, while Logitech's wireless PlayStation 2 controller is awkward to hold. Perhaps Mad Catz and Logitech will be inspired by their Xbox models to do as well for the PlayStation 2. Charles Herold"

                "The Microsoft Corporation plans to announce today at the Tokyo Game Show that it will begin selling the Xbox 360, its new video game console, on Nov. 22. The release of the console will be the start of the transition to the next generation of game consoles from the top competitors in that market -- Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo. Video game industry analysts said it was too soon to tell how much benefit Microsoft would gain by being the first out of the gate. Sony plans to release PlayStation 3 next spring, and Nintendo has not given a release date for its next console. Still, several analysts said that Microsoft should enjoy strong demand, particularly among hard-core game players, which could give Xbox 360 a lead in the marketing wars against Sony's PlayStation 2, the best-selling game console to date. When Sony introduced the PlayStation 2 in North America in November 2000, it sold 1.1 million consoles over the holiday season, said Evan Wilson, an industry analyst with Pacific Crest Securities. Mr. Wilson said it was possible for Microsoft to sell 1.5 million consoles in North America during the coming holiday season. \"The demand,\" he said, \"is higher at this point than people were expecting.\" He said that specialty video game retailers, like Electronics Boutique, told analysts that they had already sold out their allotment to consumers through advance orders. But the optimistic projections are based on guesses of how many consoles Microsoft will have available worldwide during the holiday season. Xbox will be available in Europe on Dec. 2 and in Japan on Dec. 10. The company said previously it planned to sell a base model for $299 and a premium version for $399, which is to include a wireless controller and high-definition television connectors intended to appeal to enthusiasts. Michael Pachter, a video game industry analyst at Wedbush Morgan Securities, however, said he would not be surprised if Microsoft had only two million consoles ready to ship to retailers worldwide, reducing sales projections. \"They'll be supply-constrained,\" Mr. Pachter said, noting that Microsoft did not announce the names of its manufacturing partners until August. In an interview yesterday, Mitch Koch, head of retail sales for Microsoft, declined to say how many consoles Microsoft planned to have available. He did say that production of final Xbox 360 consoles has begun, but would not say precisely when it had started. Mr. Koch said he expected that during the holiday season, 25 to 40 new video games would be available for the Xbox 360, a figure that analysts said was optimistic. That number is considered a significant measure of potential console sales because the more games available, the more reasons for consumers to buy a new machine. When Microsoft broke into the game console business in October 2001, with the first Xbox, there were only five games available, and two of them were made by Microsoft, said Anita Frazier, an analyst with NPD Funworld, a market research firm. When the PlayStation 2 arrived, she said, it was accompanied by 28 games. The growth of interest in Xbox 360 evident among the makers of video games shows that Microsoft \"has proven itself as a player in the industry,\" Ms. Frazier said. Ms. Frazier said that in the United States, consumers have purchased 30 million PlayStation 2 units, 13 million Xbox units and 10 million Nintendo GameCube units. The crucial question for Microsoft is whether it can break into Sony's market share. Paul-Jon McNealy, a video game industry analyst with American Technology Research, said that Microsoft's release of the console before its competitors does not ensure that it will win market share. Still, he said, \"the prospects are better than if they were launching a year from now.\""

                "It was a day off for Broadway’s two Farinellis. The man who plays the role and the man who sings the role were instead focused on a big-screen television. They were feverishly toggling Xbox One controllers — novices trying to figure out how to make animated soccer players properly execute a cross. Sam Crane and Iestyn Davies both portray the famed 18th-century Italian opera singer in “Farinelli and the King,” a play by Claire van Kampen now at the Belasco Theater. The real Farinelli was a castrato, his high voice resulting from childhood castration, a once common procedure starting in the 1500s. The play tells the true story of his efforts to provide a kind of music therapy to a mentally anguished King Philippe V of Spain (Mark Rylance, who is also Ms. Van Kampen’s husband). Mr. Crane speaks the lines, but when it’s time for the character to sing, Mr. Davies, an acclaimed countertenor, steps onstage to deliver Handel arias while his identically costumed other half stands by. Both are British, 38, and never met before the production, which had its premiere in 2015 at Shakespeare’s Globe in London. The two men share similar boyish features. If one didn’t know better, they could be mistaken for siblings. Mr. Davies’s jaw is slightly wider and Mr. Crane wears glasses, but onstage, in brocaded waistcoats, powdered wigs and shiny shoes, they are almost indistinguishable. And even now, as they relaxed together offstage, they were reminded of the oddness of the performing task they’ve been assigned. “I don’t relate to Sam onstage — I enter scenes when he’s doing something else or he stays onstage when I’m singing,” Mr. Davies explained. “I have to sometimes remind myself that we are the same person so I don’t accidentally interact with him.” “My side of Farinelli is more aware of you than you are of me,” Mr. Crane said, turning to Mr. Davies. Mr. Davies nodded. “You’ve inhabited the character, the person, more than I have to,” he said. They were sharing a couch in a cavernous space called The Pub, some 30 feet below the Belasco stage. This is where the cast spends most of its limited free time (often still in costume) during the shows. The Pub has foosball and Ping-Pong tables, several couches, a makeshift bar and light-bulbs dangling off wires hanging off the ceiling. Onstage they mimic each other’s motions and personality. On this basement sofa, they were a study in contrasts. Mr. Crane brought his family: his wife Pinny, 9-year-old son Kit and 6-year-old daughter Iris. Mr. Davies came alone. Mr. Crane’s favorite Premier League team is Arsenal, while Mr. Davies roots for rival Liverpool. Mr. Davies was expressive, often raising his voice at the video game, whether it was a near-missed goal, a poor offsides call or an uncooperative controller. Mr. Crane was mostly serene, nearly frozen in place in game after game, while his exuberant son flanked him with encouragement and instructions. (Iris, uninterested in soccer, sat nearby playing a wooden board game version of tic-tac-toe with her mother.) “What is pass? B, right?” Mr. Crane calmly asked Kit. “What the hell is that? Is that a shot?” Mr. Davies grumbled at himself, after a particular play went awry. “What am I doing?” Mr. Crane said a few seconds later. The first game was not going well for him. “You should’ve passed!” his son interjected. “I know what I should’ve done but I don’t know how to do that,” Mr. Crane answered. “I keep getting confused.” Though they share a role, the Farinellis described their relationship as no closer than with the rest of the cast — but also emphasized that the whole ensemble was tight. (To that point, half an hour before the house opens at every show, the cast bats around a volleyball in the aisles.) Mr. Davies is more loose and jocular before a performance, Mr. Crane said. Mr. Davies attributed that to being freed from the burden of acting, normally part of his responsibility when singing in full operas. (His last New York appearance was in “The Exterminating Angel” at the Metropolitan Opera.) Yet the video game was proving a struggle for both of them. Neither player scored in the first match, much to the chagrin of Kit, the frustration of Mr. Davies and the bemusement of Mr. Crane. They tried again in a second match. This match was going the same way. But finally a breakthrough: Mr. Crane willed the Belgian striker Romelu Lukaku to knock the ball into the net. He jumped out of his chair with his arms raised. The serene Farinelli had disappeared. “Yes! Yes! Come on! Come on!” he yelled. Even Iris raised her head to notice. Within minutes, though, Mr. Davies had tied the game. Eventually, the match turned to a shootout to settle things. Mr. Davies took control, scoring a few easy goals. “Rubbish!” Pinny said. “How did you not save that?” Kit asked his father, with high-pitched incredulity. “I don’t know how to save it,” Mr. Crane said with a quiet laugh, soon handing over the controller to his son. Farinelli vs. Farinelli had wrapped for the day. Mr. Crane let out a content sigh as everyone packed up to leave. Mr. Davies hummed a few notes. They would next see each other, in costume, the following night."

                "The Microsoft Corporation has delayed the Japanese introduction of its Xbox video game console until next year but says it remains on schedule to begin selling the consoles on its home turf on Nov. 8. Microsoft plans to announce in Tokyo today that the Xbox will go on sale in Japan on Feb. 22. The company does not intend to say how many consoles it will ship in Japan. ''We wanted to make sure we could focus all of our attention and all of our resources on the U.S.,'' said James Bernard, a spokesman for Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash. Microsoft, which is trying to build a home video game console business from scratch within two years, had said it would introduce the Xbox in North America and Japan this year, with a release in Europe next year. But several analysts said that an effort to manufacture and promote a brand-new console in Japan and North America simultaneously could have weakened both campaigns. ''In the short term, it's definitely a black eye for them,'' P. J. McNealy, an analyst with GartnerG2, a market research firm, said of the delay. ''But in the long term, if they launch in Japan with a more robust lineup, it serves them better on the five-year horizon.'' Microsoft will also announce that Namco, an influential game development company based in Japan, has agreed to create four games for the Xbox, including two titles that are exclusive to Microsoft's console. Schelley Olhava, an analyst with the International Data Corporation, a market research firm, said Microsoft was trying to counter criticism that it had failed to gain enough support from Japanese software developers, who create many of the best-selling games. ''They know that content is going to be what drives sales,'' Ms. Olhava said, referring to Microsoft. Product delays have long troubled the game console industry. Nintendo said last week that it would push back by 10 days, until Nov. 18, the North American introduction of its newest console, the GameCube. Nintendo executives suggested that they wanted to avoid the troubles of Sony, which frustrated retailers and consumers last year when production woes caused it to ship fewer PlayStation 2 consoles than anticipated. Mr. Bernard said Microsoft remained ''right on track'' for its announced introduction of 600,000 to 800,000 consoles on Nov. 8. The company is preparing to unleash an extensive campaign of advertisements, festival sponsorships and retail promotions, all supported by a $500 million marketing budget. But as a newcomer to the game industry, Microsoft lacks the established base of devoted game players that Nintendo and Sony enjoy. Retailers and customers could lose patience with the Xbox if the North American introduction falls short of the lofty expectations raised by Microsoft. Billy Pidgeon, an analyst with Jupiter Media Metrix, said: ''They've done their homework. But they haven't ever done this before, so they really don't have as much breathing room as someone like Nintendo.''"

                "Two software programmers who left Microsoft after spearheading the introduction of its Xbox video game console have reunited in a start-up games company. Seamus Blackley and Kevin Bachus plan to introduce today their new venture, the Capital Entertainment Group, which will function much like a Hollywood film producer for early-stage game projects. The company, based in Seattle, is raising more than $40 million from investors like the Durlacher Corporation to finance creative games ''that wouldn't otherwise get made,'' said Mr. Blackley, the company's vice president for development. Capital Entertainment will advise game developers, then seek marketing and distribution contracts with publishers. It will focus on games for the Xbox, he said, but will take on projects for any console or the personal computer. The company plans to announce its first development partnership today, with the publisher Sega of America. Chris Gaither (NYT)"

                " AMSTERDAM — In the five months since Microsoft introduced a prototype of its new video game machine, the Xbox 360, it has tried to generate excitement by staging demonstrations of the console's ability to play music and display digital photographs and by trumpeting its online community features. Yet as Microsoft has tried to build buzz for the 360, the most important ingredient has largely been missing: games. There have been snazzy screenshots and impressive trailers of new titles. But since the game industry's big trade show in Los Angeles in May, Microsoft has shown almost nothing in terms of actual, playable games. So far, Microsoft has done little to convince hard-core gamers that the 360 will be a must-buy this holiday season. Microsoft means to change that in a big way, starting now. On Tuesday and Wednesday, more than 1,000 journalists, analysts and game industry executives are gathering here at X05, Microsoft's game exhibition, to see and play the games that the company hopes will propel the 360 into millions of homes in its first few months. The machine will reach stores on Nov. 22 and cost $300 for a bare-bones model and $400 with accessories. \"They have shown a lot of other stuff like the community functions,\" said Dan Hsu, editor in chief of Electronic Gaming Monthly, \"but this is the one chance for Microsoft to really wow everybody and get people excited about the games and convince the industry that Xbox 360 will truly deliver a next-generation experience.\" Microsoft will try to create demand for its new machine by showing that its own game development operation is a budding hit factory. Games that Microsoft's own game division will publish for the 360, like \"Gears of War,\" \"Kameo\" and \"Perfect Dark Zero,\" will be scrutinized especially closely by the industry. Microsoft was also expected to announce this week several new internally published projects, including a game, \"Crackdown,\" under development by Real Time Worlds. The Crackdown announcement is likely to generate interest because one of the main developers at Real Time Worlds, Dave Jones, helped start the team that invented the wildly successful 'Grand Theft Auto\" franchise as well as the popular \"Lemmings\" game series. \"Microsoft responds fairly well to challenges, but they need to convince people that this system can deliver game play that simply isn't possible on the current generation,\" said Sid Shuman, a producer for Games.net, a game community Web site. \"That goes beyond graphics to elements like realistic physics, so if I want to roll a grenade under a car, for example, I can do that.\" Even as Microsoft champions its own games, the company is also eager to show that independent game publishers are enthusiastic about writing games for the 360 system. For example, Ubisoft Entertainment, the big French game company, plans to announce that its best-selling tactical combat game franchise, \"Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell,\" will be available for the 360 next year. Most analysts seem to agree that developers have had a positive response to the 360. Yet Paul-Jon McNealy, a video game industry analyst for American Technology Research, said that some game makers might delay the release of 360 titles until after the holidays, fearing that the market could be saturated. In any case, of all of the games at the event in Amsterdam this week, none will be watched more closely than Microsoft's \"Perfect Dark Zero.\" When the original Xbox was released in 2001 there were only about 15 games available at first. One of them, \"Halo,\" became a megahit that was almost single-handedly responsible for the Xbox's initial success. \"Perfect Dark Zero,\" another shooting game, may become the marquee title for the 360, though Microsoft hopes that more than 25 games for the 360 will be available this year. Microsoft demonstrated \"Perfect Dark Zero\" at the Electronic Entertainment Expo convention in May, but the game received a mixed review from industry experts because its graphics did not appear to be significantly better than the graphics in older games. Microsoft executives, however, say the production version of the 360 is much more powerful than the prototype used in May, and so games like \"Perfect Dark Zero\" look much better now than they did earlier in the year. The Xbox 360 has the advantage of reaching the market at least several months before its main competitors, the PlayStation 3 from Sony and Nintendo's new Revolution console, which are both expected next year. In fact, Evan Wilson, an analyst with Pacific Crest Securities, said that demand for the 360 had already exceeded his earlier projections and that sales could make Microsoft's game division profitable over the holiday quarter. But the 360's ability to overtake Sony, which dominates the game console market, by arriving first in stores is far from a sure thing. Analysts said that the first buyers of the 360 almost certainly will be hard-core gamers who will probably buy both a 360 and a PlayStation 3, if not a Revolution as well. "

                "Products on the cutting edge Fans of the Xbox are well acquainted with the late-night gaming habit and the toll it can take on a relationship. Installing Turtle Beach Ear Force X2 means never having to say \"Turn down that machine gun!\" The X2 consists of a base station, which connects to the stereo outputs on the Xbox, and a pair of wireless headphones with a built-in boom microphone. The base station sends stereo sound to the headphones over an infrared connection, but to talk on the Xbox Live service while playing, you must give up your wirelessness and connect the headphones to the Xbox controller with an included cable. The headphones, which weigh about 6 ounces, or 170 grams, are available online and at electronics stores. They can be used to listen to the audio from any home entertainment device, but the microphone only works with Xbox controllers. While headphones may cramp an expert player's style, these can prevent a groggy argument or two. -John Biggs (NYT) Your own PC desktop on a flash drive New flash drives from Lexar will come with software that lets you carry a virtual copy of your home computer in your pocket and surf the Web securely through other Windows machines.
